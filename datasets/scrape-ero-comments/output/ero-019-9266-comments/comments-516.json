        "comment": "Bike lanes and connected, safe cycling routes are essential to a world class city. We need more of them, not less. This is the right thing to do to discourage driving in the downtown core given the climate crisis. We should be using public transit and cycling NOT driving.\nI worked downtown for 30 years and only drove to work ONE time in all those years. When I started cycling to work in 1987 it was horribly dangerous. By the time I retired, it was getting safer, but still a disconnected network. Now it's finally getting properly safe with the addition of the Danforth dedicated bike lanes. Don't go backwards and start taking them away or blocking adding more. This is the way of the future. Go look at Amsterdam or Copenhagen. Get us to that and maybe people will finally stop the habit of one person per car driving to the downtown core. I rarely drive downtown. Leave it in a lot and take TTC or a bike share!\n"

        "comment": "The proposed legislation and associated regulations are deeply flawed on multiple levels.\nMost fundamentally, removal of existing bikelanes on Bloor St, Yonge St and University Avenue and halting of potential additional cycling infrastructure will, over time, worsen not improve congestion in Toronto. All available research indicates that increasing space available to cars simply induces more car journeys, rapidly undoing any immediate benefits that may be gained. At the same time, making alternative modes of transportation less attractive (less safe, more time consuming) must inevitably tend to encourage more people to use cars, ultimately worsening congestion. Ontario, like jurisdictions around the world, needs to come to terms with reality - the only way to reduce congestion is to enable, encourage and persuade more people to use modes of transportation other than cars, wherever feasible.\nIt is not obvious that removal of bike lanes would in fact result in additional vehicle lanes, unless this were to be combined with the removal of parking spaces and - specifically on Yonge St - removal of CafeTO patios - both of which would obviously have significant negative impacts on local businesses.\nRemoving bikelanes will have a negative impact on the safety of all road users, most obviously but not only cyclists. Street design of streets with bikelanes is also safer and more comfortable for the high volumes of pedestrian traffic that exist on these streets. They create a barrier between pedestrians and motor vehicles and narrow the road lanes that must be crossed by pedetrians, making for a safer crossing.\nThe proposal clearly works against goals to reduce carbon emissions, in promoting cars at the expense of cyclists and pedestrians.\nThe proposals fundamentally undermine local democracy. Decisions around the allocation of municipal road space do not have province-wide implications and the debates and design should be left to municipal councils.\nFinally, spending our taxpayers' money on what appears to be a politically motivated stunt is fiscally irresponsible.\nResident, Yonge and St Clair, Toronto\n"

        "comment": "I object to this legislation. It is anti-democratic, running roughshod over local decision making. Removing existing bike lanes without installing replacement bike routes following the same level of public consultation as when they were introduced is particularly egregious. Removing existing bike lanes is based on flawed logic. Bike usage statistics being quoted by elected government officials are highly mis-leading. The low bike usage numbers being quoted are not based on local data but use aggregated data for the Census Metropolitan Area, including the car-dependant 905 cities and rural communities like Caledon, East Gwillimbury and Whitchurch-Stouffville. Biking data for these communities is not comparable to central Toronto. Non-commuter bike trips for shopping, social, recreation and other purposes are also not counted. Existing bike lanes on Bloor, University or Yonge Street are part of a network of bike routes. Removing safe cycling infrastructure will discourage bike users likely leading to increased automobile traffic, more death and injury for bikers. And this does absolutely nothing to improve traffic congestion on other major routes like the DVP, Gardiner, Highway 401. This is very flawed public policy.\n"

Many are used in conjunction by cyclists using the bike shares to get to subway stations.\nThere needs to be more safety for cyclists, I would rather there be dedicated lanes away from the dangers of vehicular traffic. Census data does not include people using the bike lanes under a certain age, with many who use them to get to school. Nor does this Bill address those who wish to cycle more, or use other means of transportation, but do not simply because the infrastructure does not exist.\nThis isn't even to begin to consider how bike lines are almost non existent, or incomplete in most parts of the city.\n"

Biking on streets like Dundas is a harrowing experience as you have to contend with cars on your left and car doors on your right. The protection that Bloor street bike lanes offer cannot be understated, and I believe that their removal would constitute a great loss to our city. I am confident that the actual amount of people who commute by bike is higher than 2% as stated in the 2021 city census, as many of us were working from home at the time. In addition, Bike Share TO numbers have been rising steadily for years. I do not see bike lanes on side streets as an acceptable replacement, as there are no direct routes for these thoroughfares. The removal of these bike lanes would entail a costly investment in destroying green infrastructure which provides transportation for many low income people, and keeps our families safe on the roads. Thank you for your time, I hope our voices will be heard.\n"

        "comment": "Schedule 2 Comments:\nI am vehemently opposed to this proposed bill. The province of Ontario should focus on provincial jurisdiction such as healthcare and education and allow municipalities to manage their internal affairs. Bike lanes are a crucial, low-cost aspect of urban transportation. They improve cyclist safety, reduce gridlock by providing a reliable alternative to driving in the city core, and contribute to lowering greenhouse gas emissions. The majority of streets with bike lanes would not magically have a lane added upon removal of the bike lanes since the rightmost lane will generally be reserved for street parking. Bloor street, for example, will only have one lane of through traffic if the bike lanes were removed and perhaps slightly wider traffic lanes. Moreover, removal of bike lanes will force cyclists to assume the safest lane of traffic and slow vehicles to cycling speeds. This is a spiteful and ineffective piece of proposed legislation that isn't worth the paper it's printed on. The Ford government should be ashamed of itself.\nSchedule 3 Comments:\nI oppose the governments underhanded motion to exempt the Highway 413 project from the Environmental Assessment Act. This is a regressive and short-sighted approach to strong-arm a useless highway. The proposed highway 413 appears to be nothing but a grift to funnel public funds to private development corporations. Building more highways does not reduce traffic and the projected time savings for drivers is unlikely to be realized.\nSchedule 4 Comments:\nYour government campaigned on eliminating government waste and yet this proposal appears to add a layer of bureaucracy and interferes with municipal government affairs. I oppose this portion of the act. Municipalities are best-positioned to make bylaws and plan for urban transportation. The Province should stay out of the way. Cycling infrastructure in urban centers are an important, desirable feature to create livable neighborhoods. Our reliance only on automobiles for transportation is deplorable, inefficient, and damaging to the environment.\nSchedule 5 Comments:\nI oppose this. This schedule appears to remove a city's ability to restrict towing companies in certain areas - allowing any tow truck operators. I had my car forcefully towed while experiencing a breakdown by a borderline thieving tow company despite having a CAA truck en-route and was forced to pay to retrieve my vehicle. Private tow companies are need more restrictions to prevent unethical, borderline criminal behaviour. i do not support deregulation of restricted tow zones.\n"

It is imperative that we address the safety of all road users, particularly those who are vulnerable, such as cyclists and pedestrians, rather than focusing solely on motorists. I have a six-year-old daughter with a disability that prevents her from ever driving, and I am deeply concerned about her navigating an environment that does not prioritize her safety.\nThe provincial government should not add bureaucracy that hinders local efforts to improve transportation and reduce car traffic. The housing crisis is partly due to municipal red tape slowing construction; don't let this happen with new infrastructure projects.\nI frequently cycle to the Ajax GO station; however, it is occasionally unsafe. The new proposal may significantly hinder Ajax's ability to develop safe infrastructure for cyclists. If this situation arises, I may be compelled to revert to driving, which would contribute to increased traffic congestion.\nLastly, when I drive, it is more efficient and safer for everyone if cyclists are in their own protected lanes. This prevents traffic from being impeded by sharing the road with cyclists.\n"

We have a subway system, streetcar tracks, and bike lanes. There is no need for the majority of Torontonians to be driving for their commute or even on a frequent day to day basis.\nThis is a shameful overreach of provincial powers and will lead to injuries, deaths, more polluted air, and in the mid-term to long-term, MORE cars on the road resulting in equal congestion issues.

        "comment": "This government is once again over stepping and inserting itself into the MUNICIPAL matters of the City of Toronto. These are MUNICIPAL roads paid for by the tax payers of TORONTO. The bike lanes that were installed were paid for by the tax payers of TORONTO. This is NOT a provincial matter and this government has absolutely ZERO business inserting itself into this decision.\nBike lanes are designed for the use of local people living in the City of Toronto. Municipal and local roads are designed to be just that, roads for LOCAL residents of the City of Toronto, not for 905 commuters driving into this City. I thought the Ford government was all about increasing the use of public transit! This will only trick people into thinking that it's now more convenient to drive, only to find out, whooops, now there are even more cars on the road, and guess what? The space formerly occupied by bike lanes is now being used for....wait for it...parked cars??? In a long line of asinine, wasteful and utterly nonsensical ideas that this government has concocted, this has to be the most asinine idea yet! How much money is this government going to waste on this? Is this government prepared to pay the City back for the millions it has spent installing these lanes? And what does this government actually think will be achieved by this? Do you really think this will stop cyclists from riding on Bloor? NO! It will ensure that cyclists are now mixed in with vehicular traffic, making it extremely unsafe for all. And guess what? I for one will be taking up my right to occupy the FULL lane and will be riding in the middle of the road to ensure no vehicle can pass me and risk my safety. This will surely speed up everyone's commute, right? You people are absolutely out of your minds.\nI know it's probably very hard for a 50+ year old obese man to understand, but people who are choosing an active mode of transportation are actually helping out all those fat lazy people (like Ford) driving cars. Not only are cyclists REDUCING car congestion on roads (by not driving cars themselves) but they are also reducing environmental pollution and also increasing their health thereby reducing health care expenditures.\nIf this Bill passes it will be an absolute travesty, a total waste of tax payer money (again) and a total disaster. Not only will this idea not reduce congestion (it will do the opposite as many many many studies have proven) it will also increase cyclist injury and death. The blood of these victims and the tears of the victims friends and families will be on YOUR hands if this bill passes.\n"

        "comment": "It's ridiculous to take out the bike lanes and I will do everything I can to spread the word for who is responsible for making the city more congested and costing countless millions to do so. There are many reasons I'm against this:\n 1) Red Tape and Bureaucracy: The Ontario Premier needs to get out of the way of local governments and let them increase the transportation quality of cities. More streets = more drivers through induced demand, which is firmly established. Meddling from the top is only going to slow things down, especially when the Premier doesn't have anyone's interest at hear but his own.\n 2) I and many I know use bike lanes regularly as an alternative option, as busses, street cars, and subways aren't widespread enough to make it convenient to get everywhere in a timely fashion. Just look at how the share bike program is going and you'll see that it's clearly popular.\n 3) Basic safety should give cyclists their own space, as drivers often don't regard them at all, park on bike lanes, and kill cyclists all too frequently through negligence. They need their own lanes that are blockaded off with concrete to ensure their safety.\n 4) When I drive, it's much easier for cyclists to be out of the way in their own sectioned off lane so I don't have to be concerned about whether they can squeeze between me and the parked cars or other obstructions. I don't want to be responsible for accidental death due to bad infrastructure.\nOverall, it's a boondoggle that the Premier is pursuing to toss a bone to his backers in the construction industry. They were paid by his brother to put them in, and now they're getting the delicious double-dip of being contracted to take them out. It's clearly a porkbarrel project and the Premier should be investigated for corruption.\nI vehemently oppose this action. If you're not going to expand the lanes, at least let the cities decide what's best for them.\n"

        "comment": "It is not clear that any comments or facts will change this legislation but it is so wrong headed. I use Bloor, Yonge, and university bike lanes regularly and if they are removed it will force me to take more dangerous routes. Just the other night I took Harbord home not realizing it is under renovation and I was forced in amongst the traffic. I can\u2019t ride as fast as they want and it was so dangerous as cars and buses got frustrated with me. Once safe bike lanes are removed there will be more injuries and deaths.\nI am also an occasional car driver on those roads. I chose to use Bloor street because the car traffic is smooth and predictable. Cars turning have turn lanes. In contrast to DuPont where parked cars and turning cars often substantially slow traffic.\nIt is not bike lanes that slow traffic it is construction. University for example is constricted to one lane in each direction plus bikes at museum and again for the Ontario line at queen. tHAT is what slows traffic. Construction on nearby streets also plays havoc with traffic. For example Davenport has been one lane from avenue road to DuPont for some time. This has pushed traffic onto avenue road and increased left turns at DuPont creating enormous frustration on those people trying to go north on avenue road. If it were only so simple that removing bike lanes will solve the infrastructure problems the city has. The complete lack of public transportation is a major contributor. It is a dangerous blame game to target cyclists. People will die.\n"

        "comment": "I am appalled and embarrassed that the government of Ontario is even contemplating the proposed changes to the Highway Traffic Act.  You are supposed to represent the people of Ontario, not just a subset of the population who may be \"inconvenienced\" by congestion. I am both a driver and a cyclist, but I prioritize cycling wherever possible because it is better for the environment, better for my health, and less costly. Many people do not have a choice. They cycle because they cannot afford a car or do not have easy access to transit. They might be delivery drivers. They are often our young people - kids and teenagers who rely on their bike to get around. In other words, vulnerable people who need and deserve an integrated bike lane network to get around safely and quickly.\nI live in Toronto and the reason I can choose to cycle is because there is a network of bike lanes that keep me SAFE and allow me to get to my destination quickly. If you prohibit new bike lanes on municipal roads that are not within your jurisdiction, you are putting my safety and so many others at risk. You increase the chance that there will be a, potentially fatal, collision between cyclists and drivers. You also increase the chance that cyclists will drive instead, which only increases congestion and greenhouse gas emissions. This is not serving anyone - we literally ALL lose, just so you can get a few votes. This is very, very poor policy and so blatantly an attempt to pander to your base. It's disgusting. If there is even one death as a result of this legislation, you will have blood on your hands. On my commute to work I encounter at least 200 other cyclists in the bike lane. This is just a small snapshot in time (remember this is how counting works - I only count what I see, so there could be more or less after I pass by). We are out there and using these lanes daily. If you remove them, people are still going to cycle. But now we will be in a lane of traffic, risking the safety of both the cyclist and the driving. How is this a good outcome!\nI am also a land use planner. One of the key principles of planning is to provide a variety of mobility options. We also learn that a key way to get people OUT of their cars is to make other options, such as transit and cycling, more convenient. You are trying to do the exact opposite - to make driving the most convenient option, which will take people off of transit and bikes. This is backwards thinking (think 1950s suburbs). Why does the government of Ontario want to take us backwards???\nThe proposed legislation says that \"when considering whether to approve the design for the construction of a bicycle lane, the Ministry may consider whether it would unduly diminish the orderly movement of motor vehicle traffic.\". Why is this the only consideration? Why is this the only priority? You should also be considering whether it would unduly diminish the flow of transit, cyclists, pedestrians. You should also consider whether it has a negative impact on the environment.  Why do you ONLY CARE ABOUT MOTORISTS?\nThere are so many other ways to address congestion than to target vulnerable road users. You could better embower or compel municipalities to enforce cars that are illegally stopped or parked in travel lanes, especially during rush hour. I parked my bike at Yonge and Dundas yesterday morning and saw no less than 6 cars stopped in the right lane - this contributes greatly to congestion. I see this on every singly major road, whether there is a bike lane or not. You can work with municipalities to reduce lane closures from construction. You can work with authorities to improve response time to accidents and stalls on roads and highways so that the issue is moved out of a lane of traffic faster. And above all, you can focus your energy and money on getting people OUT OF CARS in the first place. Encourage transit use through incentives and improving service, actually finish the various LRT projects, push employers to make it more attractive to take transit or ride a bike (e.g. secure lock areas, change rooms). You can increase education for both cyclists and drivers so we can co-exist. You can look at ways to improve traffic flow at key bottlenecks. For example, when the Woodbine lanes went in caused backups because there was a dedicated left turn lane and a parking lane, resulting in only one lane both way. The City reassessed and changed the design slightly to remove the parking lane during rush hour and make the eft turn lane also a through lane. This improved flow and reduced back ups.\nPlease remember that CARS cause congestion, full stop. If there are less cars, there would be less congestion. Stop trying to blame cyclists and stop interfering with the good work of the City of Toronto who are taking this issue seriously. Admittedly there are some design issues with the Bloor west bike lane - fine, work with the City to reassess and resolve (see Woodbine example above). But don't take a broad brush and just take out bike lanes all over because of one isolated issue.\nI beg you to please reconsider this legislation and take a more reasonable, evidence based approach to dealing with congestion. Cyclists are real people who deserve to be treated with equal respect to your inconvenience drivers. There is a real climate crisis right now that you should care about. Let municipalities make their own decisions about their own road - the City of Toronto cares about cyclists and they care about climate impacts. Let them do their job since this draft legislation proves that you do not have our best interests in mind.\n"

I believe the removal of these bike lanes is detrimental to the city, detrimental to the province, and detrimental to Canada. We are removing urban transit, we are increasing gridlock, we are abandoning our climate goals, and we are abandoning vulnerable road users.\nAround the globe we have seen the concept of induced demand, more roads makes for more cars, which makes for more roads. The same applies to bicycle lanes, more bicycle lanes, a solid network of safe infrastructure, makes for more bikes. Moving into the future, where density increases, we need to focus on moving people not cars. This is not only good for the environment, this is good for those who choose to commute by car as there are simply less on the roads - COVID was remarkable for those travel times.\nI implore you to look at your commute. Hundreds of cars, each taking up 6x10 feet of road space to, for the most part, move a single person. What if we could put a fraction of those users on a bike or e-scooter? Each taking up far less space, and like people on a crowded sidewalk, flowing. The cars you're behind at the light don't have to be there and instead on a nice side lane, separated and out of the way. For these side lanes to be viable they also need to take people to where they need to go, small businesses on main roads, to work, to their friends and family.\nWhat is not better for mid-range (20km) commute than a bicycle that is powered by breakfast, clean, and quiet.  As you are in charge of leading this province you have the opportunity to be a leader here as well. We need to increase viable alternatives to driving so those who have to will have less traffic in there way. This includes building out public transit and bike infrastructure.\n"
