Bike lanes have been demonstrated to reduce injuries to cyclists, and in many jurisdictions bike lanes have been shown to reduce congestion. Citizens need options for safe mobility, especially the lowest cost options which include cycling. Cycling infrastructure also promotes healthy active lifestyles which reduce medical costs (given our Provincial government is also gutting healthcare, they could at least let us ride our bikes to stay healthy).\nThis proposal will not reduce congestion and will only increase costs, for this reason it should be withdrawn.\nThe powers provided to the Provincial Government in this proposal is an overreach and violates the rights of municipalities to plan their local infrastructure: for this reason the proposal should be withdrawn.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose this bill. It will lead directly to more cyclists being killed and injured; to more pollution and carbon emissions; to faster and more unsafe streets; to less cycling; and to the disempowerment of local democracy. Its benefits in terms of driving time are negligible, and emergency officials have said that bike lanes actually improve response times, contradicting false claims to the opposite effect.\nBike lanes are being put in by democratically elected governments with extensive public consultations. The province should keep out and focus on urgent issues like health care, education, housing, and the environment, all of which need a great deal more energy than this issue. The Ford government is deliberately using bike lanes to divide the electorate and divert attention from more serious issues.\nEncouraging driving is the last thing this province needs in 2024. This is not the 1960s any more! We cannot build our way out of gridlock; the only proven solutions are better public transit, encouraging active transit (bikes and walking), and congestion pricing. Look around: every other world class city proves this. Cities that choose to prioritize the car become less liveable, with poorer health outcomes, and still suffer gridlock.\nThank you for considering my views. I hope you will also consider the evidence and rescind Bill 212.\n"

Also this would create more red tape and cost a lot of money in bureaucratic approvals, in addition to being a political level of control over what should be routine municipal planning business.

        "comment": "I don't think Bill 212 will reduce gridlock or save time on traffic.\nMy personal experience:\nI started cycling intensively to work and to commute anywhere in the city when they improved/built more cycling infrastructure. I live above Christy Pitts Park in Toronto, and when Shaw Street became a dedicated bicycle street and they built Bloor bike lines, it was much more convenient for me to cycle than to use my car. I reduced my car use by more than 50 % from a few years ago. I'm faster cycling to work on the east end than if I use my car. No gas emissions, decrease the gridlock, and I'm doing cardio for good health.\nMy wife started to cycle to work daily and had the same experience.\nThere is enough data from the last couple of years from the city accessible to the public, proving that bike lines help more people move and transport themselves more efficiently than using cars instead.\nIf there are no bike lines on the road, many people will be discouraged from cycling. The main reason is the safety issues on the road without bike lines. People will start using their cars more, and you will have more gridlock and longer traffic time to get from point A to B.\nCycling is a good transportation alternative that will pay off in the long term. This is proven in many countries worldwide.\nWe must build more bike lines in the city and connect them with other municipalities to encourage people to cycle instead of driving their cars. More people on bicycles will significantly reduce the number of vehicles on the road, reduce gridlock, and save time in traffic.\nAs a taxpayer paying for the infrastructure I think roads are for all modes of transportation, and cars can't have the priorities over other users to use them.\nI\u2019m against this Bill 212 !!\n"

        "comment": "Ontario's objectives, to which the provincial government should align, ought to be to fight gridlock and get ALL Ontarians where they need to go - no matter what their mode of transportation. If this government is committed to representing all Ontarians equally, it would do well to consider dropping the notion that \"drivers\" are a monolithic identity group with the same interests. Secondly, municipal governments know their municipalities best - surely the provincial government has bigger priorities to focus on instead of meddling in municipal affairs? Last but not least, the implementation of new bicycle lanes (\u201cbike lanes\u201d) that require the removal or adjustment of an existing lane of traffic has been proven to improve safety - again, for ALL users of our public streets. Getting somewhere \"faster\" is the least of my worries and it is, frankly, insulting to hear that the provincial government thinks that that is a goal worth spending or wasting more money on. As someone who switches between being a pedesterian, cyclist, public transportation rider, and driver - I'd rather arrive alive than to risk my life just to save a few minutes of time.\n"

        "comment": "The bill's approach exemplified by this quote \"Ontario is looking to fight gridlock and get drivers where they need to go faster\" is wrong and outdated. At a time when cities around the world are implementing measures to make transportation safe by enforcing speed limits, reducing road width, installing barriers to speeding, and yes, by building more bike lanes and sidewalks, this bill appeals to an outdated cultural norm of the car being the main mode of transportation. At a time when many neighbourhoods in Ontario don't have sidewalks, cities are struggling to finance public transportation due to lack of funds, and the province fails to complete public transit projects that would help thousands of people travel quickly and safely, this bill prioritizes the needs of drivers. But this is not 1960!\nIn addition to destroying the environment and communities, building more highways is the surest way to increase gridlock. Appearing to shift the blame, the \"anti-bike lane\" lobby (which is ecstatic about this bill), claims that bike lanes result in gridlock. The fallacy of this argument has been demonstrated numerous times, including a recent CBC review of evidence: https://www.cbc.ca/news/science/bike-lanes-impacts-1.7358319#:~:text=On\u2026\nAmongst all the commuter and recreational cyclists using bike lanes, today's urban residents rely on bike couriers to deliver food and parcels. It is immoral to expose these couriers, many of whom come from underprivileged communities, to potentially lethal accidents by removing safe bike lanes! Finally, the health needs of our children and seniors require safe active transportation infrastructure. This is where this bill sends a wrong message. The last thing we need is for people to drive more. Instead, let's help people stay active at any age by creating more, not fewer, safe active transportation options.\n"

This finally gave me the opportunity to try biking my kid to school, and then myself to my office. Now this is my normal way of getting around. We have a car but it sits parked in the driveway most of the time now. Many of my neighbours have made similar changes to their commute patterns over the years.\nIf the Yonge bike lane is removed, I will go back to driving everywhere. I am not prepared to bike in mixed traffic especially with my kid in the bike seat. It will be too dangerous.\nWithout good bike infrastructure, people will go back into cars and this will cause more traffic.\nThink it through.\n"

        "comment": "The Provincial Government needs to stay in its own lane and leave the planning of local transportation to the residents, municipal politicians, local transportation experts of Toronto. This is a anti-democratic case of governmental over-reach.\nRipping out bike lanes that have the support of residents and business owners will not reduce congestion. Induced demand means that opening up space on a roadway induces more people to drive. We need is to efficiently use the road space available while ensuring everyone \u2014 pedestrians, drivers, delivery workers and cyclists \u2014 can get to their destination safely and sustainably. This requires the consideration of complex needs and contexts: the climate emergency, the lack of funding for public transit, delays to major transit projects, endless construction projects blocking lanes, the lack of access to safe cycling routes, and, finally, the lack of disincentives for people to drive into the downtown core (often one person per car) instead of taking transit.\nInstead of ripping out bike lanes or digging an enormous money pit (aka a tunnel under the 401 for an estimated cost of $55 billion), here are some alternative ideas:\nopen the Eglinton LRT and Finch LRT\nintroduce a congestion charge for people driving into the downtown core during peak hours\nincentivize car-pooling\nreduce transit fares\nzero-rate the tolls for all truck traffic that uses the 407 and negotiate a bulk payment deal with the 407\u2019s owners by way of compensation OR negotiate with the owners of the 407 to buy out the lease once and for all.\nbuild more east-west transit service north of the 401, e.g., new express GO bus service, or a rapid transit corridor situated in the vast hydro corridor that runs alongside the 407.\n"

First we had to pay to install them and now pay to rip them out with no evidence that bike lanes reduce travel time for cars.\nYou want to encourage people to use other methods of transportation other than cars if you want to reduce traffic - such as bikes.\nStart with removing on street parking on major roads first. Those parked cars do a lot more to slow down traffic than bikes.\nAlso, why is the provincial government getting involved with city planning? Talk about government over reach.

        "comment": "Bike lanes are not what causes congestion. There are so many cars on the road because our public transportation options suck. A large number of vehicles at any given point are going in the same direction or to a similar destination - if we had better public transit that was frequent and accessible, there would be no need for everyone to individually drive themselves to where they are going. Bikes are far from the problem here, and should not be regulated as if they are. On the contrary, they are a more environmentally friendly option and should be encouraged wherever possible. The vagueness of what criteria will dictate whether or not a bike lane can be constructed is also very concerning - it creates the impression that they will always be denied because it reduces traffic lanes for cars. This is a horrible idea overall and will result in more cycling/vehicle accidents, harm the environment, and still not reduce gridlock.\n"

Why is the province wasting its time and resources micro managing municipalities?\nSecond, ripping out existing bike lines is just a stupid waste of money.\nYou want to reduce gridlock? Reduce the number of people in cars. Thats it. That is literally the only way. There is endless data demonstrating this. You will not solve gridlock with new lanes, or by pissing away billions of dollars on a tunnel. You need to\na) Divert people away from high density areas. People should not be growing THROUGH Toronto unless their destination is in Toronto\nb) Providing effective alternative transport methods such as robust public transit and avenues for active transport (LIKE BIKE LANES), so people can do things other then drive.\nc) Change zoning laws to allow for more mixed use neighbourhoods so more people can live close to where they work so they dont have to commute, or at the very least, live close to shops and services so they can access the majority of what they need either without a car, or with a very short drive.\nBlatantly ignoring evidence based solutions because the Premier has decided he has a beef with bike lanes for some reason will make gridlock worse, not better, and your time and tax payer money would be better spent addressing issues like Healthcare and Education, that are actually the province's responsibility, instead of micromanaging municipal affairs. If the Premier wants to be mayor of Toronto so badly, he should resign and run in the next election, and leave being Premier to someone who knows what they are doing\n"

        "comment": "This legislation is a mistake that will significantly reduce the ability of Ontario\u2019s cities to adapt to transportation and environmental needs going forward. Not everyone in our cities owns a car, and by legislating preference for drivers over other individuals using our roads, this legislation will only increase congestion by encouraging more people to drive, doing the exact opposite of what it is designed to do. Studies have repeatedly shown that bike lanes reduce congestion and fatalities on roads. For example, see attached a link to a strong endorsement of bike lanes by the Canadian Paediatric Society.\nMoreover, as someone who lives in a downtown core and doesn\u2019t own a car, this legislation seems to establish an explicit preference for residents of the suburbs who need to visit downtown over local residents, many of whom use bikes and other forms of active transportation to visit local businesses and commute to work.\nFinally, this legislation is an assault on municipal decision-making powers; the provincial government does not know better than local governments whether a bike lane is needed on a specific road, and any process for reviewing and removing these lanes will be a significant waste of time and public money, while making our cities less liveable in the process.\nLocking in a car-centric status quo that has repeatedly proven to be costly in time, money, and the lives of road users is not the answer. Please reconsider this legislation.\n"

        "comment": "The stated, abstract objective of this Act is to reduce \u201cgridlock,\u201d using means which are proven to be detrimental to public health and safety, mobility and access to Ontario communities for all people, environmental protection, and will aid in worsening the ongoing climate emergency.\nDespite having the authority to do so per the Municipal Act, requiring provincial approval for construction of new bike lanes where they \u201creplace a lane of traffic\u201d is a dramatic overreach of government authority in the affairs of municipalities. This is meddlesome and suggests the provincial government doesn\u2019t have faith or trust in municipalities to manage their own affairs, and further suggests that the provincial government isn\u2019t interested in local democracy\u2014bike lanes aren\u2019t constructed without warning; they are built only after an extensive planning process, which includes considerable research and community input.\nFurthermore, it is an objective fact that more car lanes will not reduce traffic congestion: the concept of Induced Demand indicates that with more car lanes, there is more traffic. This phenomenon has been observed all over the world. If this government were serious about \u201creducing gridlock,\u201d it would be making investments to the tune of several billion dollars to prioritize development and construction of extensive transit projects all over the province, and would invest considerable time, money and effort into the construction of more, comprehensive cycling networks. One more bike on the road is one less car; bikes take up far less space on the road than a single occupancy vehicle, thereby making more room for those who are or who must drive.\nIt is important to mention as well that the three bike lanes Premier Ford has pledged to remove in Toronto also see thousands of users per day\u2014that\u2019s literally thousands of cars that are off the road as a result. Local businesses are more successful in areas with bike lanes (this is easily proven looking at the Bloor Bike Lane reports prepared by City staff in Toronto), and various Toronto BIAs have already come out in support of bike lanes and the detrimental impact their removal would have on local businesses.\nCycling is also the far healthier option: physical activity leads to better health outcomes which leads to less money required for healthcare services.\nInstallation of bike lanes also have the added advantage of making the entire streetscape safer to use for all mobility modes; cars, bikes, pedestrians, and all others. Their existence can save the lives of cyclists and many others. Six cyclists have died on Toronto streets this year, and that is six too many; innocent lives lost because the victims were trying to get across town. Utterly senseless, with families shattered as a result.\nPertaining to bike lanes, my final comment is that the existence of these lanes gives all people greater access to their municipality. Those without the financial means to own a car, pay for insurance, parking, gas, etc. are more able to traverse their municipality for work, recreation, and to support the local economy. A car-centric community is a community that closes itself off to a considerable portion of its population.\nOn the topic of exempting 413 lands from environmental assessments, this is yet another short-sighted policy that will result in disastrous outcomes for the environment. The area where the highway is intended to be built is environmentally sensitive land. Once paved over, that land is lost as a carbon sink, a natural habitat for native flora and fauna, and as a floodplain/natural flood control measure\u2014forever. The proposal that this highway should be exempted from any environmental assessment to expedite development suggests the government doesn\u2019t care whatsoever about the environment and, again, is not serious about eliminating gridlock: as mentioned above, the concept of induced demand means that on completion, it will create more gridlock and spew more harmful greenhouses gas emissions into the atmosphere. Here, again, I must emphasize that if the government is serious about reducing gridlock, the only way forward is to invest in and build a massive public transit infrastructure, and augment municipal streets with alternative means of mobility, such as bike lanes.\nI question whether any planners, environmentalists, engineers or any other credentialed experts were consulted at all in the creation of this bill.\nIn summary, Bill 212 is a backwards approach to \u201creducing\u201d gridlock which will have the complete opposite effect of its stated objective: gridlock will become worse, public safety will be worse, local economies will suffer, the environment will be senselessly, irreparably destroyed, and health outcomes for Ontarians will be worse, which will end up costing us more. This bill should not move forward.\n"
