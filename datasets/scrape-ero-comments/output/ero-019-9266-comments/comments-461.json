How is removing bike lanes going to help. Why not give more tickets to drivers on their phones while driving or stopped at a light. Many of times drivers miss a left turn light because they are busy on their phones. Or give more tickets to vehicles stopping in a no stopping zones. Another stupid idea by removing bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "I'm writing as I have significant concern about the upcoming Bill 212 \"Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act\".\nI am firstly concerned about the changes relating to requiring municipalities to obtain government approval before adding bike lanes where vehicle lanes are removed, and the review of any bicycle lanes that have been constructed in the last five years.  My family are avid cyclists.  We often cycle, including our three year old son, to do our errands around North Bay, and I strongly believe that bicycle lanes ensure our safety, while we work to reduce our environmental impact, to stay healthy and to foster a love of movement and the outdoors in our son.  It is my understanding that this legislation should have a limited impact on our local bike lanes, as they are mostly older, but we often travel to other cities where we enjoy using their bike lanes to sightsee safely and I worry that that may be in jepordy.  I also look forward to future bike lanes being constructed in North Bay and I believe that is a decision that should rest with our municipality, not with the provincial government.  Many traffic studies support the fact that bike lanes do not make gridlock worse and can in fact help with traffic flow.\nI am also concerned about the changes relating to exempting the 413 Highway project from the Environmental Assessment Act.  There are already a lot of environmental concerns with any project of this scale and it is so important that they receive a full environmental assessment to ensure that the right decisions are being made.  We live in a beautiful province and it is cruicial that we respect the environment where we are living so that it can continue to be enjoyed for lifetimes to come.  I ask you to consider the lasting damage an enormous project like this could have on the environment of all Ontarians, all in an effort to reduce commuting times for a small subset of Ontarians.  There is also much research does to show that increasing traffic capacity makes only a temporary reduction in commuting times, until more vehicles are on the road.  I strongly believe that we should be investing that money in research-backed ways to reduce traffic, such as public transportation (I am eagerly awaiting the Northlander train next year), bicycle lanes, etc.\n"

        "comment": "I have multiple concerns about the removal of bike lanes and will attempt to be brief, or at the very least concise.\n- The targeted bike lanes for removal are exclusively in Toronto. This is at its core a gross misuse of taxpayer money, particularly for non-Toronto residents. Why should a resident of Kingston be paying for the removal of bike lanes in Toronto? These are pieces of infrastructure that have zero impact on residents outside of the targeted municipality and should ONLY have local taxpayer money spent on them.\n- Even if it were only local taxpayer money being used for the removal, it is still a gross misuse of taxpyer money considering many of the lanes were just put in. These are lanes that were not placed on a whim, but were implemented after years of deliberation and policy. Yet the province has promised to remove them within days of promising to do so. This makes close to no sense.\n- The proposed routes that will have bike lanes removed still allow street parking. Even if we forget about bike lanes for a moment, many large cities globally with good traffic flow do not have street parking on their main arteries. Street parking should be the first thing to go. It is unproductive for traffic flow. Bike lanes, however, are productive for traffic flow as they remove cars from the road.\n- Safety: you can remove bike lanes from roads, but cyclists will not stop using those roads. This will be a death sentence. Our cycling infrastructure in Toronto is good but removing these lanes will further disjoint it. A cyclist that needs to get from Yonge & Bloor to Christie & Bloor will take Bloor. They will not use winding side streets or deviate multiple blocks south/north just to use an approved bike lane.\n- Cyclists are legally entitled to using the entire lane of traffic when there is no bike lane. By removing bike lanes on these streets you may inadvertently be creating more traffic.\n- 100 cyclists using a bike lane over an hour will make the lane look empty, but even if just 70 people use cars instead to get from point A to point B, that is a considerable amount of traffic. We should be focusing on removing cars from our roads, not adding them.\n- Globally, the cities that \"just work\" and have vibrant communities all have cycling and pedestrian infrastructure. The trend, globally, is to add bike lanes. Not remove them.\nI'm assuming none of my points are new but the fact of the matter is that this is a step backwards. I understand the province's desire to improve traffic flow, but you can have both. Bike lanes on University Ave, for instance, are fairly wide. They can still exist, but be slimmed down to a more appropriate size. I would also like to remind the province of street parking on these streets. It is unproductive from all angles other than minor convenience for the very few.\n"

It is far less stressful to drive when the bikers are separated into their own bike lanes compared to before when they were weaving in and out of car traffic and/or having the cars weave around them if the biker is riding in the curb lane.\nPlus, it seems to me that having boundary separated bike lanes are far more safer for everyone!\n"

        "comment": "I am beyond disappointed by the government's proposal to remove bike lanes from important routes in Toronto and make it more difficult for Ontario cities to install such important infrastructure. I grew up in Oshawa. I loved riding my bike but it wasn't safe to do so and it became very clear to me that cars are the prioritized mode of transportation. Moving to Toronto, I was so excited to walk and bike around the city. As more bike lanes were built, such as University, Yonge Street, Bloor, and Danforth lanes, I became motivated to choose riding a bike even more. Biking is great for my health, physically and mentally, and it's quick, convenient, and fun. The decision to remove the bike lanes I and others depend on is a huge mistake. The Ford government says it will make it faster to drive around? I'm also a driver and know that's a lie.  Studies from organizations such as Cycle Toronto, TCAT, not to mention European cities that embrace cycling, clearly show that delays on our roads are not because of bike lanes. As long as we encourage more cars on the road instead of supporting other methods of transportation, it will always be a slog to drive in the city and will only get worse. Most importantly, I am horrified to see more and more people die on our roads because our infrastructure is not safe. Enough is enough. Please do not support this proposal. Let's keep our bike lanes and build more and make our roads safer for all users.\n"

The same goes for my mother, who is 77. Without those lanes, we will drive. We are not willing to risk our lives among the cars.\nRemoving bike lanes is telling citizens like us to get back in their cars and contribute to the city's paralyzing gridlock and carbon emissions.

This additional layer of red tape and bureaucracy stifles local decision-making and creates unnecessary obstacles for communities looking to improve their transportation infrastructure. Bike lanes are essential infrastructure, offering a safe and accessible transportation option for cyclists while also making roads simpler and safer for drivers by providing clear spaces for all road users. Furthermore, bike lanes complement transit investments by creating a more integrated and sustainable transportation network, supporting Ontario\u2019s environmental and public health goals.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes is the most haenous idea possible. We are facing the consequences of Global Warming and finding ways to reduce our carbon foot print are essential to the future of our planet and generations to come. Electric cars are not and will not be the solution for many years still to come. Additionally, despite reducing the reliance on fossil fuels for transportation the by-products of creating and disposing of car batteries are extremely harmful to the environment. Biking is an accessible, affordable, zero footprint way to commute. Additionally, it provides a way to get active in the city where green spaces are significantly limited. More active Torontians means improved physical and mental health and hopefully reduced burden on health care. If you're trying to reduce traffic, getting rid of bike lanes IS NOT the way to do it - now you're making people rely on driving to work instead of giving them the easy option of biking. By removing bike lanes you're also creating a huge safety risk for cyclists! Drivers are often distracted and not paying attention to cyclists, so by having a bike lane it creates more separation between cyclists and drivers. Look at cities across the world that have a strong cycling culture. It is possible to make the city less congested and improve traffic but removing a method of transportation - i.e., cycling - is not the way to do it. It feels like the government is making the city less accessible and more dangerous to live in.\n"

        "comment": "Removing existing bike lanes when they are already built is one of the dumbest things to come out of this government, EVER.\nEver since the pandemic the uptake of cycling has increased at a faster rate than automobiles.   Yet there are still many that will hesitate to ride until safe and convenient passage has been created.\nI cycle along Eglinton west regularly where apparently an LRT is being built.   From Islington over to Avenue is a hodgepodge of bike lane segments.  They start and stop frequently.  When a segment ends, I cycle 3 feet out from the curb, for my own safety.  It forces cars to switch lanes to get around me rather than risk clipping me.    Does it slow down traffic?   Of course.   Would it speed up traffic if the bike lane was continuous?   You tell me\u2026\nAlong the way I could veer up to side streets here and there.   It isn\u2019t always possible because of river crossings and ravines.   There are many parked cars on side streets which are hazardous to cyclists.  There are schools and children playing in the streets.   Besides, when I am cycling somewhere I often have tight timelines so why shouldn\u2019t I take the most direct route on a major road.   Cars can.\nOne  thought on Yonge Street.   It is a nightmare for cyclists and pedestrians.   As a pedestrian I often have to walk on the road because of overcrowded sidewalks.   The sidewalks from the lake to Eglinton should be widened.   The bike lane\u2019s kept and thought should be given to closing Yonge entirely, at least to Bloor.   But of course that is a municipal issue not provincial.\nWhat about bike lanes elsewhere?   Try riding in Prince Edward County or Niagara on a weekend.   The cars move very quickly and so very often the shoulder is gravel, even after a road has been repaved.   How about increasing safety for cyclists throughout the province and giving tourism a boost by doing something progressive.   Make it law that whenever a municipality or County replaces or creates a new road that it be mandatory that sufficient hardtop be laid to safely accommodate cyclists.\n"

It doesn't take much to see that if you build proper bike infrastructure, they will come.\nThis notion that bike lanes aren't being used enough to justify them is because the existing network is so few and far between, so poorly maintained and so unsafe in parts that many people are simply put off.\nYou are chastising bike lanes for their lack of use BECAUSE of your own failures to bring Toronto in line with the rest of the world's minimum standard offered to current and prospective cyclists.\nI take the longer route to work to ensure I can stay on a bike lane because I don't feel safe elsewhere. The other month I was knocked off my bike within seconds of leaving said bike lane by a driver who wasn't looking. My thought since has been: how often would that kind of thing happen if I didn't have that bike route at all? How much worse could it have been? That's the fear you'll be condemning so many Torontonians to if you remove the paltry start this city has made to its cycling network.\nMy partner and I are immigrants and young professionals who have lived here for a combined 14 years.

        "comment": "I do not support this proposal. For many reasons,\nFirst, I believe it is an over reach of the provincial government. The provincial government should not be adding more bureaucracy and red-tape to city level planning. What is best for a city should be determined by the city and the residents of it. I do not think that it is right that traffic in one city (Toronto) should be used as evidence that this proposal is correct for every city (Ottawa).\nSecondly, I do not think that this proposal accurately reflects the public interest. This proposal focuses only on movement of motor vehicle traffic. The only reference to any sort of criteria for consideration of a proposed bicycle lane is \"[...] whether it would unduly diminish the orderly movement of motor vehicle traffic\"\nThere are many reasons why you should or should not dedicate public land to a bicycle lane. It is wrong to only consider the impact it would have the trip time of citizens who are able bodied enough to drive, financially secure enough to own and maintain a private vehicle and choose to use an automobile to make a trip. There are many people who either cannot or do not want to drive, this includes every single child under the age of 16 who cannot legally drive. Many of these people would greatly benefit from the addition of a bicycle lane but their needs are not considered in the current proposal.\nIf it makes sense to require the Ministry to approve potential bike lanes, it should at least require the ministry to consider more than just the trip time of automobiles.\nIt should consider how much a bike lane will improve the safety of bicyclists. I do not think the need for a driver to get to their destination on time is more important than a cyclist's life. There is a reason why we allow children to bicycle on the sidewalk, because we know a cyclist sharing the road with automobiles is inherently unsafe and we don't want to subject our children to that danger. For our youth having dedicated bicycle infrastructure is useful for getting around without the need for an adult chauffeur.\nThe Ministry should consider how much bicycle traffic the new bicycle lanes will generate. Right now there is a clear desire from citizens for safer bicycle infrastructure. From the City of Toronto Cycling Study from July 2019, over 1 in 3 respondents (35%) said that \"they would like to travel\nmore by bike if the streets felt safer and there was dedicated bike infrastructure.\" This means there are a lot of people who would like to make more trips by bicycle who are not because the infrastructure is not in place. These respondents are not currently making trips by bicycle, so they are most likely traveling by other means, most likely automobile. These are people who are in cars contributing to the city gridlock because they feel compelled to drive due to the lack of safe bicycle infrastructure. By building safe bicycle infrastructure that is useful in that it connects places people are to places people want to go, it will remove drivers from the roads. Furthermore this 1 in 3 number are only people who do not currently bicycle. Only 21% of respondents said \"they are not comfortable riding a bicycle even on path or trails or are just not interested in cycling\" this means that 79% of respondents, a substantial majority, would benefit from safe, dedicated bicycle infrastructure in one way or another. There are a lot of people who want this infrastructure, so to consider rejecting it (or removing it) based solely on how it affects the movement of motor vehicle traffic is not representative of the true public's interests.\nIt should also consider if the bicycle infrastructure increases the people's freedom of choice. Right now there is substantially more infrastructure to support driving over any other form of transportation. Currently it is possible to drive everywhere and additional forms of transportation are optionally added on. This means that for certain trips you are pretty much all but required to get there by motor vehicle. By denying or removing bicycle infrastructure you take away people's freedom to choose how they navigate their city. If a person has to choose between risking bodily harm or driving then is that really a choice?\nI can confidently say that this proposal does not fit my interests, I often find it troublesome that if I want to go to the grocery store that's 1.2 km from my house I can either drive, where all the streets are designed to make it easy and the large parking lot in front of the store makes it easy for me to store my private vehicle completely free while I shop. However, I have started trying to bike to the store and it's a very different experience. The 1.2 km doesn't have any bicycle infrastructure. So if I want to be a law abiding citizen I have to bike on the road. The trip requires biking on a major road, because the grocery store itself is on that major road so it would be subject to this proposal. This road has no dedicated bicycle infrastructure so even though the trip is short it feels dangerous ... so inevitably I have stopped going to the store by bike and have started driving again. I would like to stop being in my car taking up space on the road for the people who are trying to get somewhere they need to go by car just so that I can travel my 1.2km to my grocery store.\nSo there are so many more reasons why a bicycle lane should or should not be considered than just the movement of motor vehicles, and there will be no one size fits all solution for the entire province and no one would be able to better determine if a new bicycle lane would be beneficial for the city as a whole more than the city!\nThirdly, as a driver in a city I think this proposal makes trips worse for drivers. From the same 2019 study, 17% of respondents said that they are willing to bicycle on the street regardless of traffic and without dedicated bicycle lanes. As a driver I would prefer that these bicyclists have their own lane. Sharing the road with a bicyclist makes a drive worse. Bicyclists often can not reach the speed limit on major roads, they are slower to accelerate after coming to a full stop at a traffic light. This can affect the speed of traffic of the vehicles around them. It would be much better when I am driving to not need to deal with a bicyclist on the road and either being stuck behind them, or needing to navigate around them.\nFinally, I believe that a bicycle lane most likely doesn't impact the movement of motor vehicles as the proposal seems to suggest. In Ottawa the one-way street of O'Connor underwent a transformation to change it from 4 lanes (during rush hour) of motor vehicle traffic to two-lanes of motor vehicle traffic, a protected bi-directional bicycle lane and a dedicated parking lane. O'Connor St is a major road that connects downtown to highway 417. While I do not have the data I would be shocked if the change to O'Connor St would have passed this proposal. I will admit that when I learned they were removing 2 lanes I thought for sure that the traffic which was already atrocious, was going to get substantially worse. However as someone who routinely drove down O'Connor during rush hour to get the 417 both before and after the rework, I can state from personal experience that the rework of street greatly improved the experience of driving on it. Even though the amount of lanes dedicated to driving went from 4 full lanes, during rush hour, to 2 lanes. I am now confident that the majority of traffic that I experienced on O'Connor during rush hour was primarily due to the ineffective parking restrictions that should have cleared the street at that time but were often ignored, causing 2 of the lanes to constantly need to merge back into the other 2 lanes. By converting one of these lanes to a dedicated bicycle lane it did not have the horrible effect on traffic I had forecast but instead made driving much better and more efficient! While this is only 1 road and 1 person's experience, I cannot believe that this is an isolated scenario. I have come to believe that the best way to clear up grid lock is to get people who don't need to be on the road for their trip off the roads.\nSo in conclusion, I believe that this proposal is both over reaching for the provincial government and short sighted. I do not believe the proposal will have the intended effect of reducing gridlock by preventing or removing bicycle lanes from replacing lanes of traffic. All it will do is make the lives more dangerous for 79% of the city who want to use a bicycle in some form and it will also make the lives worse for the other 21% of people in cars who now have to share the road with a slow cyclist.\n"
