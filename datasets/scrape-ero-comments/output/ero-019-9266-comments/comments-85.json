I\u2019m a concerned citizen in Etobicoke, and I think it\u2019s completely irresponsible to circumvent the typical procedures required for bike lane implementation. Moreover, bike lane proposals that involve removing a traffic lane shouldn\u2019t be considered, they\u2019re far too negatively impactful for the majority of the community.\n"

I commute to the financial district year round and having access to both the Davenport and University bike lanes has made me feel safer and limited the risk of incidents with careless drivers. Removing vital infrastructure like bike lanes puts people like me at risk of careless drivers. Taking away existing bike lanes and removing the city\u2019s ability to put in new lanes without the province\u2019s approval is a massive overreach. DONT TOUCH OUR BIKE LANES.\n"

Instead of focusing on a single mode of transport, think holistically about all modes of transportation and offer comprehensive solutions to congestion such as\n1) Increase funding to public transportation within (TTC, YRT, MiWay, etc..) and across municipalities (GO transit to reduce connection wait times\n2) Increase number of dedicated HOV lanes to encourage communal modes of transport (such as public transit and ride sharing) to reduce number single occupancy vehicles\n"

        "comment": "The provincial power grab outlined is this bill is a jurisdictional overreach and clear attempt to further centralize power in the hands of the premier. This is something I would expect from the Justin Trudeau Liberals and am dismayed to see such tactics used by a party under the name Conservative.\nI would like to first see evidence that the bike lanes are what has caused the increase in traffic. When the 401 is backed up in Toronto or the 417 in Ottawa, where there are no bike lanes, what then is the cause of this traffic? In addition, why is it that Toronto, with a fairly small population for a city (when compared to most major cities like Paris, S\u00e3o Paulo, Mexico City, Tokyo, etc.) comes out as having some of the worst traffic in the world? Much worse than cities both with far more population and more densely packed?\nIf the point of this bill is in fact to reduce traffic, and not just to flame a culture war, then are you considering looking at alternatives? Ontario uses traffic lights at almost every intersection despite the fact that in many places roundabouts would significantly increase the flow of traffic. Better sensors could keep traffic lights more attuned to the flow of traffic. Better road design (including bike lanes) could reduce the number of collisions thus preventing traffic from getting backed up. Traffic lights could transition to amber before going to green to give drivers more notice and avoid a delay in traffic moving.\nIf we are being serious about fixing the problem of traffic, why is it that the solution given doesn\u2019t seem to promote any real solutions to fixing traffic and instead just targets a specific group? There is no special interest group more pandered to in Ontario than drivers. I am a lifelong Conservative voter and my viewpoint does not come from being \u201con the left\u201d. This is simply bad policy that seems to only want to inflame culture war rather than actually fix issues.\n"

        "comment": "I am strongly opposed to any bill that would remove existing bike lanes, or introduce unnecessary red tape to stop cities adding new bike infrastructure.\nI am not able to drive. Learning to travel by bike is what allowed me to get off of welfare (couldn't afford a bus pass in those days, nevermind a car), go to college, and get a job where I could support myself. Today riding a bicycle is what allows me to go to work, the doctors office, or the grocery store.\nIf the existing bike lanes are removed, I will still have to ride my bike all those places. Only change is that I will be among vehicle traffic, blocking the cars because I cant go as fast.\nWithout good bike lanes, I can't commute safely. Many cyclists in my city are injured or killed every year by unsafe drivers, because we don't have enough cycling infrastructure as it is.\nPlease, don't put me (and many others like me) back to cycling among the traffic. It will increase frustration for drivers and worsen danger for cyclists. We don't need more red tape. Bike lanes clear the way for everyone!\n"

        "comment": "This is a terrible idea, driven purely by culture war politics of a certain group of drivers thinking they are superior, and the Premier's vendetta against Toronto.\nIt claims to be about reducing congestion. We have decades of data all over the world showing the opposite will happen. More people can move faster in bike lanes or on transit than in cars, because the amount of space required per person is much smaller. When Premier Ford sees somebody on a bike, he should imagine how much worse congestion would be if all those people had to be in cars instead, or even on their bikes but required to take up an entire car lane instead of a smaller bike lane. If nothing else, people using all modes of transport should all be able to agree that less congestion is the goal, and to have less congestion, you need less cars, not more. Premier Ford wants to spend a lot of money making the problem so much worse.\nLet's recap some of the other reasons why municipalities need to maintain their ability to listen to the experts on how they build cities, rather than being held hostage for the Premier's vendetta.\nSafety: it's very hard to kill somebody with a bike, and it's a lot harder to kill somebody with a car when there's some separation. Under Premier Ford's plan, bikes will have to ride with cars, going slower than cars, so drivers will be frustrated that they have to share the road and will occasionally take out that frustration on the vulnerable cyclist in front of them. Even if it isn't a matter of frustration, it only takes a short lapse in attention to kill somebody when cyclists are expected to be on the road.\nHealth: biking (or even walking between transit stops) means more exercise, more fresh air, and less pollution. And in places with public health care, better public health means less costs to the system.\nAccessibility: not everyone can bike, or take transit, but not everyone can drive either, including children. If you want the rest of us to be able to leave our houses, we need safe ways to use multiple options.\nPublic maintenance costs: cars damage roads really fast, requiring lots of repairs. Along with being expensive, more construction means even more congestion. This is only getting worse as cars are getting much heavier in recent years. Roads can withstand the much lower weight of bikes (or one bus instead of 50 cars) for a lot longer, saving large amounts of public money.\nPersonal costs: cars are expensive personally, too. The last data I saw said $15,000 CAD per year, or about 15% of an average household income. My bike costs me maybe $200 a year on some maintenance, after about $1500 upfront a few years ago. A public transit pass here would be about $1000 per year, or I could pay per trip if you don't need a lot. For a man who is constantly saying he cares about affordability, it is very disappointing to see him demand that everybody devote that much money to a car.\nSocial interaction: cars are fundamentally isolating, buffering human interactions. Bike paths and on transit you see faces and occasionally talk to each other. Please stop taking away opportunities to freely interact with other people. We desperately need that.\nEnvironmental damage: personal transportation is a substantial part of Ontario's contribution to climate change. EVs are slowly cutting that. Reliable bike or transit cuts it much more. If we don't cut back to less cars (which again, also means less congestion), we are dooming ourselves to much worse pain than having to see somebody on a bike.\nPracticality of this review process: can a few provincial officials really review every bike lane in every city in the province, which has already gone through years of analyzing data, proposing the best solution, and convincing politicians who are usually like Premier Ford only able to imagine life inside a metal box? I assume they know the answer is no, and the real point is to stop municipalities from even trying. That is remarkably disingenuous.\n"

        "comment": "This is one of the most misguided pieces of legislature that I have ever seen. We have an absolute CRISIS LEVEL budgetary backlog in our city that is caused by us having too many vehicular travel lanes. We are ONE BILLION DOLLARS behind in our maintenance and upkeep for municipal infrastructure and the biggest budget item is roads. The last thing we need is a law that prevents our municipality from converting extraneous traffic lanes to alternative, lower impact uses. In addition, Ontario's major cities are facing a public health crisis of maimed and killed cyclists because we are decades behind the rest of the developed world when it comes to building safe infrastructure for people on bikes and on mobility devices. Passing this law puts the blood of future dead cyclists and e-mobility device users on the hands of the party members who vote this in. My question for lawmakers: What will you say to your own family when you rip out a bike land and a cyclist later dies on the road you made less safe? And finally - bike lanes are not about slowing down cars, it's about our FREEDOM as Canadians to choose how we want to get around our cities. Stop taking the freedom of choice away. We need to build every road so that ALL modes of transportation are a viable and safe choice.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are a municipal concern, not a provincial one. This is not a province wide issue, it varies from city to city and town to town. They also don't impede traffic and in fact reduce congestion as their absence means cyclists have to drive within automobile lanes, which is slowed to the speed of the cyclist where passing is not available.\nMaking this a provincial concern is a prime example of government overreach, and it will create more problems than it could solve.\n"

If the goal was really to reduce gridlock, you would invest more in public transportation and aim to reduce the number of cars on the road.

        "comment": "I write to express my unequivocal and adamant opposition to the Highway 403 expansion proposal and the reckless removal of bike lanes. The expansion of Highway 403 is not only misguided but a deeply irresponsible policy that defies all known evidence on the dangers of induced demand. This is not a debate; it is a settled fact that building more roads only attracts more cars, leading to greater congestion, higher emissions, and irreversible environmental harm. In pushing for this, the government is willfully ignoring decades of research from experts who have repeatedly proven that such expansions solve nothing, only ensuring our cities remain choked by traffic and pollution. This policy represents the worst kind of short-term, myopic thinking that will leave lasting scars on our communities.\nEqually abhorrent is the proposal to remove bike lanes, a move that flies in the face of well-established facts on the benefits of cycling infrastructure. Study after study has demonstrated that bike lanes reduce traffic, improve public health, and contribute to safer roads. To remove these lanes in favor of car-dominated streets is a regressive, dangerous step backward. It is unconscionable that in 2024, when the world is moving towards greener, more sustainable transport options, Ontario would even consider dismantling vital cycling infrastructure. Such a policy will worsen traffic, degrade the quality of life, and ensure we remain tethered to outdated, harmful systems. I urge you, in the strongest possible terms, to abandon this misguided, incompetent, and damaging proposal.\n"
