        "comment": "This bill is absolutely ridiculous. First of all, adding more red tape and bureaucracy is useless to the Conservatives who should be pushing for smaller government interference, especially within CITIES. I use cycle lanes whenever I can because they provide safe, separated infrastructure to cars who seemingly care less and less about others on the road. Furthermore, when I'm driving I want to avoid cyclists whenever I can, just as I would not want to deal with people walking on the road. The planning behind this bill completely ignores those who do not currently bike but would if cycling infrastructure was improved. This is a sad progression of this provincial government when important issues like financial stability and house prices loom over us.\n"

        "comment": "Local transportation is a matter for local governments to decide on as they understand the context best, have access to the most evidence, and are most responsive to local residents and their preferences. The recently installed bike lanes in Toronto received overwhelming majorities of votes at city council. There are no secondary roads that would be suitable for replacing the Yonge bike lanes as there are no such roads that extend any significant portion of the distance between Bloor and Eglinton anywhere near Yonge Street. This means that there would be no suitable alternative that would keep cyclists safe trying to get from downtown to midtown Toronto, or to Bike Share riders to make connections with the subway.\n"

The worst way to deal with increasing automobile traffic is to increase the number of paved streets and lanes for automobiles. After a short moment of relief the situation will remain: We do not have enough space for all the street surface and parking we need to accommodate all the people who want to drive their car in Toronto. Unless we start getting rid of housing, and we all agree that is the wrong move. Removing bike lanes is the wrong move.\n"

        "comment": "Please please please refer to the copious amounts of research that point to bike lanes helping EASE congestion!   All around the world, world class cities like Paris, Montreal, Copenhagen, Tokyo\nAs a lifelong cyclist and downtown Toronto resident, I use the bike lanes on a daily basis. I don't feel safe riding on roads with no designated bike lanes. Cars and trucks driving downtown have become increasingly aggressive towards cyclists sharing the open roads with them. Perhaps this is due to the fact that the drivers are stuck in traffic. As a person who also drives occasionally, I would feel more at ease if cyclists had their own designated lane, for constant fear of hitting them. Knowing there are safe bike lanes to travel along, I will always opt to cycle over driving because as it stands, it's faster, free, more environmentally friendly and better for my health. As a cyclist I am more prone to stopping at local shops along my commutes, as finding parking is not a hassle.  I know many people who do not cycle because of the treacherous roads and traffic that they'd have to endure, so instead, they are ordering Ubers and Lyfts, that are clogging up our streets. These young professionals are also choosing not to take transit, as the TTC has been deteriorating due to lack of funding. Transit times are horrendous, sometimes taking twice as long then biking or driving. Why not use the money that you would spend on ripping up perfectly good bike lanes, and putting in wider roads, that would only encourage more drivers to jam up the streets, and put it into funding improved transit systems?\nThe Bike Share program has been growing over the past few years, which indicates more folks are looking for car alternatives. Many folks who rent these bikes do not wear helmets, asking them to ride on the street alongside cars is a disaster waiting to happen. Please keep our citizens safe, as they try to make the right decisions.\n"

        "comment": "Hi, I support bike lanes.\nWe know from evidence that bike lanes help to:\n- reduce gridlock\n- reduce greenhouse gases\n- gets more people to move through the same amount of space\n- supports local businesses\n- encourages active living while promoting health and wellbeing\nBike lanes are not just a matter of convenience; they are vital for many residents who rely on affordable transportation options. Children, teens, older adults, people that have disabilities, and or can\u2019t afford or want a vehicle that makes up a large part of our population also need to get around. Motor vehicles are only one option to get around and it takes up a lot of space compared to how many people it's transporting.There is a need for equitable, accessible alternatives like cycling infrastructure.\nTraffic congestion is self-perpetuating. More cars on the road lead to more traffic. Expanding bike lanes offers an opportunity to break this cycle by encouraging more people to use alternative modes of transport, thereby reducing overall congestion and improving the flow of traffic for everyone. Increasing the number of cars on the road will lead to more pollution, injuries and deaths. The World Health Organization \u2013 Global Status Report Road Safety 2023, shows that the leading cause of death to those aged 5 - 29 are road injuries.\nInvesting in safe, accessible bike infrastructure is essential for the health, safety, and well-being of our communities, as well as for addressing the city\u2019s pressing environmental and transportation challenges.\nDo not add red tape to building bike lanes as this will slow down vital infrastructure that will save lives. I use bike lanes every day and consider them essential infrastructure like sidewalks. We need to think about guaranteeing safety and providing options for vulnerable road users instead of maximizing the number of cars on the road. When I drive, I rather cyclists be out of my way and in their own bike lane for everyone's safety. Bike lanes support transit investments by making it easier to get to transit stations.\nThese actions are not only distractions from the real needs of our city but also betray a lack of vision and leadership when it comes to addressing urban challenges. Bike lanes are a practical, immediate step that can provide tangible benefits for city residents, but we need all levels of government working together to make them a reality.\nThere are best practices that municipalities are learning from and trying to achieve, why are we wasting resources going backwards? They will 100% compromise cyclists' and pedestrians' safety until safe infrastructure is put in place.\nIt is status quo bias to think it\u2019s unfair to take away space from cars when we fail to provide infrastructure to other types of mobility modes.\nI support safe bike infrastructure! Do not remove the current ones. It has taken decades to get what we have and it will take longer to build out our full network to see the benefits.\n"

Additionally, having separated bike lanes is not only better for cyclists, who benefit from increased safety, but also for drivers, since cyclists will be out of their way, instead of being in car lanes, holding up traffic. Having good, safe cycling infrastructure supplements and supports public transit use, and provides people with more choice and flexibility in how they get around.\n"

        "comment": "The construction of these bike lanes has barely been completed and the province is proposing to tear out?  This is a waste of money and without any data collection or statistics to justify this decision.  The bike lanes have not been in place long enough to establish their impact on traffic or their long-term usage.  The justification of the bike lanes in the first place was based on studies on usage, traffic impact, etc.  Where is the review of this research to show if or how it is flawed?  At the very least, it is an opportunity to learn to not repeat same mistake.\nI am both a bike rider and car driver and am sympathetic to people stuck in traffic.  I have also ridden my bike in Toronto well before there were bike lanes.  The current bike lanes makes biking vastly better than before.\nI am not convinced that bike lanes are a primary cause for traffic.  As others have pointed out, there are no bike lanes on the highways.  There are other solutions that can be explored.  For example, no street parking on main roads anywhere that it would block a lane for traffic.  Technology such as FSD cars and automated public transit should also reduced traffic within the next decade.\nLast point is that total cost of ownership of a car is unaffordable for many.  Bikes, ebikes, and scooters (all users of bike paths) allow more people to afford to be mobile.\n"

Increasing the bike infrastructure, as well as investing in public transit are things that reduce traffic congestion, whereas adding lanes increases congestion via induced demand. This bill is terrible and will cause myself and others to vote against Doug Ford.\n"

People commute on bikes for many different reasons, whether it be for the convenience, the affordability, the environment, and more.\nTo remove decades worth of safe bike infrastructure and development is extremely disheartening and looks to me like a big step back on increasing Toronto's mobility. Car congestion is an issue, however it is in Ontario's better interest to develop alternative transportation infrastructure (e.g. bike lanes, streetcars, subways, busses) to fix this problem. More traffic lanes for personal vehicles will not solve the congestion problem and the lack of accessible parking problems in Toronto.\nThe removal of key sections of bike lanes on Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue will only set us back, when ridership on these bike lanes have only increased year by year.\n"

I share a car with my wife but I choose to cycle as it's a more efficient and pleasent way to get around the core, and me cycling means one less car on the road.\nI urge you to reconsider the provisions in Bill 212 and work with municipalities to expand, not restrict, Ontario\u2019s cycling infrastructure. These bike lanes are more than just paint on the road\u2014they are a critical part of building a sustainable, safe, and prosperous future for all Ontarians.\n"

This bill seems to be the result of one man's disdain seeing bikes on his regular commute.\n"
