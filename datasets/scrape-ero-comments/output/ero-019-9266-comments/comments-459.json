Bill 212 is a major overstep by the provincial government on decisions that should be left to individual municipalities. It also seems to directly disagree with the Ford government position on less red tape and government interference in Ontarions lives.\n"

        "comment": "As someone who is not a cyclist, I have learned from multiple studies and from visiting foreign cities that have good bike and public transit infrastructure, that removing Bike lanes (and as such options for transit) is not the way to 'save time' as a city.\nNotably, studies on the topic of traffic have determined that adding additional lanes for cars does not actually improve the number of cars that go through an intersection per hour, and as such does not improve traffic/gridlock, or transit speed for cars.\nthe best way to go about reducing traffic is to offer alternatives to cars for commuting.\nby removing bike lanes you are only incentivizing more cars on the road, and making traffic worse for those who still use cars.\nPlease do some research on the topic from countries and areas that use alternatives to car as a more primary form of transportation. Adding lanes does not reduce congestion, it induces demand for cars, and creates more congestion. Maximizing cars on the road does not improve commute times.\nif Conservatives are supposed to be the 'common sense' party, then why are you wasting money removing infrastructure that we already spent millions on creating (not even that long ago). The provincial government should not be adding red tape and bureaucracy to slow down local governments  trying to add transportation options.\nWe need to think about the safety of cyclists, in cities in The Netherlands I could very easily see myself using a bike daily to commute, however in the current state of our cities in Canada, It is a necessity to bike on routes that are shared with cars. and I do not feel comfortable biking in this scenario.\nNot only this, when I drive I would much rather have cyclists out of the way, and not forced to be on the same road as cars, not only is this annoying, but unsafe.\nIf we want Ontarians quality of life to improve, via having more disposable income, forcing all Ontarians to own a car is not the way to do this. Cars are expensive, and most people who live in a city, would not own one if they didn't have to. Removing bikes as an alternative form of transportation is further forcing Canadians to own a car. This is exacerbated by the fact that most cities in Canada have poor alternatives to driving, due to the underfunding of public transit options, and cycling infrastructure.\nDon't make traffic worse by forcing people to own cars to get anywhere efficiently. PLEASE.\nextra lanes attract more drivers, which will not solve the problem long term.\n"

        "comment": "I dont understand how this is has been proposed as a solution when its never worked in the past. How i know this is because we are here right in 2024 and this is a supposed answer to the gridlock in mississauga. Roads were being built since the inception of this city and as the population grows over time so will the amount of cars on the road. The solution being more roads is frankly insanity, and it's the reason we are having this dilemma in the first place. This will only continue to grow and become more of an issue because we don't have alternate mode of transit.\nToronto, Montreal, Vancouver, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Taipei. What is the commonality with all these cities? They are home to millions of people, are economic boons to the country and they all have various modes of transit, which makes the city busy and people are able to traverse from one end to the other with ease because cars are NOT the only option. Mississauga is decades behind Toronto for this very reason, as the population grows more and more congestion and quality of life will get worse because everyone needs a car to travel intercity nevermind intracity. AS the saying goes \"there's nothing more permanent than a temporary fix\". The paving of more roads being the bandaid solution in place of more intuative modes of transit are what keeps mississauga and the GTA in the past.\nIn short, I don't support this is any capacity. And since you clearly have time and funding, you should use it to come with NEW solutions instead of the same old tricks that have been run into the ground time and time again. Do something different. Bike lanes on main roads that people use to go to places they want to go without having to use a car and get stuck in traffic? If you want to address congestion, instead of doing things that make you feel better, how about trying solutions that actually work. Again we have plenty of cities on this blue planet that we can draw inspiration from.\nThis rat race your running isn't sustainable. The urban sprawl Mississauga is designed after is financially unsustainable. Longer roads just mean more upkeep, more roads just mean even more upkeep, and the the taxpayer is supposed to cover this? The city has to grow to cover the cost but more growth means more cost to cover, it's a dog chasing its own tail. You speak of building another highway, for what? To make up for the absolute blunder that was leasing the 407 for 99 years? This is a huge waste of time and tax payer money to fund a man's delusions of supposed solutions.\n"

        "comment": "Gridlock is a problem caused by too many cars, not too many bikes. There are many other solutions simply look around the globe. Making more space for care simply invites more cars into that space. Look at the 401- more lanes, more cars. Reducing gridlock and the accompanying need to park all of these cars does not improve with taking bike lanes away. Might as well get rid of the street cars too, and the buses if you only want cars to use these roads. This is a car centric legislation that fails to provide access to those other than car users.\n"

        "comment": "The provincial government through Bill 212 is overstepping its boundaries into what is a solidy municipal matter. This is not welcome in our communities where residents and local councils should have the final say on municipal infrastructure.\nRemoving bike lanes, adding red tape and regulations to installing new ones will cause more traffic, more frustration in sharing the road, and frankly more fatalities for cyclists.\nFinally the proposal to reroute Bloor and University Ave bike lanes through side roads is absurd. First, no such routes exist without zigzagging through residential areas. Second why not encourage cars to use these routes if it'll reduce traffic? Because it will not.\nThis is all coming from a rural Ontario resident (Kawartha Lakes). So I hope it speaks volumes that even I care and am following this closely.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is utterly ridiculous, please don't do this. The growth of Toronto's downtown cycling network has been such a wonderful thing to see. With space being at such a premium in the downtown area, many people don't even own a car and rely on the cycling networks as a great supplement to the TTC as a way to get around the city. So much of the city is already taken up by car infrastructure, the fact that we have just 3 bike lanes on key roads for navigating the city, but that's already too much for Doug Ford is so telling of his fundamental opposition to cycling as a means of transportation without even being willing to listen to reasoned opposition.  Stop the power grab, the sooner we get rid of Doug Ford, the better.\n"

Adding more lanes for cars, means more cars on the road, leading to more congested roads. There might be a lag of 1-2 years but then car traffic will be worse than it was before the removal of the bike lanes. Adding lanes for cars is extremely short-sighted.\n12 cyclists can fit in the space occupied by one car. Bikes are less destructive to road surfaces, quieter, and cleaner. The only way to keep Toronto moving efficiently is by investing in cycling.\n"

This is not the time to start tearing up bike lanes and pushing the car as the ultimate form of transportation.\nMunicipal governments should retain the right to make decisions on bike lanes. It is simply wrong for the government to take this right away. How does the provincial government claim to know more about local transportation than the municipality?\nI commuted to work by bike for fifteen years. Riding through downtown always felt a bit like taking your life in your hands. The eventual addition of bike lanes through downtown made that journey feel much safer.  For the safety and health of our communities and for the environment, we need more bike lanes, not fewer.\nI am 100% opposed to the proposed legislation. Take the money that would be wasted tearing up existing infrastructure and invest it in health care and housing.\n"

        "comment": "These Toronto bike lanes are very important for cyclist safety, and for encouraging more people to commute and travel by bike (which would then reduce the number of cars on the road and thereby reduce car traffic). Therefore, I disagree with the removal of these bike lanes.\nI am also a daily bike rider, who commutes daily from North York to Downtown Toronto for my work, and I utilize bike lanes everyday to keep me safe.\nOur city and province will become a much more pleasant place to live in when we are able to value all forms of transportation. Automobile transportation is highly valued, and will continue to be highly valued while biking infrastructure is being built. Automobile travel speed might be reduced as we improve other forms of transportation infrastructure, but that should not be something that causes such a dramatic reaction.\nI hope the government can consider these comments, and reverse its initiative to remove bike lanes. I also hope that the government can be supportive (rather than obstructive) to the expansion of cycling as a form of transportation.\n"

Driving in Toronto has been a nightmare for years, and it's been getting worse. The planet is on fire. And somehow the answer is to remove the healthy, free, environmental option for people, and encourage them to get back into a car or to pack onto the increasingly unridable TTC?\nAt the very least, a leader should be able to show some studies proving his claim that removing bike lanes will actually solve the problem he's trying to solve. While he's at that, maybe he can look at models of bike-positive cities around the world and try to have an actual pro-human vision of what Toronto could be like.\nHe won't do either of those things, of course. To whoever is reading this, if you ignore whatever you stand to personally gain from this and think about civilization as a whole, at what the best version of our species could look like, is this plan a step towards that, or some nonsense grasp of a reality that doesn't exist?\n"
