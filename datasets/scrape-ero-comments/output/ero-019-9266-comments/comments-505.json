I am an Etobicoke resident.\nWhen the City of Toronto\u2019s public transit network, specifically its subway and LRT network, becomes much more robust that may be the time to permit bike lanes on major thoroughfares.\nAt present, bike lanes deter patrons of local businesses, result in periods of gridlock, result in extremely confusing traffic controls for drivers, pedestrians and cyclists,  and impede emergency vehicles.  I suspect that cordon counts will reveal that the bike lanes are not frequently used.  They were established prematurely.\nI do support safe cycling and would hope that the Bill will result in the city considering safer cycling measures on side streets and in parkland adjacent to major thoroughfares.\n"

        "comment": "I disagree with this bill and the removal of bike lanes for multiple reasons:\n1. It will be expensive to remove the bike lanes.\n2. Bikes are much smaller and move people much more efficiently, if you remove the bike lanes all of those people using them will have to drive which will increase gridlock.\n3. This is a provincial government overreach into something that should be a municipal concern that just adds unnecessary red tape slowing down progress, and creates additional work for government employees when they could be doing other things.\n4. Bikes are a very environmentally friendly, with the climate crisis we should be doing everything we can to reduce emissions (and not go backwards).\n5. When we see low bike usage compared to cars we need to remember that we have decades and billions (maybe even trillions) of dollars of infrastructure built specifically for cars. We are just starting to get our biking infrastructure started and it is incomplete. A person would be much less likely to dive if their road suddenly stopped, so we need to understand the context of low bike usage, we need more biking infrastructure not less.\nThank you for your time.\n"

        "comment": "The provincial government should not be adding red tape and bureaucracy to prevent municipal governments from being able to develop traffic infrastructure how they see fit.\nBike lanes are an essential part of our infrastructure for preventing gridlock, particularly in current day where population density is so high and our roads do not have the capacity for everyone to be travelling by car. We need to be prioritizing availability of public transportation, walkability, and safe bicycling infrastructure to remedy this problem. These are all options where higher volumes of people can be transported using much less surface area of the roads.\nSurveys have indicated that many more people in Toronto would be regularly choosing bicycles as their form of transportation if we had a safer, more connected network of bike lanes than we currently do. The people wish to have the option of biking, however do not feel that the infrastructure is safe enough yet for them to do so.\nIf we were to expand rather than restrict our network of bike lanes, much of the urban populace would switch from driving to cycling when possible. This would have an alleviating effect on traffic congestion, fossil fuel emissions, and air pollution. This would also have a positive effect on public health due to increasing commuters\u2019 physical activity.\nThe freedom to safely ride one\u2019s bike should not be a partisan issue. Learning how to ride a bike is a cherished part of growing up for so many people. Riding a bicycle is not merely a method of transportation, but a low-cost, high-quality activity wherein the rider is able to exercise while taking in and appreciating their surroundings, thus improving their enjoyment of life. Our cities should be places where children, families, and individuals are able to ride their bikes in the street safely \u2013 and a robust network of bike lanes is crucial to enabling this reality.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly disagree with this proposed legislation. I am someone that occasionally cycles to work in Ottawa and around the city for leisure and I rely heavily on safe bike lanes. I prefer cycling in the summer as it is a way to get exercise while getting to my destination, and is a cheap and easy way to get around the city when there is increased congestion from vehicles. However, I was hit by a car once while biking on the road and while not seriously injured, I was extremely shaken up and have been nervous ever since to ride my bike in an area that isn\u2019t a multi-use pathway or a protected bike lane. If these lanes did not exist, I would not ride my bike, it is as simple as that. This is not an uncommon experience.\nFurther, research shows that the way to reduce traffic is not to build more roads and lanes and highways, but to provide alternate modes of transportation that are reliable and safe. This includes not only bike lanes (that should be protected) but public transportation. Countless traffic studies and research show that when you build more lanes of roads, traffic actually increases because more people think they should be driving, thereby adding more cars to the roads. However, when you provide alternative modes of transportation that people can trust and feel safe using, they will use those instead of driving, thereby reducing traffic. Not to mention the environmental benefits of taking more cars off the road, and the physical benefits of people using active transportation.\nThe province is overreaching in their powers to step into municipalities and require them to remove existing bike lanes that have been carefully planned and gone through many stages of approvals at the municipal level. The province should be focusing on improving the provincial public transportation and perhaps even providing funding to municipalities to improve their public transportation and building more and safer bike lanes. This legislation is not the solution to reducing traffic congestion, and will in fact achieve the opposite of its goal and increase traffic, while also increasing cyclist accidents and deaths. It is an irresponsible, regressive piece of legislation that has no place in Ontario in this day and age. I strongly recommend that this legislation does not move forward and is instead revised to improve active and public transportation.\n"

Cars and construction cause traffic, not bike lanes. The safety of residents who choose to ride bikes are important.\n"

        "comment": "Reducing gridlock to help individuals and business save time is an admirable goal, but Bill 212 does not do this.\nRequiring Ministry approval of bike lanes in municipalities creates unnecessary bureaucracy and unnecessary work for the Ministry, and consequently is a waste of taxpayer money. The municipality is in the best position to decide whether and how to implement bicycle lanes.\nFurther, providing a review process by the Ministry to remove existing bicycle lanes also creates unnecessary bureaucracy and unnecessary work for the Ministry, and consequently is a waste of taxpayer money.\nSuch a review process could also lead to the absurd result where bicycle lanes that have already been put in place by the municipality, which is in the best position to decide whether and how to implement bicycle lanes, are removed against the municipality's wishes. This removal is a waste of taxpayer money, and such an outcome also turns the successful installation of existing bicycle lanes into potential wastes of taxpayer money.\nThis process, in addition to being a waste of money, is likely to result in making gridlock worse, not better.\nUnder the Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O. 1990, Chapter H.8, \u201cvehicle\u201d includes a motor vehicle, trailer, traction engine, farm tractor, road-building machine, bicycle and any vehicle drawn, propelled or driven by any kind of power, including muscular power, but does not include a motorized snow vehicle or a street car; \u201cdriver\u201d means a person who drives a vehicle on a highway; and \u201chighway\u201d includes a common and public highway, street, avenue, parkway,\n driveway, square, place, bridge, viaduct or trestle, any part of which\nis intended for or used by the general public for the passage of\nvehicles and includes the area between the lateral property lines\nthereof.\nFrom this, it follows that cyclists, except where specifically specified in the Act, have thes same rights and responsibilities as motorists. This means that, in the absence of bike lanes, bicycles have the right to occupy an entire lane of traffic.\nNow, it is true that in some instances, such as motorists passing bicycles, regular lanes of traffic are shared.\n(Every person in charge of a vehicle on a highway meeting a person\ntravelling on a bicycle shall allow the cyclist sufficient room on the\nroadway to pass.\u00a0 R.S.O. 1990, c.\u00a0H.8, s.\u00a0148 (4).\nEvery person on a bicycle or motor assisted bicycle who is overtaken by a vehicle or equestrian travelling at a greater speed shall turn out to the right and allow the vehicle or equestrian to pass and the vehicle or equestrian overtaking shall turn out to the left so far as may be necessary to avoid a collision.  R.S.O. 1990, c. H.8, s. 148 (6).)\nHowever, the minimum safe distance for a motor vehicle passing a bicycle is one metre.\n(Every person in charge of a motor vehicle on a highway who is overtaking a person travelling on a bicycle shall, as nearly as may be practicable, leave a distance of not less than one metre between the bicycle and the motor vehicle and shall maintain that distance until safely past the bicycle. 2015, c. 14, s. 42.)\nIn dense urban environments, where bike lanes are most likely to be implemented by municipalities, it is almost never possible for a motor vehicle to safely pass a bicycle with these specific exceptions.\nTherefore, bicycles have the right to occupy an entire lane of traffic, and in most cases the only way for a motor vehicle to pass that bicycle is by changing lanes, as it would for any other motor vehicle.\nBy removing bike lanes, you are not creating space for more cars. You are dedicating more road space to cyclists exercise their rights as drivers. Motorists who do not respect the rights of cyclists as drivers of vehicles as prescribed by the Highway Traffic Act are are in violation of the same.\nFinally, and as should be unsurprising considering the foregoing, there are numerous studies that show the installation of bike lanes actually decreases travel time for motorists. Further, bike lanes lead to an increase in bike usage and consequently a decrease in car usage (one cyclist is potentially one fewer cars on the road). See, e.g., FLOW Project (2016). The Role of Walking and Cycling in Reducing Congestion: A Portfolio of Measures. Brussels. Available at http://www.h2020-flow.eu.\nI repeat myself: reducing gridlock to help individuals and business save time is an admirable goal, but Bill 212 does not do this. The proposed processes around bike lane approval, review, and potential removal, will not improve gridlock and in fact are likely to make it worse. If motorists are frustrated with cyclists, the answer is more cycling infrastructure to keep them safely separated, not less.\nThank you.\n"

        "comment": "As a commuter who uses transit, bikes and also has a car and lives in the west end of Toronto, if the bike lane system is reduced I will be forced into a position to have to drive into the downtown core as part of my commute instead of biking for 3/4 seasons. This means one additional car on the road and I know there are many others like me. This increased congestion will not be reduced by 'one more lane' of traffic. Bikes take up far less space on the road than cars do and are more efficient.\nAs both a driver of a car and a biker, forcing bikers to bike between lanes of cars is not safe for anyone, making driving less comfortable and biking far less safe.\nAs a tax payer both municipally and provincially, wasting money to demolish bike lanes that were recently build by the city is such a waste, it makes me think the liberals or NDP were proposing this. We need the Conservative party to stick true to its roots and be FISCALLY CONSERVATIVE, not wasting money on a pissing match with the city.\n"

As someone who has lived in downtown Toronto for 14+ years, the additional installation of bike lanes, specifically on bloor and university has made my commute much easier and safer. It is a much more pleasant experience biking in bike lanes. I am less nervous about being stuck by cars. I am someone who has access to a car but prefers not to use it. Parking is expensive downtown, and often the amount of time that it takes to bike or drive is the same. Biking is often faster because I don't have to worry about parking.\nWhen biking I connect with the world around me, I am more productive at work, I am less angry because of annoying drivers during my commute. I am more likely to spend money on my way home by popping into a store.\nI have been in several bike / car altercations. I was hit by a driver crossing Richmond in the east end. At the time, there were no bike lanes, so drivers didn't seem to be aware of me. I was doored on Bathurst near front st. I was hit near trinity bellwoods. More cycling infrastructure everywhere sets a precedent for driver's awareness of cyclists on the road. Less bike lanes will take away that awareness which will only cause more danger.\nI am also someone who has biked though many winters, bike lanes or no. The installation of new bike lanes has only made me desire to bike more.\nPlease reconsider this proposal to remove the bike lanes on bloor, university and yonge. Instead why don't  you focus on improving our transit system like expediting the opening of the CrossTown LRT. Send the millions of dollars that you are planning to use to remove bike lanes to those projects. Please. There will be less cars on the road if people have other better options.\nThank you for reading. I'm furious about this decision.\n"

As an Ontarian I am ashamed that this current government would lie through its teeth; to propose a car-centric culture while telling the public that these ridiculous principles will address gridlock.\nBill 212 won't reduce gridlock or save motorists time. Motor vehicles cause congestion, not bikes. Despite unfounded claims to the contrary, the evidence shows that bike lanes do not create additional congestion, whereas people switching from bikes to cars does. These plans further lock us into the car-centric planning decisions that lead to congestion in the first place (I truly hope our provincial government understands the basic concept of induced demand).\nThis bill is provincial overreach into municipal decision-making.\nRipping out functional transportation infrastructure is not fiscally responsible, regardless of whether the province pays for it or not. It is still taxpayer dollars you are using for the sole purpose of gaining unfounded votes.\nSome people prefer or need to drive, but many people don't, and in any community at least 30% of people can't drive due to age, ability, or access, and they need real options too.\nUnless our provincial government can address each and every one of these topics with clear, data driven justifications, then you will lose the trust of Ontarians. You've lost it already with many of us who understand transportation principles, and you'll lose it with all other Ontarians once this problem of gridlock continues to exacerbate itself due to your lack of foresight.\n"

Having a safe, separated lane allows me to travel safely and reduces the chance of being hit by a car. Without safe, protected bike lanes, I would choose to drive, which would only increase traffic, and further contribute to gridlock.\nThis bill will do nothing to decrease congestion. Study after study has found that increasing traffic lanes, while temporarily easy traffic, leads to increased demand. That is because more drivers will know that increased capacity exists, and will choose to drive.\nMunicipalities know what is best for their communities. The province should not be overreaching its power into local matters. We don't need more government oversight on local matters that have local, knowledgeable experts on the ground. I urge the province to focus its work on its own spheres of jurisdiction, which are in crisis situations - health care, education, children's services.\nThe climate crisis is not going away. Cyclists are not going away. Bike lanes represent a tiny fraction of roadways. Removing them will not fix our problems. If it did, other streets with gridlock traffic - like King St, like Dupont St, like the Gardiner, would not face traffic issues.\nI urge the premier to consider facts and evidence, rather than using wedge issues to score political points with the party's voter base. Bike lanes save lives. The premier himself said in a TVO interview in 2017:\n\"We have to do everything we can to make sure there\u2019s never a death in the city. One death is way too many when it comes to bicycle riders. We have to make sure that they\u2019re safe.\"\nPremier Ford, six people riding bikes have been killed on Toronto\u2019s streets in 2024 alone\u2014more than in the previous three years combined. Every death is a family\u2019s unbearable loss, and each new tragedy reopens old wounds for those who have already suffered. Premier Ford, please reconsider Bill 212. Our roads should be safe for everyone, not just people driving. Please work with municipalities to implement data-driven solutions that can address both traffic safety and congestion.\n"

These bike lanes are indispensable to my commute, and to running everyday errands and connecting with friends. Biking on unprotected lanes or streets without designated lanes (such as parts of College) is stressful and dangerous. The province should be supporting *more* and *better* bicycle infrastructure, including better maintenance over the winter, rather than spending millions of dollars to remove already-installed infrastructure. The solution to traffic is to make alternatives to car travel more desirable.\nProtected bike lanes may not be necessary throughout all of Bloor, especially beyond the downtown core. Rather than wantonly removing the entire bike lane, a study should be undertaken to determine where the bike lane is utilized and where it is not. Where I live (near Bloor and Ossington), the bike lane is regularly used at all times of day and year. Do not remove the bike lanes!\n"

Widening roads invites more cars and increases traffic. Jane Jacobs proved this back in the 1960s. Let's fund improved public transit with a hefty tax on vehicle permits: such a policy will get everyone moving, and moving safely.\nRelying on science that is counter-intuitive requires political bravery as well as the capacity to reason and examine evidence.

        "comment": "The intention of this legislation to remove existing bike lanes, especially in the City of Toronto, is deeply frustrating and even frightening.\nNumerous independent studies have found that adding new lanes of traffic to address gridlock has a negligible impact on traffic flow. Anyone who has spent time driving in urban areas knows that you can have multiple lanes on a major thoroughfare and if even one lane is obstructed due to a stalled vehicle, the road may as well be a side street. So to contend that restoring a lane for cars while removing a bike lane will consistently improve travel times is a fallacy.\nAside from the practical issues with this legislation, there are obvious concerns over safety. Bike commuters have every right to use major roads as cars do, and removing protected bike lanes will only endanger them. Cyclists will not simply use slower, less direct side streets just because they have new protected lanes, especially if it means getting to their destination more slowly. This will put cyclists back in the same lanes as cars, and so I am deeply afraid that people I love who cycle will be hurt due to this legislation.\nThe bill seems like an empty attempt to cater to voters of car-dependent areas who have an emotional (and not fact-based) reaction to bike lanes in their neighbourhoods. Traffic issues, specifically in Toronto, come down to many variables, especially the ongoing attempts to catch up with years of underinvestment in road maintenance and transit construction. Many projects are happening simultaneously, causing short-term pain for long-term gain. Gridlock in the province can be addressed, but it will be through holistic solutions like public transit and traffic infraction enforcement, and not knee-jerk reactions done as a stunt before an election. If we truly aspire to be the envy of the world, we must look to countries where infrastructure serves everyone, not merely car owners.\n"

That removing bike lanes was worth my child growing up without a father?\nRemoving bike lanes won\u2019t impact congestion, it will only increase accidents involving the most vulnerable road users. I applaud the government for its commitment to improving public transit on the GO lines and the new Ontario line.  Bike lanes are no different.  Focusing on providing alternatives to driving is the only way to truly decrease congestion.\nRoads should not be monopolized by cars and in my experience, the worst congestion is caused when a lane of traffic is take  up by parked cars, not by bike lanes.  I think this act would be better served opening up roadways by preventing cars from parking in the street and blocking an entire lane of traffic.\nAdditionally, I am deeply concerned with the removal of the requirement for environmental assessments for Hwy 413. If the government chooses to go ahead with this project it should not be at the expense of the environment. The government has a regulatory agency has a responsibility to ensure that any construction does not negatively impact the environment and members of the nearby communities.\n"
