        "comment": "Removing bike lanes in Toronto would be a bad idea.  I have been cycling in this city for over thirty years, and I use the bike lanes as much as I can every time I ride.  Over the past three decades I have noticed a substantial change in the way motorists in the city drive.  When it comes to the roads, this is no longer \"Toronto The Good\".  There is a lot more hostility and aggression out there.  I'm sure it's no secret that bike lanes keep everyone safer.  Before the lanes went in, I felt like I was taking my life in my hands every time I got on my bike.  Now I can get to most of the places I want to go to in a dedicated bike lane and it has made my commuting safer and a much more pleasant experience.  My nephews were here from overseas this summer and they used the bike-share stations to get from one end of the city to the other on numerous occasions during their visit.  They absolutely loved the bike lanes as I'm sure many visitors to Toronto do.  Even people from Montreal think the bike lane system in Toronto is terrific, and they have had a fabulous network of bike lanes for decades now.  From every point of view, bike lanes make good sense:  they encourage people to be active, which is good for their health, they encourage less driving which is good for traffic, and the more people that ride instead of drive, the better it is for the environment.  Rather than taking bike lanes away, more should be added as far as I'm concerned.\n"

        "comment": "The Centre for Active Transportation (TCAT) is strongly opposed to Bill 212 and requests that it be withdrawn in its present form. Given that active transportation plays a critical role in creating environmentally and economically sustainable cities, TCAT has a mandate to increase knowledge and evidence about walking and cycling in our city and beyond. This has been the cornerstone activity of TCAT since its inception in 2008.\nThe evidence is clear about why we need more \u2014 not fewer \u2014 bike lanes, especially on major arterial streets where the majority of traffic deaths and serious injuries occur. Bike lanes save lives. Bike lanes are efficient for moving people. Bike lanes help people get to the places they need and want to go. Bike lanes provide transportation options. Bike lanes reduce traffic and greenhouse gas emissions. Bike lanes enhance our health and wellness. The evidence is so clear and the benefits so wide-ranging that jurisdictions worldwide \u2014 from Copenhagen to Paris to Tokyo, not to mention Montreal and Vancouver \u2014 are installing large networks of well-connected, high-quality bike infrastructure.\nContrary to all evidence and common sense, Bill 212 threatens the viability and survival of Ontario's established and planned bike lane networks. As proposed on October 21, 2024, the Bill will curtail the construction of new bike lanes across the province. The addendum released on October 31, 2024, further proposes to remove existing bike lanes on Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue in the City of Toronto and reinstate traffic lanes for motor vehicles.\nBill 212 in its entirety lacks credibility because it proposes to increase the number of cars on the road in its effort to reduce congestion. Building more and bigger highways will only induce demand resulting in more and more motor vehicle traffic. It also displays dismal short-sightedness for the province to invest billions of dollars in transit in Toronto, and then make it easier to drive on roads that have subway lines underneath.\nPrior to Bill 212, one of the most contentious arguments against bike lanes was put forward by merchant associations in North America, especially when bike lanes reduce on-street parking. Until recently, there was very little evidence to either support or unsubstantiate such fears. So, 15 years ago, TCAT established a research program to address this gap.\nOn three occasions between 2009 and 2017, TCAT studied the local economic impacts (positive, negative or neutral) of removing on-street parking to install a bike lane. Ultimately, the findings have disproven the myth that parking is essential to downtown small business, and in fact, have a positive effect by enabling increased foot traffic.\nLike other road users, people on bicycle are trying to get from Point A to Point B using the most direct route. Because so many destinations are concentrated on major streets, this often entails riding on roads where the volume and/or speed of motor vehicle traffic is high. Bloor Street represents a priority east-west bicycle route in Toronto\u2019s Cycling Network plan for many reasons including:\n\u2022\tEven before the installation of the bike lanes, the street was already used by approximately 3,000 people on bicycles per day;\n\u2022\tPrior to the bike lanes, Bloor experienced a high number of collisions involving people on bicycles;\n\u2022\tBloor is one of only a few direct routes that connects the city from end to end and provides important linkages to existing cycling facilities and to many Toronto destinations and neighbourhoods;\n\u2022\tThere are no streetcar tracks and the corridor is served by a subway line;\n\u2022\tIn cities across North America, research has found that extending the bikeway network is associated with a drop in crashes, fatalities and severe injuries for people on bicycles (Pucher & Buehler, 2016);\n\u2022\tIn Toronto, cycle tracks which are adjacent to and physically separated from traffic have been shown to provide the highest safety benefit, with one ninth the risk of injury in comparison to other major streets with parked cars and no cycling infrastructure. (Teschke et al., 2012).\nIn 2009, TCAT published a groundbreaking study, \u201cBike Lanes, On-Street Parking and Business. A Study of Bloor Street in Toronto\u2019s Annex Neighbourhood.\u201d It found that only 10% of customers were driving to Bloor Street in the Bloor Annex downtown neighbourhood and that patrons arriving by foot and bicycle visited the most often and spent the most money per month.\nIn 2010, TCAT\u2019s second study replicated the methodology in Bloor West Village (\u201cBike Lanes, On-Street Parking and Business Year 2 Report: A Study of Bloor Street in Toronto\u2019s Bloor West Village\u201d), another neighbourhood in Toronto in a location further from the downtown, and found similar results: only 20% of customers were driving to shop, and the majority of merchants believed that a bike lane would increase their business.\nIn 2015, because of TCAT\u2019s previous research and expertise on this topic, the Bloor Annex BIA and Korea Town BIA (with matching funding provided by the Metcalf Foundation) commissioned TCAT, in partnership with the University of Toronto, to research the economic impact of a pilot bike lane to be installed on Bloor Street West between Shaw Street and Avenue Road. The methodology, including the survey questions, was developed in consultation with the BIAs.\nIn 2016, City Council approved the implementation of a pilot project to install and evaluate bike lanes on Bloor Street West. Senior staff from both Transportation Services and Economic Development and Culture subsequently reviewed TCAT\u2019s methodology, including the survey questions, and agreed to join the existing study.\nIn 2017, TCAT released the \u201cEconomic Impact Study of Bike Lanes in Toronto\u2019s Bloor Annex and Korea Town Neighbourhoods\u201d, a research report about the economic impacts of the Bloor Street pilot bike lane, as well as the effect on travel patterns and attitudes of visitors and merchants. Using a case-control and pre-post design, over 3,000 visitor and 625 merchant survey responses revealed once again that only 10% are driving to Bloor Street while 90% of customers arrived by foot, bicycle or transit.\nOn November 7, 2017, Toronto City Council approved the Bloor Street West cycle tracks as a permanent installation. The City used five points of evidence (including TCAT\u2019s research) to consider relating to economic impact. Overall, they found that the street is economically healthy and growing. Beyond economic impact data, the City collected extensive before-and-after data to evaluate the performance of the pilot in order to assess the impacts and benefits of the project, including effects on the motoring environment. A few of the City's key findings were:\n1) motor vehicle volume reduced by 16%;\n2) motor vehicle travel times increased by only 2-4 minutes;\n3) minimal impact to motor vehicle volume or travel time on parallel corridors;\n4) the total number of conflicts between all road users decreased by 44; and\n5) 66% of motorists reported feeling more comfortable driving next to cyclists with bike lanes, compared to 14% prior.\nIn 2019, TCAT\u2019s research into the impact of Toronto\u2019s bike lane pilot project on Bloor Street was published in the peer-reviewed Journal of the American Planning Association (JAPA) in an article titled \u201cMeasuring the Local Economic Impacts of Replacing On-Street Parking with Bike Lanes\u201c.\nTCAT\u2019s thorough and balanced research provides objective, indisputable, defensible evidence disproving the myth that parking is essential to downtown small business. Equally, this research contributes to the deep body of evidence that bike lanes are an essential component of the transportation system.\nCrucially, this research is just one example amongst many that illustrates the lack of any credible evidence to move forward with Bill 212 in its current form.\nOn a personal note, as a 35-year resident of Toronto, I am proud of the progress this city has made to make our streets safer and more welcoming for people walking and cycling. Like thousands of other Torontonians, I primarily get around on foot or by bike. Bill 212 is a serious threat not only to my way of life, but to my very life and personal safety.\n\u2003\nReferences\nArancibia, D., Farber, S., Savan, B., Verlinden, Y., Smith Lea, N., Allen, J. & Vernich, L.

        "comment": "Honestly who does getting rid of bike lanes benefit? It makes it far more dangerous for both bikers and drivers. Getting rid of bike lanes does not eliminate bikes it just makes it more dangerous to get from one place to another. Think of the thousands of people who rely on biking every day to get to work, school, or do their job as a food delivery person. I think this entire idea is ridiculous. Not to mention the taxpayers dollars to destroy a system that saves lives. Biking is the fastest way to get around the city. Driving is slow, the ttc is slow, traffic is slow. When I\u2019m biking I can find myself passing 2 or 3 street cars before getting to where I need to be. So, for all of these reasons, biking is essential, and keeping bike lanes available is going to help save the lives of thousands of Torontonians.\n"

        "comment": "Please do not destroy bike lanes. It will only reduce the variety of transportation people can choose. If this legislation goes through, Ontario and its municipalities will be disgraced, and cyclists on the road will face immense danger due to angry and/or impatient drivers who often display a pattern of disrespect towards cyclists. More traffic lanes will not solve gridlock problems. More opportunities for public and car-alternative transportation methods, however, will. When we have less cars on the road, people will get where they need to be WHEN they need to be. Cyclists deserve respect, and for Ontario to decide to rip up the only lane on the road designated to keep them safe, the government is saying they are not worthy of this respect, and that their lives are worthless. You are telling people that a cyclist's life is not as precious as people are getting to places on time in a car. Please do not let this legislation go through; the future will hold in you in contempt as glaciers continue to melt due to the increase in greenhouse gas emissions, which are only exacerbated by personal vehicular transportation (read link to website below for more information). There is nothing wrong with driving a car, but to make it the supreme, primary, and default method of transportation to the point where the province has decided to rip up bike lanes and is demoting alternate forms of transportation -- putting lives at risk -- is dangerous and disgusting.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly disagree with this plan. As a resident of Toronto who lives on Bloor st and is a driver and cyclist, who also regularly uses the Bloor bike lane, I find it appalling that the government would try to spend my tax payer money to remove the bike lanes. Who will be paying for the removal and the added amount of time and congestion the construction will cause? We should be considering complete streets and active transportation, not perpetuating car forward streets. Maybe work on our subway system and not privatizing the 407 before considering removing bike lanes. I know many residents feel this way. If people are considering this based on costs alone, it will be an expensive endeavour and those funds can be used to improve transportation in other ways.\n"

        "comment": "YOUR BILL IS BAD AND YOU SHOULD FEEL BAD.\nThis will set Toronto's cycling paths BACK at least a decade, destroying improvements that have already been made to the cycling network. Not only that, but Doug Ford is ACTIVELY, WILLFULLY putting the lives of cyclists AT RISK by removing these.\nIt's akin to removing sidewalks to create more street parking. People have a right to freely move about the city in ways that are SAFE, AFFORDABLE, and NON-POLLUTING.\nIN A recent case a 58-year old grandmother who was killed at the corner of Bloor and St George. She was cycling, making a left, and was flattened by a flat-bed truck who was also making a right. A protected corner was subsequently added to the bike lane at that location.\nMunicipalities, and NOT the province, should make decisions on what kind of bike lanes or road usage they require.\nCyclists are people and they are MORE VULNERABLE than cars and need to be considered as such. Our laws need to center the health and safety of its people, not the effeciency and convenience of cars.\n"

        "comment": "I do not support building Highway 413. Alternative solutions for long-distance travel and commuting should be explored to reducing traffic, such as subsidizing tolls on Highway 407 or investing in alternative modes of transport such as transit systems. Canada is committed to a net zero target of 2050, and the fastest way for Ontario to do its part to meet this target is to invest in existing infrastructure and electrifying public transit systems.\nI do not support removing bike lanes in Toronto and I do not support municipalities being required to seek provincial approval for bike lane installation. Removal of these bike lanes will not reduce commuter times in the long term and will initially increase congestion due to construction. Biking in Ontario is much higher than the 1.2% figure previously mentioned by Transport Minister Hon. Prabmeet Sarkaria - 68% of Ontarians ride a bike at least monthly, and 22% of Ontarians ride a bike on a daily basis. And upon installation of bike lanes on Bloor in Toronto, conflicts between all road users went down by 44%, whether between drivers, pedestrians or cyclists, which increased safety for everyone.  Additionally, costs are estimated to be at least $48 million for removal of existing bike lanes. As a taxpayer in Ontario, I will be very disappointed to see our tax dollars go into the removal of existing road infrastructure which was designed with modern safety and traffic standards in mind.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed framework that would enable provincial approval for the removal of bike lanes, including those on Bloor St., Yonge St., and University Ave. in Toronto.\nBike Lanes Save Lives:\nBike lanes provide a safer environment for cyclists, reducing the risk of accidents and fatalities on busy streets. Removing these lanes would endanger the lives of thousands of cyclists who rely on this infrastructure to commute safely.\nEnvironmental Benefits:\nBike lanes are a crucial step toward reducing greenhouse gas emissions. By encouraging more people to choose cycling over driving, they help cities meet climate goals and create a more sustainable future. Removing bike lanes runs counter to these efforts and would increase reliance on cars, leading to higher emissions and poorer air quality.\nHealth Benefits:\nCycling is a great way to promote public health by encouraging physical activity. Bike lanes make cycling a more accessible and attractive option, reducing the burden on our healthcare system by fostering healthier lifestyles.\nTraffic Congestion:\nContrary to misconceptions, bike lanes reduce traffic congestion by providing an alternative mode of transportation, alleviating pressure on roads and public transit systems. Cities worldwide have shown that investing in bike infrastructure leads to fewer cars on the road and smoother traffic flow. Removing these lanes would likely result in more cars and gridlock.\nBoosting Local Businesses:\nStudies have shown that bike-friendly streets boost local businesses, as cyclists are more likely to stop and shop compared to drivers. The removal of bike lanes would harm small businesses that benefit from the increased foot traffic.\nWaste of Taxpayers' Money:\nSignificant public funds were invested in creating these bike lanes. Removing them not only wastes this investment but also incurs additional costs to revert the streets back, with no clear long-term benefit. This is an irresponsible use of taxpayers' money.\nGlobal Precedents and Leadership:\nCities around the world, including Amsterdam, Copenhagen, and New York, are investing in bike infrastructure because of its proven benefits. Ontario should be a leader in promoting sustainable urban development rather than taking a regressive step that undermines safety, health, and economic growth.\nIn summary, this proposal is short-sighted and counterproductive. Instead of removing bike lanes, the focus should be on expanding them to create a safer, healthier, and more sustainable Ontario. I urge the government to reconsider this proposal and prioritize the well-being of its citizens and the environment.\n"

Now, I can drive and park with peace of mind because cyclists are in a different lane. I find myself getting to places faster and don't need to worry about ruining a cyclist's AND MINE day if I accidentally hit someone. Nobody want to get sued for hitting a cyclist.\nIf these protected bike lanes are removed, I feel the congestion will get worse because cyclists will be forced to share the road in precarious ways that make it difficult for drivers.\nIf you want to improve the road for drivers, please keep the bike lanes!\n"
