I will be stopping all voting, support and donations to Lisa and her successor if this goes along.  What a waste of money! My son was telling me there is a LRT that the province has been working on for 15 years and still isn\u2019t ready. Why can\u2019t you put this money into that. Wouldn\u2019t that help with congestion? I am not an expert but surely an LRT system would move more people than a car on Bloor street.  This is embarrassing given the long support I have provided to this party.\n"

The only way to do that is to get cars off the road.\nPlease see sense, look to actual data, and  reconsider this bill.\nSave the bike lanes!\n"

I do not have the capacity to afford a vehicle of my own, and cycling provides me with joy and exercise when I do not have much time to get some otherwise. These lanes save my life when sharing the street with vehicles. Public transit is incredibly busy and less cost effective than cycling. Please reconsider passing this bill! Many people\u2019s lives depend on it. This will not stop people from biking and instead will encourage unsafe sidewalk usage.\n"

Bike lanes are an important part of the city infrastructure. Do not remove them!\n"

We also have a responsibility to ensure that people can bike safely wherever they are, and this requires separate and protective bike lanes, as cars are amongst the biggest threats to cyclists. Also, municipalities should decide what biking infrastructure is best suited for their city - it is silly and unnecessary for the province to step in. Please throw out this bill.\n"

        "comment": "I am concerned about the public health implications of this proposed plan.  As a family physician practicing in downtown  Toronto I counsel Torontonians every day on the need to engage in physical activity to maintain health.  Often time is a barrier and cycling is a way to achieve both efficient transportation and health benefits.  In the absence of bike lanes many people feel unsafe to engage in this.  And the risks are real.  As a palliative care physician I have also taken care of an 18 year old who was struck by a car and died as a result.  We need safe, efficient options for transportation  and that promote and protect health.  Transportation by bicycle is significantly more space efficient than cars If everyone who is on a bike were driving a car this would result in more gridlock and more people biking can help reduce gridlock, but it needs to be safe.  Separated bike lanes have been shown to save live and ultimately safety should be the priority.\n"

        "comment": "I grew up riding my bike in Toronto. I went to school across from castle Frank station. So many students like myself rely on the Bloor bike lane to get to early morning rehearsals on time before the subways run. Biking to school or work is also more reliable than taking the subway most days. If you take the Bloor bike lane away you are putting children\u2019s lives and safety at risk and further burdening the TTC at rush hour. Growing up without a car in a single parent household, I used bike lanes to get to school, practices, rehearsals, part time jobs, friends houses\u2026 if you take away bike lanes you are taking all of that away from Toronto\u2019s youth.\n"

        "comment": "This legislation has come about because of Kingsway and Queensway car drivers upset about bloor and Royal York. You are well overstepping the overstating the impact on the whole city. Bike lanes need a safe network not just in limited areas. No one should be driving in from Brampton and driving down Bloor street. That is a failure of provincial transit and highways. We need better transit and more bike lanes to reduce congestion and you are going in the opposite direction. The Yorkville BIA has said their sales went up after bike lanes went in. This pattern happens all over the world as people are more likely to shop when coming by bike.\n"

        "comment": "I live close to Bloor Street West and see the use of the bike lanes on a daily basis in my neighborhood. Everyday I see people using them, and I also use them.  As a biker and as a pedestrian I feel safer. Unlike some others, I went to the Open House held by my local city counsellor and I heard what is being done to evaluate and continuously improve safety for everyone, as the Bloor Street project is meant to do. The goal is to make the city streets efficient for everyone - drivers, pedestrians and cyclists.  It. Takes time to change the street light timing, and to monitor driver behaviour. The speed limit is 40 and only now is that being achieved. Cars were regularly speeding in past. Emergency vehicles are not impeded in their access as confirmed by the fire department.\nThere are at least 75,000 new accommodation units (condos etc) already approved for this immediate area (Bloor Street West and Royal York Road). Much of that accommodation DO NOT HAVE PARKING SPACES!  We need the infrastructure via bike lanes to give those new residents a safe way to get around!  The status quo is no longer acceptable!\nFinally, provincial money is also my tax dollar. I do not want it spent by wastefully tearing up bike lanes!\n"

        "comment": "This is a nonsense plan that will waste taxpayers dollars and put cyclists at a much greater risk of injury or death. The Bloor bike lane in particular is VERY heavily used by commuters and has become a vital transit artery.\nRecent Improvements to the flow of traffic on Bloor have been made with good planning and signaling. Bloor used to be terribly gridlocked during rush hour and now it is one of the most efficient routes to drive on- despite there being a bike lane in place.\nThis is downtown Toronto\u2019s version of the Greenbelt scandal just waiting to happen. After the science centre and Ontario place the Doug Ford government is proving that they are reckless and corrupt.\n"

        "comment": "In reference to Bill 212 and the removal of bike lanes in the City of Toronto.\nSupporting bike lanes is crucial for promoting sustainable transportation, reducing traffic congestion, and cutting down on greenhouse gas emissions. We have worked hard to create our bike lane infrastructure and removing it would not only set us back in achieving these goals but also compromise the safety of cyclists who rely on them daily. Without dedicated bike lanes, cyclists are forced to share the road with vehicles, significantly increasing the risk of accidents, injuries, and fatalities.\nOther major cities around the world are setting examples by expanding their bike lane networks and reaping the benefits of reduced traffic, cleaner air, and safer streets. Additionally, the cost of removing existing bike lanes is an unnecessary burden on taxpayers, wasting funds that could instead be used to improve infrastructure. Proper funding should be allocated to enhance bike lanes and improve coordination between bike and road traffic.\nIt\u2019s also important to recognize that bike lane infrastructure is a municipal issue, not a provincial one. Cities understand their unique transportation needs and priorities best, and decisions about bike lanes should remain within their control. Bill 212, however, does not support bike lanes and instead opens the door to removing them\u2014undermining the progress we\u2019ve made and putting cyclists at greater risk.\nCity car congestion is a real problem, but bike lanes are not the cause. In fact, bike lanes help reduce congestion by encouraging people to choose alternative transportation, taking cars off the road. Blaming bike lanes for traffic issues distracts from the need to address underlying problems such as poor urban planning, inefficient traffic flow, and reliance on single-occupancy vehicles. Instead of removing bike lanes, we should invest in smarter solutions that create a balance between all modes of transportation, ensuring safer and more efficient streets for everyone.\n"

It was treacherous and I suffered am injury when I fell off my bike avoiding being hit by a left turning car on Bloor Street.\nNow I cycle to work neer High Park and do errands by bike as well. It is only possible to do so given the safety bike lanes on Bloor, and elsewhere, provide. I used to be one of few cyclists.  Now it is impressive to see huge numbers of cyclists commuting to work rather than driving.  Removing them would be a catastrophic step backwards.\n"

        "comment": "Cities are indeed \"creatures of the province,\" so the government of Ontario has the *right* to intervene in Toronto. But *rights* presume the discretion about when & where to use those rights. My neighbour is grateful that, while I have the *right* to operate a jack-hammer from 9-5, 365 days/year, I proceed with discretion and, so far, have never used that right.\nThe city of Toronto developed a broad transportation plan with the widest possible public consultations. I am unclear what else could have been done to include public input.\nIn the meantime, what seems to have generated a backlash, and now a political intervention by the province, is the extension of bike lanes into Etobicoke.\nMy wife and I both bike daily to work along these bike lanes. They have helped to save time, but more importantly the lanes offer us a way to arrive safely at our destinations. Does this come at the expense of motorists? To a degree, of course, but the average time added along the Bloor corridor is measured in single-digit minutes (according to the official statistics), and that is orecisely what I see as I bike along during the morning and afternoon/evening commute. The line of cars is longer than it used to be, but it's not nearly as long as the opponents of bike lanes claim it is. The rest of the car network seems to have absorbed much of the extra traffic.\nIf something was wrong with the rollout of the bikelanes, it wasn't creating the lanes themselves. It was not simultaneously offering a major improvement to public transportation options along the same corridors. The Ontario line will help in some places, but not in Etobicoke. Line 2 and its capillaries need to move beyond 1970s technology and design. With fundamental improvements and a diverse array of transportation options, people will be able to get to and fro as they do in all major cities around the globe.\nIf the Government of Ontario wants Toronto to thrive, it should indeed intervene here, but not by rolling back what the city has developed. Instead, it should intervene by supporting a major expansion of public transit options. Not an incremental, fits-and-starts, subject-to-the-political-tides expansion, but something visionary that will ensure that Toronto remains a world-class city.\n"
