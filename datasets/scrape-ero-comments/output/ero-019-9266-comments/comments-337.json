        "comment": "This makes no sense, and will only lead to:\n1. Increased congestion over multiple years on major streets in Toronto as a result of construction.\n2. Encouraging driven traffic through Toronto rather than public transit or cycling, leading to more emissions.\n3. An increase in the number of deaths and accidents as a result of cyclists being forced to ride on streets with unprotected bike lanes.\n4. An increase in traffic congestion as a result of cars having to navigate around cyclists on streets with unprotected bike lanes.\nThis proposal is backward-thinking and shifts Toronto towards becoming an outdated city. It may help Doug Ford in his election because of how many Ontarians have to commute into Toronto, and are forced to drive because the public transit system is not efficient enough, but this proposal won't even help those citizens in the long-term anyways.\n"

Bike lanes makes it way easier to keep track of bikes when driving downtown with a load. If anything you should add more red turn lights that give cars a chance to make a turn without having to contend with bikes and pedestrians.\n"

I drive and bike in the City of Toronto and this level of intervention in local transit decisions feels like an attack on Toronto residents. The bike lanes mentioned in the bill are vital to Toronto's cycling network. Without it there will be more fatalities and discourage active transportation. The Province should be required to prove that the bike lanes in question are increasing congestion.\n"

I'm sure the money the Province of Ontario would spend on ripping up existing, well-used bike lanes would afford a few doctors. After all, I'm on a two-year waiting list to see a specialist.\nWhen I drive today, these things slow our traffic down:\n- Toronto police not monitoring or stopping unruly/speeding drivers\n- cars parked during rush hour with the four-ways on\n- cars parked on the main streets until 4 pm.\n- lights that don't have the left turn options/aren't on\nA bike lane does not slow me down, and it saves lives.\n"

Six cyclists have already died on Toronto roads this year including one forced out of Bloor St bike lanes. The science proves the lanes help reduce gridlock and help local businesses. They are heavily used and are a huge benefit to our city. The lanes in question are part of a network that these plans hamper. This is an attempt to distract from other government failures. This plan is incredibly short sighted and disappointing. These bike lanes are used increasingly by many commuters.\n"

This proposal will dramatically worsen congestion in Toronto and Ontario by removing the fastest way to get around congested cities.

Why does the province want to ban affordable, congestion-proof transportation like cycling and micromobility?\n"

        "comment": "It is an absurd waste of money to remove pre-existing bike lanes. There is also plenty of literature that indicates how bike lanes help improve congestion. I drive in Toronto, and the lanes have taken cyclists off the actual roads, allowing for a safer drive. If anything adds to the congestion it is the constant construction going on, which I don\u2019t take issue to in itself as it indicates things are growing and being maintained. I will say I have no interest in voting for a politician who wastes time and resources on removing new and existing infrastructure in contradiction of data that, at minimum, provides a compelling argument for bike lanes making a less congested and safer drive in the city. There are many other issues under the provincial purview that need desperate attention, and this non-issue is not one of them. I am sick of watching our services crumble while focus is directed at this nonsense. Do better.\n"

        "comment": "The proposal requiring provincial permission for new bike lanes where motor vehicular lanes will be removed, and the proposal to allow existing bike lanes. to be removed is completely misguided. Leaving aside issues of provincial overreach, this will: 1) set us back as a province in terms of protecting the lives of vulnerable road users, 2) increase motorized vehicle congestion in many areas as people abandon safe cycling routes and get back into their cars, 3) put a damper on the economic benefits of cycle tourism, including in southwest Ontario in light of the potential of the new Gordie Howe Bridge project (which will have dedicated lanes for cyclists and pedestrians), 4) further hamper our ability to combat climate change, 5) deny citizens of this province the ability to engage in a healthy form of activity in a safe manner, and 6) be a poor waste of taxpayer dollars should existing lanes be removed. This is a divisive proposal and the antithesis of evidence-based decision making. Please reconsider.\n"

The city built these bike lanes as they are in demand and they help reduce car use, and gridlock by extension. Preventing additional bike lanes and removing existing ones is a catastrophic error that will damage our city for generations to come.\nThese bike lanes reduce carbon emissions, reduce traffic, improve road safety, improve Toronto's character and lively hood, boost local businesses, and make life more affordable for Torontonians.\nRemoving these lanes a regressive, cynical, and undemocratic decision.\n"

        "comment": "The proposal to remove the recently built bike lane infrastructure is both impractical and counterproductive to the city\u2019s goals of improving traffic flow, promoting safety, and supporting sustainable transportation options. Contrary to assumptions that bike lanes may slow down traffic, studies have shown that well-designed bike lanes can help improve overall traffic efficiency by separating cyclists from cars, reducing the likelihood of unexpected obstacles for drivers, and alleviating congestion in shared lanes. By encouraging alternative modes of transport, bike lanes can actually lead to smoother traffic flow, not slower.\nMoreover, the rise of delivery services has led to a substantial increase in the number of bicycles on the road, with cyclists frequently navigating busy routes to fulfill essential services for residents and businesses. Dedicated bike lanes are essential for these riders, enabling them to carry out their jobs more safely and efficiently. Removing these lanes would force these cyclists back into shared traffic lanes, increasing the risk of accidents and disrupting traffic as delivery bikes attempt to maneuver around cars and pedestrians. The city should be focusing on supporting these delivery riders who contribute to the local economy, not making their jobs more difficult or dangerous.\nRemoving the bike lanes also poses a serious safety risk for pedestrians. Without a dedicated lane, cyclists\u2014especially those trying to avoid high-traffic areas\u2014may turn to sidewalks, leading to overcrowded pedestrian pathways. This creates an unsafe environment where pedestrians, particularly children, seniors, and those with mobility challenges, could be at risk of collisions with bikes. Rather than removing bike lanes, the city should consider ways to expand this infrastructure to support both cyclists and pedestrians, fostering a city where all forms of movement can coexist safely. Investing in safe, dedicated bike lanes is essential for a forward-thinking city that values the well-being of its residents, the economy, and the environment.\n"

        "comment": "I am quite disturbed by another example of provincial government overreach on municipalities, especially when they get so uptight on the mere mention of the federal government doing the same. As an equity and affordability issue, giving people the option to bike safely is fundamental. Most large cities prioritize transit, walking and cycling because it doesn\u2019t make sense for most to drive. Also, people mention that people don\u2019t cycle in winter. This isn\u2019t true as Toronto\u2019s winters have become more mild other than a couple weeks of a severe cold snap. In addition, for the people who live or work downtown, I want to be able to take a walk without breathing in so much exhaust from all the cars, give people alternatives. Let the municipalities research the data and use evidence based research on where to build their bike lanes and stay in your \u201clane\u201d.\n"

        "comment": "The thousands of people forced off the TTC when there's a TTC problem speak to the need for more rapid transit, not the elimination of bike lanes. As a driver, bike lanes make ME feel safe: we're each in our own lane, and I don't have to worry driving behind a bicycle on a regular lane that the cyclist will hit a bump and tip over in front of me. More attention to regular provincial work and less butting into City of Toronto  work would be good. Someone pointed out that Doug's limo ride home is along the 401, where he wants to put a 50 billion dollar tunnel, and then along Bloor West where he wants to rip out a bike lane. It would seem he's looking after himself. As for University, those bike lanes are largely used and appreciated by the underpaid, in this province, health care workers, many of whom go to work to hit a 7:00 am start. They actually work during the hours they've contracted to do. I wonder if Doug Ford skipped out of high school classes the way he skips out of being in the Legislature.\n"
