        "comment": "I think this is a terrible idea. The city has already spent a lot of money installing these bike lanes and they protect bike riders from getting doored and hit from frustrated angry drivers. The destruction of bike lanes that already exist is incredibly redundant and could risk lives.\nIn two ways the city is contributing to the concept of induced demand. First, by keeping and building new bike lanes, drivers will see that it is in fact quicker, less frustrating and better for the environment ( and themselves) to bike to work instead of driving.  Second, by adding the  car lanes back and building more highways, gridlock will still happen because people who normally wouldn't be driving think it would be okay now that there are 'more lanes'. These extra people become the traffic, get angry and accidentally, or on purpose, hurt bikers who have no space to ride.\nCity of Toronto should take notes from Ville de Montreal, Plateau. Where it is a '15 minute neighborhood' where everything you need can be reached within 15 minutes either way. This promotes less driving and an overall safer environment for pedestrians.\nReconsider prioritizing people driving 2000-6000 pound vehicles and prioritize lives.\n"

It has also been shown that cyclists spend more money at shops when they visit.\nIt is a fact that adding more road space does not improve existing problems with car congestion but just brings more cars on the road. We need to encourage people to cycle, walk and use transit and making these safe, affordable and frequent is the answer NOT more road space for single cars.\n"

        "comment": "The provincial governments significant overreach of municipal policy will not ease gridlock in Toronto, or any other municipality across Ontario. This bill targeting specifically bike lines on Bloor, Yonge, and University, seeks to override the will of the people in the city of Toronto. We are a growing city and province, and as much as the government seeks to divide drivers and cyclists, the government should recognize that by increasing access and safety for cyclists with bike lanes, all road users, including drivers, will see safer roads and lower commuting times. Cities around the world, who have recognized that their population size simply cannot support every citizen driving, have seen major reductions in driving times due to the implementation of bike lanes. (Source: https://www.cbc.ca/news/science/bike-lanes-impacts-1.7358319 ) By adding bike lanes to our growing city and province, drivers will see decreases in their commuting times. If the province wants to continue growing the province, supplying access to roads, bike lanes, and high quality transit is the only way to ensure congestion is low. By only supplying 1 of the 3 (roads), the government cements the future of the GTA to gridlock for years to come.\n"

        "comment": "I'm strongly against this bill. The entire thing demonstrates how little this Conservative government actually cares about law, democracy and government overreach. Let me ask the following:\n- Why does Doug Ford think he knows more about traffic than municipalities, traffic professionals and academics? Why are you ignoring the advice of business associations throughout the city that support the bike lanes?\n- Why is he packaging Highway 413 and expanded powers for expropriation as part of this bill?\n- Why does he think that building more Highways or expanding lanes on streets is going to solve traffic problems? This has been our only solution for the last 50 years and it has _utterly_ failed us. We are only in this mess because we haven't invested in proper city planning and alternative mobility -- this is not a matter of opinion any more, but simply the reality of the situation we're in.\n- Why are we even discussing something as petty as bike lanes when the Eglinton LRT is STILL NOT OPEN\nPlease feel free to answer any of these questions, at some point. What a joke.\n"

I cycle year round and regularly go to appointments downtown and back. Downtown bike lanes on Bloor, University and Yonge provide a safe, direct and fast route for me to cycle. The more safe bike lanes we have the greater the number of people who ride and that\u2019s good for their mental and physical health, better for our air quality and better for vehicle congestion on our downtown streets. More riders = fewer cars. Please leave existing bike lanes and add more. If people don\u2019t want to cycle and don\u2019t want to be stuck in traffic they should be encouraged to take transit when travelling downtown.\n"

Additionally, bikes will then have to share the lanes with cars which is more dangerous and will actually increase congestion and slowdown. The issue is not the bikelane but rather constant construction; construction vehicles block not just car traffic but the bike lanes too. Deal with the real issues please instead of dividing people in Toronto.\nThank you.\nElaine\n"

        "comment": "In my opinion the removal of existing bike lanes does not make any sense. We would be faced with additional costs, and for what purpose? The number of cars would just increase, without any time savings, but with more accidents involving cyclists, more pollution and noise. Studies around the world have shown that - after initial adjustment periods - car traffic is reduced after implementation of bike lanes.\nIn my opinion, the government should look at examples of traffic management abroad, especially Europe, as a movement away from car traffic in urban areas is clearly the direction for the future. Why go back to outdated models which are not sustainable in the long run?\nOn a personal level, my family uses the bicycle for most short and medium length trips, even in winter, weather permitting. We would definitely be negatively impacted by the removal of existing bike lanes.\nGoing forward, I think the implementation of new bike lanes needs to be decided on a case-to-case basis, depending on the road conditions.\nThank you for considering my opinion, which is also the opinion of most of our friends.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes is not going to speed up traffic.  Consider this: bicycles are bound by traffic rules and alloud on city streets (unless the laws are changed to prohibit bikes on these streets: good luck with that).  If you remove bike lanes, riders will be forced to ride in lanes with cars.  For safety sake, they may LEGALLY choose to ride in the center of the lane at whatever speed they can safely maintain (about 10-15kph) Left turning cyclists would also be able to LEGALLY occupy left lanes to safely complete their turns.  How fast will traffic be moving when all those bikes are now riding in the center of both lanes and making left turns from standing position on busy streets.  For our safety, we cyclists may also legally choose to ride 2 or 3 abreast.  I can envision some road rage and heated driver/rider exchanges if this occurs.  Bike lanes not only keep riders safer but keep them from slowing down regular traffic.  Anyone who ever tried to ride on city streets knows this.  I think it's safe to say the Premier has never ridden a bike on city streets.   Perhaps to demonstrate the damage removing bike lanes can cause, someone should organize a week where cyclists en mass shun bike lanes on Bloor between North Etobicoke and Queens Park and ride in the vehicle lanes to demonstrate a world without bike lanes during Premier Ford's Daily commute.\n"

Being in that slow-moving traffic was awful and I felt lucky to be a biker and chose different routes above and below Bloor while the construction made the traffic impassable. Now that the construction is done, I love biking along Bloor and feel very safe passing through! The cars are also breezing by now that the construction is done. This bill wanting to rip out all of that hard work in the same year of it all being put together is condemning that major artery of Toronto to the exact same traffic horror once again! It doesn\u2019t make any sense to create more construction traffic in the name of creating less traffic. I oppose this bill as a biker and as a hater of construction traffic!!\n"
