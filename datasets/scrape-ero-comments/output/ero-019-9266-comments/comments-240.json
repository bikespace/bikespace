        "comment": "I am very disappointed this is even being considered. I think Doug Ford and his ministers should spend a week biking around Montreal or almost any European city to realize that allowing cities and municipalities to prioritize bikes in and to and from the downtown core does not cause extra traffic. It reduces pressure on car lanes. This seems like an ideologically driven overreach of the Ford government.\n"

        "comment": "I oppose this proposal on two primary grounds:\nFirstly, as provincial overreach: it should be up to the municipal governments to decide where bike lanes are or are not installed in their cities. Municipal government officials are more intimately familiar with their city's infrastructure needs than their provincial counterparts, and they are also more accessible to the residents actually impacted by such decisions. It does not make sense for the province to micromanage local decisions such as these.\nSecondly, as operating on a flawed premise: the idea that bike lanes make traffic worse. This idea is not supported by data (in fact, providing viable alternatives to driving can actually improve traffic rather than worsen it) and also ignores the benefits biking infrastructure provides to those who use it.\nUltimately, this proposal is a misguided approach to a problem that is outside of the province's purview and should therefore be rejected.\n"

        "comment": "As a homeowner with both a car and a bike, I feel bike lanes are a vital piece of downtown infrastructure. They allow for active transit that is safe for users and prevent bikes from having to intermingle with faster-moving vehicle traffic. Since bike lanes were made available on major routes in my city, I drive almost 70% less from March - December, choosing instead to bike and taking a vehicle off the road.\nThe volume bike lanes can support is substantial, as bikers take up much less space than drivers in large vehicles. Allowing for bike lanes is a very minor concession we should make to encourage active transport in our cities.\nPlease do not pass this bill.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to voice my opposition to this bill. While I do not bike, the implementation of bike lanes has been shown to do very little in the way of increasing traffic in a significant manner and, at times, has even reduced it. Please consider that the number of cars will decrease as infrastructure built towards alternative methods of transportation becomes available and safe. Cyclists being safely separated from drivers would give me peace of mind when I'm in my vehicle. Giving the Province authority to remove bike lanes or approve lanes is inappropriate as Ontario is a very large place and municipalities are better equipped to know what suits them and their constituents.\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nI was very disappointed when I heard about this proposed new bill and legislation from the provincial government. As Ontario and its largest cities continue to grow, it is CRUCIAL that people have a variety of methods of getting around (walking, driving, transit, cycling). We should NOT be limiting the options people have to move around. Taking cyclists OFF the roads means ADDING MORE cars onto the road, which will INCREASE congestion and travel times. For some reason, it seems this government cannot understand that fewer drivers and cars on the road = less traffic.\nAdditionally, bike lanes allow cyclists to travel on the roads safely and efficiently. Ripping up these bike lanes will make cycling unsafe and this comes at a time when 6 cyclists have already died on Toronto's roads in 2024 up from 1 death in 2023. Does this provincial government want to be responsible for MORE people dying on our roads?\nFurthermore, the notion that bike lanes are \"bad for business\" is simply false. While some Etobicoke businesses along Bloor St. West state that bike lanes have resulted in fewer customers, the Bloor Annex BIA states that the bike lanes along Bloor have resulted in an INCREASE in the number of monthly customers served by the local businesses as well as an INCREASE in monthly spending. The BIA states that removing these bike lanes along Bloor \"would be disastrous to the neighbourhood\". Various studies from around the world have shown that bike lanes make streets safer and more complete, both of which are GOOD FOR BUSINESS. Moreover, there have been false claims from both the provincial government as well as businesses on Bloor St. West stating that the bike lanes have resulted in increased emergency response times. At a recent community meeting in Ward 3 - Etobicoke Lakeshore, the Toronto Fire Deputy Chief Jim Jessop CONFIRMED that fire services have NOT SEEN AN INCREASE in response times due to the bike lanes but rather \"your response times have been improving\". Having our elected officials lie about bike lanes causing longer emergency response times is dangerous.\nRecently, Premier Ford INCORRECTLY stated how many people commute by bike. Despite more congestion within the city, in 2024 Bike Share Toronto continues to break daily ridership records and is on pace for over 6 million trips this year. This is a significant increase from its 2015 numbers of 665,000 trips. How will Toronto's roads handle 6 million MORE car trips when bike lanes are ripped out? It cannot.\nIronically, it was this provincial government in partnership with Metrolinx who built the bike lanes on Eglinton Ave that are NOW planned to be removed. Rather than focusing on removing bike lanes on Eglinton that have allowed thousands of people to actually travel along the road, there should be greater effort and focus to FINALLY open the long-delayed Eglinton Crosstown LRT. Building and then removing of bike lanes is financially irresponsible and a POOR use of people's tax dollars when this money should be used to solve the many other issues impacting Ontarians such as the collapsing healthcare system and housing crisis.\nWhy can't this government simply look at the FACTS and RESEARCH when proposing legislation rather than spewing false information to the public and wasting public tax dollars.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is a terrible idea along with being a terrible overreach of power. The Ford government continues to act against the interests of the public. This bill presents a variety of safety risks in addition to being thoroughly unsound when it comes to economic sense. Improved public transit and alternative transit options are sorely needed, and would enable reduced car usage to reduce traffic congestion overall. Make roads safe and fair. The disregard for the wellbeing of the people of Ontario is abominable from this provincial government.\n"

Getting around Toronto has become increasingly challenging and frustrating (construction, volume of cars) as has travelling our highways to get in and out of the city.\nI am a car driver/passenger, pedestrian, I take the Go Train and subway where it makes sense and I\u2019m an occasional cyclist. I heartily endorse the goal of reducing gridlock - but I think this legislation goes about it entirely wrong, and I can not support it.\nWe are all commuters trying to get somewhere - whether by car, by foot, transit, e-bike, scooter, etc. It is completely unfair to prioritize those in vehicles by reducing the safety and convenience of other methods of commuting.\nIn recent years, I have noticed a large increase in different types of commuters, often by people who can not afford to buy their own vehicles - students on scooters, delivery people on e-bikes. Their ability to use bike lanes makes them safer and is easier for drivers to navigate.\nFinally, I believe municipalities are best placed to decide where bike lanes make sense. I have not always agreed with their decisions on where to place them - but I would rather debate these issues with my local councillor and mayor then have the province override local decision making.\nI really hope the province will reconsider this legislation.\n"

We can't all drive every day - there just isn't space for it.\nWhy doesn't the government of ontario spend time and money creating better transit options instead of sinking it into reducing our options of how we can get around?\nWe should turn the gardiner into a toll highway so all the greedy folks who wants to clog up our city with their unnecessary driving can start to pay their fair share.\nTake the GO and the subway,\nDO NOT PASS THIS BILL\n"

Nobody is proposing putting bike lanes on highways!\nThe only alternative explanation is that the Government believes that municipal roads should be treated as highways. In the past, this attitude has led to the destruction of walkable neighbourhoods, and a vast uptick in the number of fatal traffic collisions involving children and motor vehicles.\nThe Government should be focused on getting *all* road users to their destinations in a timely manner. Private motor vehicles represent the least efficient use of the road, and other forms of transit---including biking---are frequently a better use of space.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are not the problem. They make journeys by bike safer and encourage road users to cycle rather than drive, thus reducing the number of cars on the road. When I'm driving, I'm very happy to see cyclists in their own lane. It makes my drive easier and more relaxing.\nThe solution to busy roads in our cities is to make it easy for residents to commute, shop and do their errands using public transport, or on foot or by bike. We can facilitate this by building, rather than removing, smart infrastructure. Some people will always need to drive, and their journeys will be easier if we can encourage as many people as possible to make other choices.\nWe need our cities to invest in transit and good infrastructure for pedestrians, cyclists and those using mobility aids, with a goal of having quieter, safer and more people-friendly streets. That's the approach I'd like to see the provincial government encouraging and funding. The province had hundreds of millions of dollars to pay off the Beer Store, rather than just waiting for 18 months, so let's use the money our province obviously has for the good of the people!\n"

The existence of dedicated bike lanes has enabled me to safely transition to biking as a regular form of commuting. This includes biking to work as well bringing my children to daycare by bike. The municipalities are best position to understand which bikes lanes are feasible in which locations, and the introduction of byzantine bureaucracy at the provincial level before bike infrastructure can be built is reminiscent is likely to be wasteful and inefficient. The provincial government should shelve this proposal and let municipalities decide what their biking infrastructure should be.\n"

Why? Because biking has so many benefits (healthy, economical, climate friendly, exciting and engaging) and driving a car is literally the opposite.\nI ride my bike year round. Did you hear me? I ride my bike year round! I have friends who ride bikes year round! And I see other people riding bikes year round!\nIt is completely false to say the Canadian winter is so long and impractical that no one rides their bikes.\nRemoving bike lanes, hindering municipalities from building bike lanes and requiring municipalities to provide all documentation before building bike lanes directly affects me! I\u2019m a Canadian citizen living in southern Ontario! How dare you go backwards in an evolving province?!\nBike lanes do not slow down traffic.\nVehicles slow down traffic.\nToo many vehicles slow down traffic!\nRemoving bike lanes will do two things:\n1- Slow down traffic because cyclists will be riding their bikes in the car lane BECAUSE YOU REMOVED THE BIKE LANE\n2- Slow down traffic because instead of you providing alternative modes of transportation, you are forcing the growing population to use cars for transportation and the roads will get fuller!!!\nAs you can see, removing bike lanes does NOT speed up traffic!!\nPlease please PLEASE focus on building an effective and connected cycling network. People will use it! Car drivers, not all but some, will opt to ride their bikes. Every person riding a bike means one less car on the road! THIS will remove excess cars from the road and will speed up car traffic!\nDo you realize how much space a car wastes per human?? Cyclists take a fraction of the space.\nAND costs a fraction of your budget to build safe and connected infrastructure (compared to infrastructure for cars)!\nMore bike lanes are needed for my generation and generations to follow.\nBuild an effective and connected cycling network and your roads will have less car traffic and less gridlock. Trust me. Look at Montreal (they also have winter!!) , look at Amsterdam, Copenhagen and even Edmonton who actually understand basic development needs and are finally planning an investment in a complete cycling network.\nIt\u2019s not rocket science. Build more bike lanes. Not less.\nYours truly,\nA year round cyclist who will not stop cycling just because you remove bike lanes.\nPs, have fun driving slowly behind me while I\u2019m biking because you took away my bike lane!\n"
