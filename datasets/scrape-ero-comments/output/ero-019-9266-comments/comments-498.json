        "comment": "Safe and comfortable cycling infrastructure is vital for increasing cycling across Canada. Protecting the health and safety of our communities, while also reducing congestion and air pollution, requires that we do as much as we can to encourage cycling. It is an objective fact that more car lanes do not reduce traffic congestion \u2013 induced demand is observed all over the world \u2013 more car lanes initially ease gridlock, but quickly lead to even more, as people switch to driving instead of taking public transit. If the provincial government is serious about reducing gridlock, they should be making investments in construction and development of transit projects, as well as more comprehensive cycling/ active transportation networks. Bicycles take up far less space than a single occupancy vehicle, therefore making much more room for those who need to drive. Local businesses benefit more from areas with bike lanes, as it is much easier (and free) to find bike parking in, for example, a downtown environment than it is to find car parking. Cycling is also a healthy option for those that can do so, investing in safe cycling infrastructure will encourage more people to cycle regularly, leading to better health outcomes for the province.\nOn top of all of the benefits, the province is seriously overreaching in municipal governments with the proposed Bill 212. This suggests the provincial government does not trust municipalities and is happy to overstep boundaries to erode the local democratic process. Bike lanes are built following extensive planning processes, research, and community input. There are already several checks to go through before one gets built, adding in another layer of approval at the provincial layer is an extreme misuse of taxpayers\u2019 money as well as the provincial governments\u2019 time. Not to mention the cost of taking out existing bike lanes \u2013 for a government that claims to be fiscally responsible, this is completely nonsensical. Aside from the issue of bike lanes, I contest the exemption of the Environmental Assessment Act for the Highway 413 Act. The building of highway 413 cannot and should not be done without conducting the appropriate environmental assessments. I am so fed up with short-sighted and selfish plans, and plead with the provincial government to think beyond the next election cycle and focus on the legacy they want to leave behind for Ontarians in 50, 100 years and beyond. Thank you to whoever reads this, I hope it makes a difference.\n"

Not only has this not been proven to improve traffic congestion, it also means an expensive endeavour to change an expensive undertaking made for the betterment of Toronto transit and safety of bike lines. There is no other reason for the provincial government to want to have an opinion on this other than to appeal to their Conservative voters.\nThe bike lanes keep civilians safe, this is more important than someone\u2019s commute time from Mississauga. Don\u2019t ruin an important part of our cities transportation to appease those who wish to drive the city rather than engage in it. This is so incredibly dumb.\n"

        "comment": "Citizens deserve choices for safe transportation and recreation that are applicable to a diverse range of needs and interests. Cities and towns understand the needs of these individuals in a way that the provincial government cannot, nor are they accountable to meeting these needs, proposing or implementing changes in the same manner as local councils, mayors etc.\nStudies assessing the safety of bike lanes appear to largely have been done where the city has powers to implement and retain them. There do not appear to be evidence that provincially controlled decisions about biking are both efficient or effective in the same way. This suggests that the only model with proof that safety of all road users is  augmented with use of high rates of supported cycling infrastructure is where the city/municipality is the responsible party, not the province.\nI've been cycling in Toronto since moving here over 25 years ago. Although recent years have shown meaningful growth, I believe that infrastructure here, and in other municipalities lags far behind other areas of the world. Local municipalities should retain power over decisions relating to cycling infrastructure as an important way of meeting their mandate, and to provide effective accountability and agency to create and sustain healthy cities that are in tune with the needs of the people they serve directly. Addressing planetary health and the climate crisis is everyone's responsibility; centralizing the issue of bike lanes ( and other forms of transportation) with the province means there are fewer partners able to enact initiatives that benefit us all.\n"

        "comment": "Hi,\nI use the bike lanes on Bloor and University every day for commuting to work. Here are the reasons why removing the bike lanes on bloor and university is a bad idea:\n1. Bike lanes make roads safe for everyone. By removing bike lanes, people are not going to stop taking the easiest and shortest route to work.\n2.  If you don't make bike infrastructure, no one will bike, so using that as a reason to not make more bike infrastructure is circular and twisted logic.\n3. Bike lanes infrastructure is minuscule compared to road infrastructure, so ripping out bike lanes is not going to make anything better.\n4. Bike delivery people will make the roads even more congested when bike lanes are ripped out and they are all sitting in cars.\nInstead of ripping out bike lanes, you should be ADDING bike lanes. Please stop this insane plan.\n"

        "comment": "Be careful of these so called \u201cstudies.\u201d It\u2019s extremely easy to bias them and many conflicting conclusions can be drawn from them depending on the way it\u2019s interpreted and looked at.\nI think the best way is to get some inspiration from cities that are actually large and dense. I just came back from vacation in Tokyo, Japan for 3 weeks and I saw so many cyclists sharing the sidewalk with high pedestrian density. And zero collisions.\nI think we have a problem here in Canada in which everyone is just thinking of themselves. The cyclists want to be able to ride at full speed, so much so that it\u2019s common to see them weave between the roads and sidewalks to avoid a red light. Pedestrians want to take up all the space on sidewalks to walk comfortably. And for automobiles, their hands are tied. They can\u2019t weave on the sidewalks.\nWe have lots of space in Canada compared to Japan. Build the bike lanes on the sidewalks. They should not take up traffic lanes. From simple physics, look at the injury risk of an automobile-cyclist collision vs cyclist-pedestrian collision. It doesn\u2019t take a genius to understand car always wins, not to mention the cyclists are not insured. Truck also wins over cyclist.\nIf the cyclists want to be on the road, then they should be treated as a motor vehicle and must have insurance. They can cause car accidents as well.\nOn the flip side, cyclists should also be allowed on the sidewalks, and share the space with pedestrians, and SLOW DOWN. If they want to go faster, then make insurance mandatory.\nAnd for those weaving between roads and sidewalks, especially to avoid traffic lights and stop signs, there needs to be enforcement and serious fines.\nEasiest way to enforce? Make insurance mandatory and implement a special government issued helmet and license plate that all cyclists above the age of 18 must wear.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose against passing this bill. Bike lanes do not cause gridlocks; removing them will not save anyone's time. Would you rather have a cyclist go back in a car to contribute to even more traffic because it's too dangerous to cycle after the Ontario government removes the lanes?\nBike lanes work. They reduce congestion and have the added benefit of reducing emissions. Get some common sense into your brains please.\n"

        "comment": "I have been a cyclist in Toronto for almost twenty years. I became a cyclist because I couldn't afford any other option: back then, a used bike might cost me $200, which was less than 2 months of a metropass, and it would give me many more months of commuting. So be sure that decisions that affect cyclists are affecting some of the poorest people in this province, who have no other means of traveling around the city.\nI imagine there will be several comments about cyclist safety, and maybe spouting statistics about the effects of removing bike lanes on traffic, but I want to focus on a different, practical aspect of removing bike lanes. Removing bike lanes does not remove bicycles from traffic. Removing bike lanes *adds* bicycles back into road traffic, and bicycles, for the most part, are *slow*. Taking bicycles out of bike lanes and putting them onto roadways--even roadways that might now have an extra lane of traffic--slows cars down.  Most cyclists are going far, far slower than the speed limit, and it can be hard for cars to pass safely. Sometimes they have to wait, or they have to switch lanes--and good luck during gridlock! With bike lanes, there is no issue of passing: bicycles are literally in a separate lane, and cars can fly right by!\n"

        "comment": "The proposal of Bill 212 affects me directly as a commuter that uses bicycle infrastructure. It has been proven time and time again that the addition of bike lanes can improve congestion, get more people using active transportation, enhances communities and commercial areas and importantly can save lives. When visiting other cities as a tourist I also use my bicycle to more fully experience the city. In Toronto I was amazed at how much more of the city I was able to encounter with the current improvements to bike infrastructure. I felt more in touch with the city, visited more neighbourhoods and spent more money than if I had been stuck in a car. Without the segregated bike lanes there is no way that I would have felt safe riding around Toronto. When commuting anywhere in my own city I plan routes based on safe cycling options. There are any number of cited studies around the world that show adding more or bigger roads does not improve congestion it in fact worsens it. The title of this proposal is disingenuous and misrepresents what the outcome such regulations would be able to control. I believe that the province stepping in to control how municipalities choose to manage  their active transporation networks is an overstep and nothing but a political ploy to gain points without providing any real solutions to gridlock.\n"

        "comment": "This Bill is absolutely asinine and will cause so many more issues for larger cities thay NEED bike lanes for pedestrians to travel safely around the city. It will cause larger ridership on local transit services that a) already cost an unaffordable amount and b) that are non functional as is with late arrival times, delays, subway shutdowns etc being frequent. Getting rid of bike lanes will not help with car congestion and only villainize people for not having vehicles. This policy needs to not go through and community voices should be listened to.\n"

        "comment": "The bike lanes on Bloor, University, and Yonge St have been a huge step forward for our city. Car ownership is not affordable for many and our transit is severely lacking. The environment is a pressing issue for many residents of Toronto. Making bike commuting accessible and safe is an incredibly powerful tool which has worked out in favour of all involved. Bike lanes DIRECTLY save lives of cyclists, allow commuters access to areas around the city, which presents them with increased work opportunities and access to businesses. Pilot projects on bloor and similar studies around the world have IMPROVED business on streets with bike lanes. Not only that, but they actually reduce traffic for drivers. Every cyclist using a lane represents someone who would otherwise be in a car, or contributing to our already severely burdened subway system. As a cyclist, but more importantly a lifelong resident of Toronto, I am EXTREMELY in favour of leaving these bike lanes intact and expanding our bike network.\n"
