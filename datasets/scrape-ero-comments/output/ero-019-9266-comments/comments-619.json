        "comment": "Bike lanes are an essential component of Toronto's shared streets. They help keep us all safe while we get around the city. Research has shown us time and again that more lanes for cars DOES NOT decrease traffic congestion. Removing bike lanes doesn't remove the number of cyclists that use the road and will likely slow traffic even more. The Ontario government should do the right thing and respect what the people in Toronto want: safer streets with clear and appropriate shared use of our roads. Keep the bike lanes, don't waste our tax dollars to rip them out and threaten peoples' lives by make our streets unsafe. I am a resident of Toronto, postal code M9N2B9.\n"

I am outraged that my Provincial government would consider tearing out infrastructure paid for by citizen's taxes.\nThe Province would be much better to invest in public transport like the TTC which is chronically underfunded AND get the Eglinton crosstown running. It is scandalous that we dont even have an opening date.\n"

        "comment": "Thanks for the opportunity to comment. Aside from the obvious benefits of all Toronto bike lanes for safety and environmental concerns, let me point out an immediate and practical point that this proposal to remove lanes seems to ignore: Business in neighbourhoods! I shop with my bike a lot, especially on Bloor St. If I loose the lanes, I'll lose the incentive and will more often turn to Amazon.\nRiding along Dundas St recently (where there are no bike lanes), I noticed that the traffic is snarled mostly because of parking. Cars stop, pull in and out, etc. Not efficient. So instead of removing bike lanes, perhaps use this 48 million to provide off-street parking on such streets.\nIt would be helpful for the Gov't to be practical, doing what's best for safety, the environment, and everyone's needs to get around. Leave the bike lanes. Leave such decisions to elected officials in Toronto.\n"

My use of a bike reduces my use of a car and reduces congestion. Bike lanes make biking a safe option and removal of bike lanes will decrease biking and increase car use in the city.\nBike lanes improve the quality of life in the city and I strongly support maintaining and increasing bike lanes in the city\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my deep concern regarding the Province\u2019s proposal to remove bike lanes on Yonge Street, Bloor Street, and University Avenue under the Bill 212 Act. As a UHN employee and avid cyclist, I have commuted over 14,197 miles by bike since 2020. This mode of transport not only saves me 15\u201320 minutes per commute but also supports my physical and mental health, reduces transportation costs, and minimizes my environmental footprint by significantly lowering greenhouse gas emissions.\nBefore the implementation of the Bloor Street bike lanes, I experienced firsthand the dangers of cycling on unprotected streets when I was hit by a driver. This incident underscored the critical importance of protected bike lanes in ensuring the safety and survival of vulnerable road users. These lanes are essential for me and the many UHN employees who rely on cycling as a daily means of transportation.\nThe proposed removal of these essential bike lanes would not only endanger lives but also undermine efforts to promote sustainable, healthy, and environmentally friendly transportation systems.\nIn addition to safety concerns, it is worth noting that traffic congestion in Toronto is not solely caused by bike lanes. Many congested areas without bike lanes suffer from issues such as two-way streets, extensive on-street parking, poorly coordinated traffic lights, and complex intersections, which create delays and confusion for drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians alike. Studies from cities like New York have demonstrated that implementing protected bike lanes alongside a one-way street system can improve traffic flow, boost local business, and enhance safety for all road users. For example, New York City\u2019s report on bicycle path data illustrates the positive effects of protected bike lanes on urban mobility and commerce (NYC Bicycle Path Data Analysis).\nI strongly advocate for safer streets by supporting the retention of these bike lanes. By doing so, we can protect infrastructure that ensures safety, accessibility, and sustainability for our community.\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n"

        "comment": "Please remove the bike lanes on Bloor street. There is about one bike for every thousand cars. All the cars are cutting through side streets. Humbercrest Blvd between BabyPoint and Old Mill is like a highway now. The knock on effect in the community is terrible. Please put pedestrian access points to Magwood park back. The staircase from BabyPoint to Magwood, the ramp from Lessard Park to Humbercrest and the closing of the path from Humbercrest to the parking lot in Etienne Bruce park means that pedestrians have to walk on the very busy streets. Everything done recently is wrong. Thank you.\n"

        "comment": "I am vehemently against any proposal to remove our bike lanes in Toronto.\nFor the following reasons\nCost- the cost is absurd and completely unnecessary\nClimate- One of the most important actions an individual can take to reduce their carbon footprint is to ride a bike or walk in their city rather than drive even if that vehicle is a fully electrified vehicle. The carbon savings is enormous. Given the recent floods in Spain, forest fires in Jasper, and hurricanes in the Unites States as well as deaths due to heat waves it is more than evident that the climate crisis is worsening at an alarming rate and anything citizens can do to lower our emissions is vital.\nSafety and personal choice- If I choose to ride a bike to my destination I would like to do so safely. As a sixty year old having the bike lanes has absolutely changed my commute  for the better. I can safely ride to work and to restaurants, cafes etc... feeling safe and stress free. The bike lans have allowed me to do this.\nPersonal savings- By using the bike lanes I have saved thousands of dollars on TTC , on ubers, and even on charging my family's electric vehicle.\nIndividual health- Riding my bike for my commute has greatly enhanced my cardiovascular health and decreased the time I need to spend exercising in other ways.\nPublic health- having a healthier public will reduce overall provincial health costs.\nTourism- Safe bikeable and walkable streets are excellent for tourism and create attractive, healthier more people friendly cities.\n"

I've taken the TTC across the Bloor line. And finally, after about six months in service, I tried the Bloor St. and University bike lanes.\nThe bike lanes are not yet as well used as the subway or roadway. The choice is up to the commuter. It took me six months to get around to it (the bike lanes) and now that is my first choice of commuting in the morning.\nI've waited at red lights with upwards of ten other bicycles. From my frequent observations, there are often up to ten cars waiting as well. What I find interesting is that the cars that drive down Bloor St., for example, are over 90% of the time carrying just one person, the diver!\nWhen the TTC goes down on Bloor, which is quite often, all bike share bikes are immediately taken off their racks and put to good use. Why take away a very good third means of transportation when usage will only increase over time. Build it and they will ride.\nThe decision to remove the bike lanes is short sighted. This decision should be left to the city as the bike lanes represent a vision for Toronto which will take time to implement.\n"

As a motorist I appreciate knowing where the bikes are and not being scared they will have to veer out into traffic - to go around an obstacle or turn etc. I also appreciate they are protected. I recently drove on Bloor St west from Spadina past High Park during rush hour and the traffic (incl lots of bikes) moved much better than on parallel streets like Dupont or St Clair.\nToronto did a lot of work incl consultations about bike lanes. The province should not overturn the decisions they made.\n"

Yes, bike lanes will cause some discomfort in the short term as people have to drive a few minutes longer. But we won't get out of our cars unless driving becomes the less convenient option. I think it is a very wrong headed move to remove bike lanes that municipalities have determined will help us reduce car use, even if it is politically expedient in the short term. I encourage the government of Ontario to take a long term view and support municipalities that are trying to reduce our use of fossil fuels.\n"

I want bike lanes to keep bikes as safe as possible while I drive, and the last thing any car driver wants is an accident or near miss with a bike.\nBikes are going to use the roads, bike lanes or not. Better for all of us if the traffic is separate from them.\nFurthermore the more dangerous for bicyclists, the more of them will get back into their cars. This will nullify any improvement in traffic from reclaiming a lane.\nNaked power grab or weird flex from Ford. Either way it\u2019s embarrassing.\n"

As such, I find it far more efficient, and pleasant, to ride my bike everywhere. The dedicated bike lanes have transformed my experience as a cyclist.\nA couple of times a week, I visit my aging parents who live at Dupont and Davenport. I'm happy to leave my car parked and wend my way up to their neighbourhood via bike lanes. Would you prefer I take my car and add to the congestion?\nWe don't need more cars on the streets of Toronto - we need fewer. Encourage people to cycle safely and take public transit. The physics of more cars on our already clogged streets do no make sense.\nNo other city in the world is going backwards on this issue, as the province seems poised to do.\nIn addition, let the city decide what is best for the city.\n"
