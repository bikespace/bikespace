        "comment": "I am both a cyclist, use public transport and also drive a car.  Although there may be cases that require a readdressing of bike lanes, however this needs to be a city and municipality responsibility and decision .   This Bill is a heavy handed approach that is being driven by a few conservative financial supporters of Doug Ford, who live in Doug Fords riding and are very privileged.  This is about pre election vote pandering  at a time when election is looming.\nThe cost to tax payers to rip out all bike lanes in the City of Toronto would be $75 million according to a report released by the City of Toronto.  This would be an overwhelming  waste of money especially at a  when there is not enough funding for health care, education, public transportation etc. and  we are seeing a record number of the working poor at food banks.  This Bill would put the safety of cyclists in danger and more deaths would occur on our streets. It will leave few options for those that can not afford public transit.\nGrid lock is about having too many cars in downtown Toronto not about a bike lane. I live in Bloor West Village and see the cars going downtown each morning, most  with only one person per car. There is a subway line on Bloor St.  Get people out of their cars. What we need is to incentivize people to take public transit. Make it easier to park at the end of the subway lines, more parking, more buses that run more frequently.\nI am thoroughly disgusted with this Bill and the little thought that has been put into  what  the implications would mean for all of us. I  say  a loud resounding  NO to Bill 212.\n"

Stop wasting taxpayer money ripping out progress and focus on 1) educating the public around new commuting behaviors that get people out of single driver cars and into public transport and onto bikes 2) on finishing the Eglinton crosstown and demanding transparency of its progress, 3) on investing in park and pay lots so that commuters can use these city services, 4) and on implementing a congestion tax asap - along the lines of Paris and other innovative cities. The Ford government wants to take us back- we need to move forward and celebrate Toronto\u2019s future. Leave my bike lanes alone! In fact, build more, rather than spend time and energy we don\u2019t have commissioning inaccurate or partial surveys.\n"

Bike lanes are vital to the health of people and the planet. And people care about their loved ones on bikes and the future of our cities and the environment. THis proposal is going to cost tax payers so much money. It is going to sink millions of dollars invested in creating the bike lanes. And for what? Saving a few extra minutes in a car - the most inefficient way to get around a city. This will set toronto back and make us a backwards city that is more of a suburb than a world class city. And it puts people's lives at risk. I cannot wrap my head around it. nevermind how expensive it is! How is the gvt planning to afford this? Put your money into health care and education and get out of municipal politics!\n"

        "comment": "As a homeowner, taxpayer, and citizen of the City of Toronto, I rely on walking, biking, driving, and public transit to navigate our city. I am strongly opposed to Bill 212, which purports to address congestion on Ontario\u2019s municipal roads. Prioritizing motorists to \u201csave time\u201d or \u201cget drivers where they need to go faster\u201d disregards the safety and well-being of all road users, including cyclists, scooter users, e-bike riders, and pedestrians.\nThis bill appears to favor motorists passing through neighborhoods rather than prioritizing those who live, work, and shop within them. Why does this legislation overlook the safety and needs of vulnerable road users? Studies consistently highlight the economic, health, environmental, and safety benefits of bike lanes, which enhance the quality of life for everyone.\nKey Points:\n1.\tSafety: Bike lanes provide a safer environment for cyclists. Removing them forces cyclists to share the road with cars, increasing the likelihood of accidents and congestion when cyclists must \u201ctake the lane.\u201d This outcome is neither efficient nor safe.\n2.\tEnvironmental Benefits: Encouraging cycling reduces car usage, leading to improved air quality. With dedicated bike lanes, people are more likely to choose cycling, especially for short trips, which benefits the environment and urban sustainability.\n3.\tHealth: Cycling is a healthier mode of transportation, promoting physical activity and reducing healthcare costs in the long term.\n4.\tEconomic Impact: Bike lanes support local businesses. Cyclists can stop and park their bikes more easily than drivers can find car parking, particularly in busy urban areas like downtown Toronto. Studies show that bike-friendly infrastructure boosts local economies.\nCity councils are best positioned to determine the configuration of their streets. They have the expertise to study traffic flow, consult stakeholders, and balance the needs of all users. Streets should be safe, inclusive spaces that reflect the needs of the communities they serve. The province lacks the local knowledge required to make these decisions and should respect municipal autonomy.\nI do not support removing bike lanes or provincial interference in street planning. Instead, I urge the government to withdraw this proposed legislation and redirect any funds intended for removing bike lanes to areas of provincial jurisdiction, such as education and healthcare. This would be a far more effective and responsible use of taxpayer dollars.\nThank you for considering this perspective.\n"

        "comment": "My wife and me are NOT in support of this proposed Act.\nRemoval of existing bike lanes on Bloor, Yonge & University will not materially relieve traffic congestion in Toronto and will increase risk of serious injuries and deaths for both pedestrians and cyclists. These 3 streets are well served by subway access and our provincial government needs to prioritize policy on expanding and encouraging citizens to use public transit for their trips. The Ontario Government\u2019s introduction of One Fare in February 2024 is a great example.\nBike lanes support the increasing density and growing number of people living along these three streets. They provide safe & direct passage on roads increasingly occupied by larger sized personal vehicles like SUVs and trucks making it more difficult to safely share a lane. We have also noticed they are used by people of all ages riding various electric mobility devices. Bike lanes are part of the solution to relieving congestion.\nWe also feel the province is overreaching in requiring municipalities to seek provincial approval for bike lanes where a traffic lane is removed. This feels like unnecessary red tape when municipal elected officials are best positioned to make these decisions.\n"

        "comment": "I am a Toronto-based motorist, but I strongly believe that Toronto should have the authority to plan their own bike lane network without interference from the province. I recognize that Toronto is part of a larger network, however the citizens of Toronto must take precedence over Ontario when it comes to city planning, and the city of Toronto voted for a progressive agenda that includes bike lanes.\nFurther, eliminating bike lanes, even on main thoroughfares such as Bloor, Yonge and University, will not have the effect of reducing congestion because it will incentivize people to drive on those routes, which will immediately fill up any additional capacity from additional lanes. As a motorist, I recognize that the only way to reduce congestion is to encourage people to cycle instead of drive.\nA robust bike lane network including lanes on main thoroughfares is the best way to encourage cycling, and it's what the citizens of Toronto voted for. As a bonus, it increases safety. People will still cycle on main routes, but it is safer for everyone if they are separated from traffic. Please do not eliminate the bike lanes and take away Toronto's ability to plan its own biking network.\n"

        "comment": "I feel the bike lanes the cith of Toronto put in are absolutely wonderful and am begging you not to take them away.  Finally I felt safe enough to ride a bike in the city.  That coupled with the Bike Ride Share make me very happy.\nSo far I have only had the opportunity to use them a few times.  If I had realized the Bloor Bike lane went as far east as it does, I would have used it more often.  I have been looking forward to using the bike lane instead of my car to get down town to medical appoitments.  If you take them away, I will likely continue to drive.  The reason for this is time.  When I have the time, sure, I'll take TTC but if I am pressed for time, I will drive.  Taking a bike is almost the same amount of time as driving the car.  The TTC takes at least twice as long.\nSo do I believe the bike lanes have the possiblity of decreasing gridlock?  I sure do.  I expect I am not the only one who will be driving again rather than using a bike to get downtown if you take them away.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 is an egregious overreach of this provincial government, demonstrates the government's lack of understanding of public infrastructure, and is far from what a \"common sense\" approach actually looks like.\nThis bill removes checks and balances needed for democratic governing. It seeks to extend the provincial government's power to take land away from residents without opposition and bypass environmental assessment to build a highway that cuts through a designated greenbelt. In addition, this government is trying to take control of decisions that should belong to the municipal governments, namely, the City of Toronto.\nIf this bill had taken a common sense approach towards reducing traffic, it would have prioritized investment in other modes of transportation, such as further developing cycling infrastructure or ensuring that public transportation projects like the Eglinton line are completed in a timely manner. (As a reminder, The Eglinton is in its 14th year of construction, with no firm opening date.)\nFurthermore, it is baffling that this bill ignores facts, nor can it demonstrate an understanding of \"induced demand\" (e.g., how increasing the supply of something leads to increased use) and how it impacts traffic. We've actually seen this concept play out with the expansion of Highway 401, which led to more cars on the highway and more traffic.\nWe've also seen this happen with cycling, which has grown in popularity within Toronto after installing the same bike lanes this bill seeks to destroy. Bike lane use has increased exponentially, up to 600% in certain areas, according to a recent report by Toronto's City Hall, with Bikeshare ridership experiencing record demand in 2024 (Bike Share Toronto's director expects that more than six million trips will be taken on Bike Share by the end of the year). New building developments within the city have noticed this trend and built ample bike storage into their construction plans. Even celebrities have taken to cycling around the streets of Toronto; Arnold Schwarzenegger is known to get around the city on a bike.\nLastly, world-class cities such as London, Paris, and New York City are investing more in their cycling infrastructure. They understand and have seen the benefits of making cycling more viable: it has led to reductions in traffic, lowers toxic pollution caused by vehicles, creates safer roads, increases local business, and provides a reliable and cheap mode of transportation for low-income residents.\nBill 212 will achieve the exact opposite: it will increase traffic, pollution, and accidents and decrease foot traffic, which supports local business sales. What will the province do when traffic continues to rise despite ripping out the bike lanes? Will they take out the sidewalks next?\nWe know what's causing traffic: it's the endless construction projects and the increase in car use post-pandemic. Not bikes.\nThis bill will leave Toronto behind, burden the rest of the province with the high costs to undo the work already done, and position Ontario to pay even more to catch up to the rest of the world.\n"

There are issues with jurisdiction and overreach, the waste of resources to implement this bill (for the province and municipalities), the false statements related to how to combat congestion, the negative impact on efforts around road safety improvements, etc. As a Professional Engineer and Registered Professional Planner with over 20 years experience working in the private sector on infrastructure in the province, I prepared a written submission for the Standing Committee on Heritage, Infrastructure and Cultural Policy. The focus for my submission was on municipal process. The main points included: (1) At what point in a city\u2019s planning process would it be known that a travel lane would need to be removed as a result of adding a bike lane? When would a call be made to the Minister of Transportation? (2) The proposed legislation in Bill 212 will slow down all types of roadway improvement projects in Ontario (in communities of all sizes), regardless of whether a bike lane is proposed or not. (3) Why do vehicle lanes on your roadways ever get removed? And why can it be a good thing that people are asking for? (4) What analysis is used in the transportation engineering/planning profession to demonstrate no impact on vehicle traffic?\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to voice my objection to Bill 212.\nThe provincial government\u2019s myopic focus on maximizing private vehicle speeds will put the lives of all road users at risk, including pedestrians, cyclists and, yes, drivers. With respect to the latter, study after study has shown that complete streets that give adequate space for all road users reduces vehicular collisions and injuries by 30-50%. The reason is simple: roads are easier to navigate when everyone has their own space.\nMeanwhile, narrower streets allow drivers to operate motor vehicles at a speed that reflects the environment, without having to rely on the use of police or radar enforcement. Alternatively, removing bike lanes in favour of wider multi-lane roads designed solely to maximize vehicle throughput are not only less liveable for nearby residents and businesses, but significantly deadlier as they encourage dangerous driving regardless of the actual posted speed limit.\nAt the same time, removing bike lanes will do nothing to ease gridlock. Vehicular congestion is not caused by bike lanes. Traffic is caused by too many cars. Reducing the number of single-occupancy vehicles on our roads through the provision of safe alternatives including walking, bike lanes and rapid transit is the solution to congestion. Even if these alternatives mean reducing the amount of space on public roads dedicated to private vehicles.\nA provincial government \u2013 in particular one that label\u2019s itself a small \u201cc\u201d  government that abhors federal interference in its affairs \u2013 should not introduce legislation that interferes with municipal decision-making and autonomy. This includes adding additional layers of red tape to local infrastructure planning and development. Infrastructure that is paid for and maintained not by the province, but through local property taxes.\n"

I rely on biking as my main mode of transportation in the city, and bike daily to do errands, grocery shop, go to farmer's markets, shop downtown, Kensington, Bloor, St. Lawrence Market, Canadian Tire, Eaton Centre, or salon, spa, dr. and dentist appointments along Yonge, near St. Clair and Davisville.  As well bike to dinner and lunch meetups with friends at least once a week.   I find it's much faster than driving, and the addition of the University, Bloor and Yonge bike lines has encouraged me to ride more frequently as the bike lanes provide safer and more direct access to get around the city.\nIt's not the bike lanes that are causing congestion in the city. It' s all the construction and closed roads. I bike on University at least twice a week and traffic is usually moving smoothly. The more frequent cause of traffic backup is when cars 'block the box\"  I see this happen daily, and even though fines have increased for this infraction, I have not once seen anyone be reprimanded for stopping in the middle of the intersections, and blocking traffic. This happens all the time on University\nRemoving bike lanes will mean more cars will be on the road.If it's not safe to bike, or if there is no bike lane, I will have no other choice but to take UBER, which defeats the purpose of removing bike lanes\nToronto is finally more accessible, and I was extremely pleased when the bike lane network expanded, making it easier, faster and more safe to navigate the downtown area\nPlease do not remove the bike lane on University Avenue, or Bloor st from Dovercourt to the Danforth\nRegards,\nJessie\n"
