        "comment": "I am writing to oppose Bill 212.\nAs a driver, it won't save me time to have the streets that have been torn up to put in bike lanes clogged with construction again, to remove them. This is a waste of money and other resources that could be put towards other traffic solutions.\nI also am much more comfortable having the cyclists separated from the cars, it is safer and much more predictable. Cyclists on busy streets without bike lanes can cause a lot of difficulty to drivers, as they either take a whole lane, or weave in and out of traffic.  Having them separated is preferable to me as a driver.  There are not alternate routes to the lanes on Bloor and University, so removing the lanes will just bring the cyclists back into traffic, making it more difficult and reduce safety for everyone.\nThis is an ill thought out amendment, comes at great cost and reduces safety for everyone on the roads, all for a minute or two of reduced commute time for cars.  It doesn't make sense.\n"

        "comment": "Every single study on bike lanes proves that they help reduce congestion and gridlock. But Doug is too petty and closed-minded to bother reading studies because he openly admits he doesn\u2019t believe them. It is deeply embarrassing to have a Premier that does not believe scientific studies. It is doubly embarrassing that Ontario is becoming a laughing-stock as international media picks up this story snd underlines how foolish this bill is. But we\u2019re here because Doug is shameless and petty and unimaginative. He routinely complains about bike lanes but never seems to mind that miles of roads are clogged with on-street parking and an entire lane is lost that way. Doug Ford ruins everything he touches, and our cycling infrastructure is just one example.\nCyclists will just ride in the road, which is more dangerous for everyone.\n"

        "comment": "Please reconsider this short-sighted strategy, which will not solve gridlock, and will have the immediate impact of making conditions LESS SAFE for pedestrians in neighbourhoods.\nI am a resident of the Kingsway neighbourhood, residing only 200 metres from the intersection of Royal York Road, and Bloor Street West. My wife works on Bloor, my child attends activities along Bloor, and we do nearly all our shopping in the neighbourhood by foot.\nSince the Bloor West Complete Street project, the roads have become SIGNIFICANTLY more safe for my family. Walking along Bloor has become safer, as the intersection redesign reduces the speed of traffic turning across crosswalks. Not only has walking become much more safe, but cycling no longer requires that we take up a full lane of car traffic, and has become an enjoyable alternative for my family, allowing us to remove a car from the road for some of our trips.\nMeanwhile, I use my car daily to commute along Bloor, and have seen only a modest increase in my commute time along this corridor, which is a small inconvenience when set against the benefits of a safer environment for residents.\nHowever, my commute times along the QEW have seen significant increase, and this is a corridor that will not see any improvements whatsoever by the proposed changes in this bill. With the growing population and density along the QEW corridor, what is most-needed are investments into transportation alternatives for Ontarians.\n"

        "comment": "It is with great dismay that I heard about the Provincial Government's proposal to remove existing bike lanes in the city of Toronto. I live in the west end of the city, am retired, and use my bicycle for much of the year when there isn't snow on the streets. I regularly drive Bloor St. both in a car and on a bicycle. I believe that it is vital to maintain and expand safe bicycle routes through the city. Riding a bicycle on roads without a bike lane is dangerous. Bike paths in cities are the future, and it is the only way we are going to maintain a livable downtown that is not congested with cars.\nThe idea that congestion will be eased by making it more easy for cars to get downtown is absurd. We need fewer cars, not more. As anyone who has visited any major city in Europe will see, the answer to traffic is less traffic. Yes, the roads should allow for cars to pass efficiently, but bike lanes are not impeding that. It is construction projects, poor planning, and too many vehicles.\nPlease come to your senses and base your decisions on sound evidence, not anecdotal information from angry drivers.\n"

        "comment": "Gridlock and traffic are getting worse in Toronto. That requires innovative policy solutions that consider how to maximize affordable mobility. Bill 212, in targeting bike lanes on major thoroughfares, fails to offer an evidence-based approach, making use of the best understanding we have on what causes congestion and how to minimize it. It seems intuitively clear to those stuck in a car on Bloor St that the bike lane is slowing them down. Yet those who study the issue carefully seem to have concluded that  removing bicycle lanes, Bill 212 will do little or nothing to improve traffic flow.\nIt is also bad policy and bad government for the Provincial government to legislate on this matter which is clearly a municipal issue.\n"

        "comment": "I am appalled about this proposal to remove bike lanes in the City of Toronto, and for the increasing red tape this proposal would put on the development of new bike lanes in the city. As homeowners in this increasingly expensive city, my family benefits immensely from all the modes of transportation available to us. We drive a car when necessary, use the TTC on a daily basis, and make use of the bike lanes very regularly. I travel the city often with my 9 yr old by bike, and to think of doing so without dedicated bike lanes would be absolutely irresponsible and dangerous for us.\nWe all know the statistics and the incredible amount of accidents bikers face when riding on streets without dedicated bike lanes. Risking our lifes, especially my daughters bikes just to decrease commute times for car drivers by mere minutes is an abhorrent option.\nThis is an incredibly important issue for me and my family. If  Doug Ford continues with this type of actions that destroy my city's public infrastructure to benefit the privileged few, he and his conservative team are guaranteed to loose my votes.\n"

Without the bike lanes, you will have cars, trucks and bikes together on the same narrow road, causing cars to move slower in and around the individuals cycling. It is more dangerous for everyone involved and will not result in better traffic flow.\nThis is all to say nothing of the traffic that will be caused by the construction necessary to remove them.\n"

        "comment": "I am a cyclist in Toronto. Removing the bike lanes on Yonge, Bloor and University is a terrifying and dangerous prospect as those lanes are used quite frequently and sharing a lane with car traffic opens more opportunities to get hit or injured. Adding more car lanes does not reduce gridlock, this has already been studied and proven. If this province wants to reduce gridlock and gas emissions, it should invest in more protected bike lanes (to encourage more people to bike), consistent public transit, and high speed rail transportation.\nI want to live in a city where I have the freedom to move through out it in relative safety and there is less noise and air pollution caused by vehicles. It's 2024, it is about time this country/province acknowledges that building more infrastructure for cars is backwards thinking.\nThank you.\n"

Instead, it will put more cyclists in danger - danger that they are already put in with our poor bike lanes. 70% of Toronto residents ride a bike, and riders took 4.7M trips via Bike Share Toronto in 2023.

        "comment": "I would like to convey my personal experience regarding riding a bicycle not only in Brampton, where I live, but also in Toronto, where I cycle many times during the year for pleasure.\nSince I starting riding my bicycle in 2017, I have increased my trips with each passing year, not only for the fun rides I do but also for my commuting rides.  I never took my bicycle to go grocery shopping or simple errands around town.  I do these much of the time now.\nIn 2017, the bike lanes in Brampton, as well as Toronto were at a much lower volume than they have grown to in recent years especially.  I am a road warrior and have not had fear of the cars.  However, in saying that, car drivers have become more dangerous and less mindful and aware of their road surroundings and cyclists have become more at risk.\nWith the increased cycling lanes that have been put in place, protected or not, I have made it a point to use these lanes as much as possible.  They have provided protection and added confidence that I will be safer than on the road.  I have appreciated greatly and efforts to have these put in place on roads where it made sense.  Many are secondary roads.  I have not noticed any congestion here in Brampton due to the lanes being put in.  I have cycled to Toronto a few times this year on Bloor Street and University Avenue and other roads and have also not noticed any more congestion than you normally would experience otherwise.\nThese lanes are providing safety and saving lives.  Installing these lanes also means traffic calming which is safer because drivers need to slow down as speed is an ever continuing and growing issue.  I have noticed over the years that there are more cycling commuters on the roads and using the lanes because owning a vehicle has become ever increasingly expensive and some cannot afford this, so a bicycle is a viable option.\nAlong with improving public transit options and increasing cycling as a means of transportation, we have limited other options to reduce car users and the exponentially increasing drivers out there.  We should not aim to increase car traffic and continue to build more roads or wider roads.  The environment calls for better options and as the saying goes \"If you build it, they will come\".  It is working and cycling traffic has increased with the increase of cycling lanes.\n"

        "comment": "Ontario is projecting to add 6.1 million residents over the next 23 years, with the GTA expected to absorb 3 million of those (Ontario\u2019s Long-Term Report on the Economy 2024). In order to accommodate the transportation needs of the growing population, as well as the existing population, a focus shift to moving people is needed instead of moving cars. Key to this is expanding both bicycle infrastructure as well as transit. Both modes have a higher capacity for moving people than cars for a given amount of space.\nThe key to good bicycle infrastructure is a connected network of protected lanes along roadways where people want to be. People use bikes to access the same shops and services located of the main roads as everyone else because they, too, are part of our society. They are not some other classification of person.\nPersonally, I don\u2019t ride a bicycle. I drive, or walk, or take transit. But when I choose to drive I much prefer roads that now have separated bicycle infrastructure as there is clarity about who has the right of way and traffic operations are more predictable. Everyone just want to be able to get home safely as a first priority.\n"
