It cannot be understated how important these bike lanes are for safety. I feel that I don't fear for my life when I am using the bike lanes. Putting a hold on or scrapping new bike lanes that require the removal of traffic lanes will surely result in more injuries and deaths for cyclists. Unfortunately, Toronto does not have a clean record when it comes to motorist/cyclist collisions, and regardless of who is at fault, the cyclist will be the one to bear an injury from a motorist/cyclist collision. Please don't pass this bill!\n"

        "comment": "The removal of bike lanes will not appreciably improve traffic, and will simply result in streets that are more dangerous while wasting a huge amount of tax payer money.\nThe only way to reduce gridlock and congestion is to provide methods of transportation that are more space efficient than cars, that means more mass transit and more bike lanes. More space on the road just causes induced demand. People need to and want to move around the city, but it does not have to be by car. Providing safe, efficient, and cost effective alternatives will mean that people who must travel by car will have the road space to do so, while those who can travel other ways will choose to.\nRather than removing these bike lanes, more should be added to encourage people to travel in a more space efficient way.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are vital to this city! As a cyclist who commutes, bike lanes help keep me safer than if I were to bike in the same lane as cars. When I do have to bike on a road with no bike lanes, I am anxious the entire time. There have been many close calls, and on occasion I have had to bike in the middle of the lane, in order to keep myself safe (and much to the chagrin of drivers behind me). To remove bike lanes is to increase travel times for everyone!\nAnd if the goal is to reduce gridlock and congestion, there are far better ways to do it! Truly, if the bike lanes go, I would have to start driving or taking an uber and that would just add to the number of vehicles on the road, increasing congestion AND increasing emissions.\nAdditionally, since when does the province get involved with municipal roads? This is a gross overreach and an entirely unnecessary proposal. Increase public transit, increase bike lanes, and don't let us move backwards!\n"

        "comment": "Hello! Hope you're having a nice day.\nI'm here to voice my opposition to bill 212. Decades of research shows the failure of adding lanes to reduce traffic and congestion, since the traffic throughput is bottle-necked by INTERSECTIONS. We have to trust the science here.\nAdding lanes only worsens our living spaces, making them less pleasant, less safe, more expensive to maintain and use for travel (since you'd need a car + insurance to use it), all the while doing basically nothing to actually improve our transportation woes. Empirical research shows this will worsen traffic by inducing more demand for car travel (check links for more on that)\nAs public trustees, I implore you folks to do more research into this. It's frustrating and, I'm sad to say, quite embarrassing, to compare our traffic issues with my European friends who live and travel in and around comparably dense cities to Toronto or Ottawa, but they have infinitely safer and more pleasant routes and destinations due to their investment in solutions that put PEOPLE FIRST instead of cars.\nAlways prioritize public transport, trains and bikes.\nAlso, please give the linked videos a listen, if you have the time. The people there are a lot better-researched and more qualified to make my points than I am. You can find their resources and citation links in each video's description box.\nIf you want a real win with people, do what's best for them, instead of helping erode the social and environmental guardrails we've thoughtfully put in place in the past to prevent bad actors from degrading our living conditions for their own profit down the line.\nThanks for hearing me out!\nMuch love.\n"

        "comment": "I oppose Bill 212 and the removal of dedicated bike lanes from Toronto's streets.\nAs a professional who works downtown, I have used the bike lanes along Bloor West Avenue to access my work.  My teenage and young adult children, bicycle to their part-time jobs along this corridor - both into downtown and out to Etobicoke. Biking offers so much greater advantage over cars when it comes to city commuting - it is healthy for our bodies, it is economically more viable, it is better for the environment - and it makes for less congestion from cars!!  Dedicated and separated bike lanes are vital for the safety of riders.  Before bike lanes were introduced, I was side-swiped by a car when riding my bicycle downtown resulting in a concussion.  The data available regarding the impact of bike lanes show that it is NOT NEGATIVE.  For example, it does NOT negatively effect response time of emergency vehicles.  Businesses have not been negatively affected by bike lanes and on the contrary - businesses would see less customer traffic if they were removed.\nBill 212 and the removal of dedicated bike lanes will negatively impact the quality of life for me, my family and many other Torontonians.  DO NOT TAKE AWAY BIKE LANES!!\n"

But that was a long, li=ong time ago. We have to move on.\nYes, there is gridlock everywhere in Toronto but the solution is to cut down the number of parking spaces along the main arteries.   People leave their cars parked along Bloor, University and the Danforth for hours at a time. Those parked cars serve no usual purpose.  Move them into parking lots off the main arteries so the rest of us can get to work, by car, by bicycle or even better, by subway.\n....\n"

        "comment": "I adamantly oppose the removal of bike lanes in a growing city like Toronto. These lanes have already been paid for and studied over the last few years - removing them is not a responsible choice both financially and from a safety perspective. This is not forward thinking, nor takes factual data in mind. Cities throughout the world are increasing bike lanes, encouraging less cars on the road, giving different methods of travel, etc. This is not an urban vs. suburban discussion. This is about making the roads safe for all people of Ontario, working together. Local businesses have said that bike lanes increase foot traffic, traffic is moving, people are safer. There isn't much argument to be made for removal. Ford's government should be focused on highways, public transit infrastructure, etc. This is such an overreach and waste of the Provinces resources and time.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my concerns regarding\nOntario Bill 212, the \"Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024.\" As someone who commutes to Toronto regularly ttc + biking to work in addition to driving, I believe this bill will not achieve its intended goal of reducing gridlock and will instead create new problems.\nFirstly, the bill's approach to addressing gridlock is short-sighted. We need comprehensive and forward-thinking strategies that include expanding and improving public transportation infrastructure.\nInvestments in reliable and efficient transit systems will entice more people out of their cars, leading to a more sustainable and less congested urban environment. Metrolinx is accountable to your Ministry and yet the significant cost overruns, quality issues, lack of transparency, and the years long delay in opening is where the Ministry should be focusing. Especially as Metrolinx is currently in the process of building the infrastructure for the Ontario line. Traffic congestion caused by that project is considerable but also understandable given the priority of public transportation. Your Ministry should be focused on transparent, and on time delivery of that project instead.\nSecondly, the removal of bike lanes represents a waste of public funds. Municipalities like Toronto have invested significantly in cycling infrastructure to promote safer and more sustainable transportation options. Reversing these investments is not only fiscally irresponsible but also counterproductive to long-term transportation goals. I do not want my tax payer dollars spent dismantling perfectly good infrastructure that taxpayers have already invested\nAnd lastly, removing bike lanes will not alleviate traffic congestion. In fact, it may worsen it by discouraging cycling, which is a viable and eco-friendly alternative to driving. Effective long-term solutions to gridlock require better capital planning around projects like the Gardiner and the Ontario line, as well as robust investments in public transportation. Encouraging more people to use public transit and cycle can significantly reduce the number of cars on the road, thereby easing traffic congestion.\nI urge you to reconsider the provisions of Bill 212 and to focus on sustainable and effective solutions to reduce gridlock.\nSincerely,\nBerna\n"

        "comment": "I am a driver and a cyclist in Toronto. Removing cycle lanes will only increase the danger to cyclists and lead to more cyclist fatalities - full stop. The irony in what you are proposing is that cyclists will continue to cycle on the routes with the removed lanes as these are major streets and they have every right to use the same major streets as cars. This will only endanger cyclists' lives and cause more traffic gridlock because bikes and cars will now be sharing lanes. As a car driver, I want cyclists in dedicated lanes so they are not mixed in with car traffic. Please please please reconsider removing bike lanes - my life on a bike should be as valuable as a driver's life in a car.\n"

It\u2019s a slap in the face to anyone who understands urban planning. All this does is add more cars to the road which further increases traffic! It\u2019s completely non-sensical.\nThis is NOT the direction that Ontarians want. It is transparently pandering to a small uninformed demographic and intends to benefit Ford\u2019s friends. It is a huge step backwards.\n"

        "comment": "I moved into Toronto in 2011. Initially I had a car and motorcycle and had a paid parking spot in my apartment. After a few months, I realized that it made more sense to commute via bicycle than owning two motor vehicles.\nNow I own 2 bicycles (winter/non-winter) which is the most efficient way to travel across the city. Since 2011 I've had three very minor accidents of being doored by cars that were aware of their surroundings when exiting the vehicle. Had there been bike lanes at the time, it would've been avoided.\nThat is why I'm very thankful for the increased infrastructure for bicycle riders now to keep us safer.\nThe people that are making the decision of removing the bike lanes most likely DON'T LIVE IN THE CITY. Or in the case of our provincial premier, not physically capable of riding one hence he would fight for motorists.\nThe statistics that he pulled saying that 1.2% of people ride bikes is very outdated (circa 1991). Especially with the addition of Bikeshare I'd imagine that number looks VERY DIFFERENT.\n"

It is well known that adding lanes does not meaningfully reduce traffic times for motorists. Bicycle lanes add a level of safety for cyclists, and pedestrians and give newcomers to the growing city a non-motor vehicle-option to get around our large city.\nI do not support the government's proposal to rip up complete streets without adequate consultation or designed options that will replace them and still meet the city's goals.\n"

Study after study has shown not only the POSITIVE economic effects of bike lanes on local neighborhoods but that it REDUCES overall traffic congestion, and improves emergency response times.\nBill 212 ignores all this evidence supporting bike lanes while touting it's goal of reducing traffic congestion. This is absurd.\nFurther, this is a vast over reach of municipal jurisdiction to govern their own affairs. Local planning decisions must be left to their elected officials at the municipality level, and not at the provincial level. I demand the withdrawal of this Bill. We will remember your actions and that of others come next provincial election.\n"

        "comment": "As a concerned resident of Ontario, I'm deeply troubled by the proposed Bill 212, especially its implications for bike lanes in our cities. I've been cycling to work for years, and the recent improvements in bike infrastructure have made my commute safer and more enjoyable. Now, it feels like we're taking a giant step backward.\nI can't help but feel frustrated by the government's shortsightedness. They claim this bill will reduce gridlock, but that's just not how it works. Removing bike lanes doesn't magically make traffic disappear - it just pushes more people into cars, creating even more congestion.\nWhat really gets me is the cost. We're talking about spending at least $48 million to remove bike lanes in Toronto alone. That's our tax money being wasted on destroying infrastructure we just built! As a taxpayer, this feels like a slap in the face. We could be using that money to improve public transit or fix potholes, but instead, we're ripping up perfectly good bike lanes.\nThe safety aspect is what worries me most. I've had too many close calls on roads without proper bike infrastructure. The protected lanes on Bloor Street and Yonge Street have been a game-changer for me and many other cyclists. Removing them puts our lives at risk. It's not just about convenience; it's about our right to safe mobility in our own city.\nI'm also concerned about the precedent this sets. The province overreaching into municipal affairs like this is troubling. Our city councils and planners understand local needs best. They should be the ones making these decisions, not politicians at Queen's Park who might not even cycle or live in the affected areas.\nThe environmental impact can't be ignored either. At a time when we should be encouraging sustainable transportation, this bill does the opposite. It's like we're moving backwards on climate action, which feels incredibly irresponsible.\nI've been talking to my neighbors, cyclists and non-cyclists alike, and we're all planning to voice our opposition during the public comment period. It feels like an uphill battle, but we can't stay silent on this. Our streets, our safety, and our city's future are at stake.\nThis bill isn't just about bike lanes - it's about what kind of cities we want to live in. Do we want vibrant, sustainable communities that prioritize people's safety and well-being? Or do we want to go back to car-centric planning that we know doesn't work? For me, the answer is clear. I just hope our government listens before it's too late.\n"
