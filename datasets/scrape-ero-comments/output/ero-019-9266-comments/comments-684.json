        "comment": "Bill 212 is, by definition, absurd\u2014wildly unreasonable, illogical, and inappropriate. Too many studies and too much information from around the world clearly demonstrate the positive impacts of bike lanes on communities while also demonstrating that bike lanes do not increase traffic congestion. This bill is a complete waste of taxpayer dollars.\nIronically, this bill was proposed by a party named \"Progressive Conservative\" because it was neither progressive nor conservative. Residents of Ontario expected the unnecessary spending to stop, and it has only gotten worse and more trivial.\nThis bill is simply a bad idea from every standpoint. Don't be ignorant.\n"

        "comment": "To whom it may concern,\nReading the proposal details, several comments arise\n- why is the provincial government focusing so intently on Toronto that it has to single out Toronto bike lanes Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue bike lanes in the City of Toronto? The provincial government should be tackling issues that affect the entire province not providing legislation that targets primarily 1 city.\n- providing the province with authority to micromanage municipal issues will remove the autonomy of musically elected leaders and silence the voice of the voters that elected that municipal leader\n- there are many issues requiring large amount of funding, and as a tax payer, it is incredibly disappointing that the government is deciding to spend funds to remove bike lanes where it should be focusing on spending that money on much more important issues such as health care and the housing crisis\n- the proposal details outline the goals of reducing gridlock by removing bike lanes. However, the removal of bike lanes will add more drivers to the road increasing gridlock. Studies show that bike lanes do not significantly affect traffic.\n- removing bike lanes speaks to the governments focus on only the demographic of those who can afford cars, leaving many with little options on how to navigate the city. Cities should be built for all the various populations and studies show this is possible to allow ease of movement throughout the city.\nThis is truly a disappointing proposal that is removing focus and funding from other important issues, and if passed will reduce the confidence the public has with the Ontario government as it shows the government will do anything in its power to control the decisions made in Toronto, though there are many more cities and people that make Ontario.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 will only increase cycling deaths/injuries, discourage cycling when the use of bicycles is on the rise, and cause taxpayers millions of dollars in unnecessary costs. The province is not more equipped than the City of Toronto to make these kinds of decisions for Toronto residents. The Minister of Transportation and Premier are out of order in creating and rushing this bill.\nWe want people to cycle instead of cars; for their own safety, health, and for the environment. Why would the province be encouraging unsafe roads? Why is the province bullying their way into overruling city decisions? Why would citizens want to go back 10-20 years with multiple congested lanes, and more cars on the road without room and security for cyclists? We don't! If anything, we should be encouraging  the use of cyclist and fuel-free methods of getting to work and moving around cities.\nI absolutely oppose Bill 212.\n"

Cycling via bike lanes is therefore the fastest way for me to get around the city, such as commuting to work and meeting up with friends. These typical 10km cycling trips take twice as long via TTC, and would be made far slower and more dangerous if you remove the major bike lanes. Toronto should be adding more bike lanes to encourage this cheap and health mode of transportation.\n"

Most of the time, biking on streets with bike lanes are the fastest way to get to work and school. Bike lanes are getting undeserved blame for the many factors that contribute to gridlock including increased car volume due to ride-sharing, lane closures due to condo development, and street upgrades. Help keep children and families safe by keeping bike lanes in Toronto! Your Toronto voters thank you!\n"

I see many parents with trailers attached to the back of their bike, taking their children to daycare or school. Daily. Cars are too expensive for most families in the GTA, not counting parking and time wasted in traffic. The people in power need to stop receiving money from big car industries and think about what's best for the community.\n"

        "comment": "Instead of making room for more cars in the downtown core, people should be incentivizedto take alternative forms of transit in and out of the city (I.e. public transit, bike share, car share). This would reduce emissions produced and also decrease noise pollution. Cars that drive into the city could be taxed and that money could be used to further improve the transit systems. This would make the city safer and more affordable for everyone and benefit the environment and people's well being as well.\n"

        "comment": "I will say that if the Government of Ontario is set on reducing congestion that the bike lanes to stop are the ones that are in the planning stage. For example, the addition of bike lanes to Parkside Drive will make congestion so much worse. As one of the few roads that connects Black Creek to the Gardiner and Lakeshore - the road that Gord Perks calls the most dangerous street in the city... he has plans to forever alter that road system and it absolutely cause traffic congestion.\nAs a person who lives on an adjoining road, add bike lanes to Indian Road and keep the cars on the fast road and keep the bikes, pedestrians and scooters on the cross roads (at lights) and on the residential road, let the bikes flow.\nIt makes no sense to remove what is there... but it may make sense to slow down the approval of new bike lanes where there is really no problem.\n"

Why would we want to pay more money to remove perfectly good bike lanes that already costed however much money to put in the first place. Adding more lanes for car traffic has been proven time and again that it does not improve traffic. How about we spend money on things that will actually lessen traffic like public transit, instead of cutting funding for transit (which is an essential service for poor people, unhoused people, disabled people, youth and elderly, and so many more.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 ignores the fundamental issue that the majority of people in Toronto / GTA do not have sufficient means to get to and from work across the city. Providing another car lane does not solve the needs of thousands of lives. It provides the privileged few (with cars) more access to more lanes. Bikers will continue to bike because it is the most effective way to get anywhere in this terribly planned city. Bikers are not the problem. This bill encourages the mentality that cars are more important than anyone else in the built environment, when in reality it is the pedestrian. Over the last 5 decades cities in Scandinavia, the UK, the USA, and Mexico, to name a few, have realized this mentality is backwards and detrimental to the lives of their inhabitants. They have committed to prioritizing a new framework for transit, one that increases health, community life and mental health. This long term vision is needed here, to create a place that is a refuge instead of a sterile dumpster. If this Bill is approved there will be an increase of death amongst bikers, and it will be because a government has encouraged their death, and nothing else.\n"

        "comment": "When speaking about bike lanes, a mayoral candidate video regarding bike lanes on University Ave. clearly showed that what was delaying traffic was not the bike lanes but a large construction site outside of ROM.\nToday, as I was cycling along Bloor Street downtown, construction took over the entire eastbound lanes between St George and Avenue Road, resulting in a massive traffic jam that had nothing to do with bike lanes.\nThe primary traffic jam that occurred under the Gardiner caused significant delays. Cars blocking the intersection cause major delays, vehicles running the red lights cause delays, and traffic lights that are so close together slow down traffic. This stretch has been under constant construction for the last two years, leading to significant delays.\nThe articles below discuss Toronto's congestion issue, but none of them discuss how bike lanes contribute to that issue.\n"

Too many of us have already lost loved ones and/or suffered injuries as a result of careless drivers who are in a rush or experiencing road rage.\nThe province should be focused on reducing congestion by reducing reliance on vehicles. Investing in active transportation will encourage people to use other modes of transport than cars and ultimately result in citizens who are happier and healthier, both physically and mentally, and lead to health care-related savings.\n"

        "comment": "Dear Premier Ford,\nI urgently ask you to reconsider Bill 212. Removing bike lanes on Bloor, Yonge, and University will not make traffic flow better. It will hurt small businesses and quite literally lead to deaths of cyclists. Is that something you want? I imagine the answer is of course not.\nMayor Olivia Chow has denounced the bill as well. I do not understand why a provincial premier feels the need to meddle in the business of municipal affairs like this, especially when it's related to just a few bike lanes?\nBike lanes save lives. They are important parts of a city. By removing them, we are moving backward in society. We need to be more like Europe, not less, when it comes to city building. Cars are NOT king and car-centric design does not help the flow of people within a city. Surely you can understand that many, many people rely on bike lanes to get to where they need to go.\nFurthermore, Toronto has only recently put in these bike lanes. Removing them will cost MILLIONS of dollars. To be a Conservative premier means that you want to abandon reckless spending, right? Well, leave them where they are, please.\nIf I am forced to bike on the road where a bike lane once was, I will commit to cycling right in the middle of the road. We will see how that fairs with drivers.\nFor further reading, please read this study: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L1YzYJA--Yz0rIsGifP95RbzDNYTuqdf/view\n"
