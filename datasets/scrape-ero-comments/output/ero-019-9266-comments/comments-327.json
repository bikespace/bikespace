        "comment": "The cycling infrastructure developed throughout Toronto has been a beacon of progress in a very tough time. Removing them would not only be a waste of money, but it compromises a healthier, safer city for all residents. Studies show that adding more lanes for cars INCREASES gridlock by convincing more people to drive. We need to get more people out of their cars and onto transit or in bike lanes, which can move far more people more efficiently. Bikes are also zero carbon transport, not hard on infrastructure, and support the local economy, and promote active lifestyle and lower stress (all of which are good for people and the province's health care costs). Bike lanes also provide the lowest cost transportation option in a time when rates of poverty and food insecurity are rising.\nFurther, having clearly marked areas for cyclists makes the road safer for ALL users, including pedestrians and drivers. The roads of Toronto are already dotted with too many ghost bike memorials, and the premier's plan to remove safe, reliable cycling infrastructure will cost more people their lives. I am happy to lose a couple minutes of convenience if it saves lives.\nAs an occasional driver, I will say it can be inefficient to drive across the city: it SHOULD be. While cars are sometimes necessary, when faced with a climate crisis we need more people out of their cars, and if we can achieve that, everyone stands to benefit.\nThe province should stop interfering with a municipal decision that affects lives here in Toronto.\n"

Removing the bike lines would do a significant disservice to people who can't afford cars and don't have other means to get around the city. It also poses a huge public safety risk.

In addition,  the removal of existing bike lanes will worsen congestion, as everyone sits through the traffic that will surely be caused by this unnecessary work. Instead of wasting time, money and energy with this idiotic proposal, why not look at removing parking from high traffic arteries? Oh, that's right Doug's nonexistent #waroncars. While you're at it, remind Doug that he's not the mayor of Toronto, but premiere of this province and should be focused on improving Healthcare, mental health services, social services and all those other things under his purview.  Forget the bike lanes and leave city business to the city you absolute morons in the PC party.\n"

        "comment": "As a regular driver, transit user, resident of the affected area and also cyclist I strongly object to the proposed process of requiring provincial approval for most bike lane installations as well as the forced removal of bike lanes on Bloor St, University Ave and Yonge St.\nRequiring provincial approval for bike lane installations is a serious overreach by the provincial government and a disenfranchisement of municipal voters. Cities are best positioned to decide how to design their streets for the needs of their residents. By interfering in this process, the province is taking away a crucial municipal core competency, adding red tape and worsening quality of life for all residents of Ontario. The people of each municipality deserve to decide themselves what their city or town should look like.\nThe stated reasons for this intervention do not stand up to scrutiny: there is no credible evidence that bike lanes contribute meaningfully to traffic congestion. Traffic congestion in Toronto is extreme mostly in places that do not have bike lanes such as Lakeshore and Jarvis.\nArguments that emergency vehicles are blocked and local businesses suffer have been conclusively disproven. All emergency services have e.g. stated that response times on Bloor St have not worsened since installation of the bike lanes and Bloor Annex BIA has come out as strongly against removal of the lanes and stated that they contribute to business.\nAnother argument is that bike lanes should be installed on secondary streets instead. However, there are not contiguous routes on most secondary streets, so alternatives are either not possible at all or would add considerable distance to the route. Cyclists' destinations such as their work, school, shops or restaurants are also mostly located on major streets, so building bike lanes on residential streets will often not respond adequately to demand. Secondly, there have also been major objections in the past to bike lane projects on side streets, such as the recent project in Parkdale.\nThe addendum to the proposed bill is even worse. The suggestion is that the province should order, without study or consultation, the removal of a number of successful and popular bike lanes after a democratic process spanning in each case many months or years, multiple public consultations, surveys, revisions and in each case a vote by a majority of city council. Each of these projects have been approved with large majorities in city council and anti-bike lane candidates have mostly lost their candidacies in recent municipal and mayoral elections.\nTherefore, I therefore urge the provincial legislature to reject the proposed legislation and continue the proven practice of allowing municipalities to plan and implement their local road infrastructure according to the will of their electorate and their local needs.\n"

        "comment": "I\u2019m writing to oppose the proposed plan to restrict and remove bike lanes in Toronto. Removing bike lanes on major streets like Bloor, Yonge, and University is counterproductive and a misuse of taxpayer money. Not only is there no clear evidence that bike lanes cause gridlock, but they actually reduce traffic by giving people a safe alternative to driving.\nThis proposal also ignores the environmental benefits of cycling. Bike lanes support a greener city by cutting down emissions and improving air quality\u2014critical goals as we combat climate change. Additionally, studies show that bike lanes make streets safer and promote better health by encouraging active transportation.\nRemoving existing bike infrastructure sets Ontario back on its sustainability goals and wastes money already invested in infrastructure we need. I urge you to keep and expand our bike lanes, not remove them. Finally, cities worldwide are investing in and expanding bike lanes as a future-forward approach to urban planning. Toronto has made considerable progress in establishing itself as a city that values active transportation and urban sustainability. Reversing these advancements would be a step backward for Ontario\u2019s reputation and influence as a progressive region on the world stage.\nFeel free to view this article by the CBC if you want more evidence, as well as one by TVO https://www.cbc.ca/news/science/bike-lanes-impacts-1.7358319\nhttps://www.tvo.org/article/debunking-three-big-myths-about-bike-lanes\n"

        "comment": "I live near Bloor st, and I take the Bloor, Yonge, and University bike lines regularly. This bill is a travesty. Bike lanes DO NOT cause congestion. Cars cause congestion. When you provide safe and appealing alternatives to driving, fewer people drive. Better bike lanes and better public transit make driving better for people who need to drive. I recognize that not everybody can bike, but it's about providing safe alternatives. People will be killed directly because of this legislation, I promise you that. Please reconsider, this is foolish, backwards, and not remotely evidence based.\n"

        "comment": "First off, this is the dumbest name for an act ever.\nSecond, bike lanes reduce car traffic. They increase foot traffic to local business, and help reduce the emissions from single occupancy vehicles.\nThird, the 401 has no bike lanes and is still congested. Maybe it's not the bike lanes?\nSingle occupancy cars cause traffic. They cause transit to be slow and use a ton of road space. We should reduce the amount of space they have available to them for driving and parking. Driving a single occupancy vehicle in downtown Toronto is stupid and should be painful. Riding a bike or taking transit is smart and should be easy and not slower because our premier and his buddies want to be driven to Timmies.\nLeave the bike lanes alone, fund  transit, and enforce no parking/stopping restrictions and tow cars parked in bike lanes\n"

        "comment": "I live in the Annex and work downtown. I bike to work everyday, including through the winter, except on days when there is a lot of snow on the roads (which are minimal). I just the Bloor and University bike lanes daily, and the lanes on Yonge fairly regularly as well. I have been commuting by bike in Toronto since 2012, and the improvements for the infrastructure have made biking much safer in the city. I have also notice a significant uptick in the number of people biking in Toronto over the last decade or so. It seems evident - and I assume is backed up by data - that improved infrastructure will result in more bikers. Hard to see why this would be a bad thing. This policy will discourage bikers and put those who continue to bike in greater danger. The benefits seem marginal, at best. It should not be implemented.\n"

        "comment": "It is absolutely absurd in this era of climate change and economic uncertainty to remove existing bike lanes. Interfering with municipalities' ability to determine their owk bike lane needs is bad enough, but to spend taxpayer money removing lanes on Bloor, etc.? Absurd. And a conflict of interest, given some of the lanes' proximity to Doug Ford's home. We need to encourage alternate forms of transport, not make them more dangerous. It's embarrassing that a government would even propose removing bike lanes when you consider the cost and effort, not to mention the negative message and result. Perhaps visit some public schools and have a look at how far that money could go and how much children care about making choices not centred on a handful of drivers in Etobicoke.\n"

It takes longer than ever to drive to them, and there are no good transit alternatives to get there.\nBut one thing that has made my commute better is This city\u2019s bike lanes. I can take the streetcar to work, which takes 45-50 minutes. Or I can drive, which can take 21 minutes if I leave early or up to 40 minutes during peak rush hour.\nMy bike commute to work, every time, no matter what, is 20 minutes using bike lanes.\nBike lanes work. They make life better for us residents of Toronto. And the province should not be coming in and harming Toronto residents by removing something we voted for. It\u2019s anti-democratic and bad decision-making. And we\u2019ve had too much of that in this province in recent years.\n"

        "comment": "I am a daily commuter cyclist in Toronto - to work, for groceries, and everything else. The bicycle is the most efficient and quickest mode of transport downtown. This is an incredibly dangerous piece of legislation for cyclists, and will do absolutely nothing for congestion on the roads of Toronto. My wife is a nurse on University Row, and the removal of any part of the University bike lane below College Street makes her commute (and the commutes of thousands of others) to work more dangerous.\nThere is no validity to any of the claims made by the Transport Minister or the Premier regarding bike lanes, in fact, studies from around the world show that bike lanes actually reduce congestion by getting people out of their cars. If the Premier actually cared about congestion, the government would be encouraging bike lane construction, allowing congestion pricing, and really investing in transit. How about opening the Eglinton and Finch LRT lines soon?\nOur roads are increasingly dangerous with aggressive driving, and any attempts to speed up auto traffic in the city's core will just magnify the danger to cyclists, pedestrians, the disabled, and children. The city is our home, not a thoroughfare for suburban commuters.\nRest assured, the people of the city and other Ontario cities will oppose any attempt to remove even one metre of protected bike lanes, just like we fought your outrageous plans for the Greenbelt. We won't forget this.\nSincerely,\nRyan\nDavenport, Toronto\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose the proposal for Bill 212. As Guelph residents, our household relies on driving, public transit, cycling, and walking to get around. Where we experience gridlock in its worst form is on the eastbound 401 as we go to visit family in Toronto. This is not the fault of bike lanes, but of too many vehicles on the road. In a perfect world, we would be able to take the GO Train between Guelph and Toronto for these visits, but no trains currently run on weekends forcing us to become yet another car on the 401.\nCity streets are not highways, and lower speed limits and safe cycling/pedestrian infrastructure plays a key role in protecting residents of Ontario, especially members of vulnerable populations. Removing heavily used cycling infrastructure in Toronto at the cost of tax payers across the province is an irresponsible misuse of funds. The lives of vulnerable road users are more important than a marginally faster commute for a small subset of the population.\n"

Endangering people who commute and earn a living on bicycles.\n2. Further impede traffic with all the construction to remove the bike lanes.\n3.

        "comment": "Impact on Local Autonomy: Municipalities generally have the most direct knowledge of local transportation needs and community priorities. This proposal could add layers of bureaucracy that may hinder timely implementation of bicycle infrastructure. Empowering municipalities to make these decisions locally, in line with provincial safety standards, could better address unique local contexts.\nSafety and Sustainable Mobility: The Ministry\u2019s mandate to review whether a bike lane would \u201cunduly diminish\u201d motor vehicle traffic flow might inadvertently prioritize vehicle capacity over active transportation. Given Ontario\u2019s goals of promoting sustainable, safe, and inclusive transportation networks, considering bicycle lanes as an essential part of infrastructure that supports public health and reduces congestion may be beneficial. This focus would align with the province\u2019s commitment to reducing carbon emissions and encourage active transportation.\nEfficiency and Resources: Requiring Ministry approval could potentially delay projects, increasing costs for municipalities and deterring smaller jurisdictions from investing in cycling infrastructure. Additionally, municipalities may need to redirect resources to meet new reporting requirements, which could strain budgets and affect other transportation projects.\nClarity on Standards and Transitional Provisions: The proposed \u201ctransition\u201d provision allowing projects already underway to proceed is a positive step. However, more clarity on the specific criteria the Ministry will use to assess applications and the regulatory processes involved would help municipalities plan accordingly. Establishing clear and measurable criteria for both approval and review of existing lanes would create transparency and consistency in decision-making.\n"

        "comment": "Please do not make it more difficult to build bike lanes in municipalities across the province, and, please do not get rid of parts of the Bloor, Yonge and University bike lanes in Toronto. I used the Bloor bike lane every day to take my three-year to daycare. It is essential. Without it, I would be terrified of navigating such a busy street with my young child, especially in light of the record number of cyclists deaths in Toronto this year, including one on Bloor. The lanes mean we don't have to drive to daycare, and I'm sure for many families and others like us, that means one fewer car on the road and it helps ease vehicular traffic! As the Bloor BIA and others have noted, the Bloor lane is also actually go for business as cyclists, like myself, stop to shop along the corridor, whereas motorists are simply passing through. We'll pickup groceries in our bike trailer at the many fruit markets along Bloor on the return from daycare. Because the lanes are also on a main street, they're part of regular snow clearing in the winter! Which means we use them year-round. Yes! Year-round to take our child to daycare. Whereas side streets are often left unplowed our contra-flow lanes get filled with snow that becomes hard-packed ice and they become extremely dangerous! Please, listen to the people of Toronto, not those simply passing through. This is our city and the bike lanes make daily life safer, more efficient, more environmentally-friendly, healthy and beautiful.\n"
