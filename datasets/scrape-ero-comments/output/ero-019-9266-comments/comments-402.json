        "comment": "The provincial government should not be interfering with municipal planning decisions on local bike infrastructure. The Ontario government\u2019s proposal to give itself a veto on municipal decisions in this regard ignores the authority and trust that the public has given to elected municipal leaders to make plans and decisions on local infrastructure that are in the best interest of the local community.\nThe threat/proposal to remove existing bike infrastructure in Toronto is also a narrow-minded, backward thinking move. People need protected cycling infrastructure in order to get to places for different purposes. Otherwise where else are people - including children-  supposed to cycle? Roads are not only for motor vehicles - and I say this as someone who both drives and cycles. The proposal to remove protected bike lanes would make cyclists less safe and discourage more people from cycling. It seems that the premier is not interested in the safety of the cycling community. Not everyone can afford a car, nor want a car. The decision to discourage cycling seems like a very elitist move that prioritized people who own cars. Bike lanes do not contribute to congestion: cars create congestion - a situation only made worse by  the increasing numbers of cars on the road. Stop this false narrative of a war between car drivers and cyclists.\n"

        "comment": "I use bike lanes every day, and by removing them I would no longer feel safe taking my younger brothers to the nearby park. It is a commute of around 3 km, and there are, thankfully, bike lanes the majority of the way (even if they are somewhat unsafe, still having conflict with pedestrians). What I am already feeling right now is that I have to put up with pedestrians on the path, fine. But 4000 pound steel monstrosities?\nI will still bike.\nIt doesn't matter.\nBut if I am on the road, ahead to cars speeding well over 30km/h over the speed limit, how will they feel, having to (almost) stop?\nWill this really help traffic? I think NOT.\nWhy should polluters get priority anyways?\nWhy should those who drive get priority?\nWhy should we spend billions on drivers?\nWhy should we give cars with only one (1.5) person(s) priority (over one person on a bike taking up way less road space)?\n"

The provincial government does not have the knowledge that local people or business partners know. Tell me where Brockville is with out having to look it up. If you can do that then maybe you should have an influence on how we plan for our local needs. If not then why should we have to come to you with our proposal. It's more red tape, and hoops to go through. More government, for someone who says they want to simplify government.\n"

Aside from just myself directly they make it easier for delivery services to work, and make it possible for teens to be more independent.\nClaiming that Ontario \"Recognizes the need to build priority highways faster as our province grows in order to get people and goods out of gridlock and save drivers and businesses time and money.\" and then actively forcing people into cars and causing gridlock doesn't make any sense. Business goes up when people go by on foot or bike because it's easier to just stop in when a shop looks interesting.\nThen saying that Ontario \"Recognizes that accidents and lane closures can worsen traffic congestion and impact the quality of life of Ontarians.\" with the solution of removing road safety features has to be an actual joke, right?\nThis bill will neither reduce gridlock or save me time. All it will do is increase gridlock and make my life harder...\nThis bill is entirely counter-productive!\n"

You're insisting on stuffing downtown Toronto with many more people, and only think they're going to jump onto the subway to move around.  That is sheer lunacy.  The bike infrastructure, full or otherwise, is an invite to reassess travel within the city, and provides one that's already paid for.\n"

        "comment": "These bike lanes are vital for several important reasons\n1. Safety for Cyclists: Removing bike lanes would endanger cyclists by forcing them to share the road with vehicles, increasing the risk of accidents and injuries.\n2. Encouraging Sustainable Transportation: Bike lanes support cycling as a clean and efficient mode of transportation. Their removal undermines efforts to promote environmentally friendly commuting options.\n3. Public Health and Wellness: Cycling is an excellent form of exercise. Maintaining bike lanes encourages more residents to adopt healthier lifestyles, reducing the community\u2019s overall health risks.\n4. Traffic Congestion: Bike lanes help alleviate road congestion by providing an alternative to car travel. Their removal could lead to increased traffic and longer commute times for all.\n5. Community Support and Engagement: Many residents have embraced cycling as a viable form of transportation. Removing bike lanes disregards the needs and preferences of a growing segment of our community.\n6. Economic Impact: Studies show that bike-friendly communities can attract tourists and support local businesses. Maintaining bike lanes can contribute to our local economy.\nWe urge our provincial government to prioritize the safety and well-being of all residents by preserving existing bike lanes. Please consider the long-term benefits of maintaining these vital infrastructure components for a sustainable and healthy community.\nThank you for your attention to this important matter. Together, we can advocate for a safer and more sustainable community.\n"

        "comment": "As a member of the City of Kitchener's Committee of Adjustment and an Architecture/Urbanism Graduate from Carleton University, I strongly oppose the provincial government involving itself in street design decisions.\nI use my bike regularly for errands, commuting, and it serves as my primary form of transportation. The plain truth is that protected bike lanes featuring a physical barrier between cyclists and cars save lives, and I personally hold a poor opinion of anyone who places the convenience of drivers over the physical safety of pedestrians and cyclists.\nThis legislation is not only bad for business - dutch planners have found a roughly 800% return on investment when building bicycle infrastructure - but it also shows clearly that the province cares more about having our roads clogged with cars than my personal safety when I am on my bike. I would much prefer that the province focus on the present cost of living crisis, housing, healthcare, and education, than waste everyone's time interfering with municipal processes.\n"

        "comment": "I live in Toronto, work downtown, and use the cities bike infrastructure daily. Although there have been excellent improvements to that infrastructure over the past few years, my daily commute still follows a snake-like path due to incomplete infrastructure forcing me to either ride on main roads among cars, or take a much longer route to ride safely. I've seen many comments claiming that they don't see bike infrastructure being used on corridors such as Eglinton, which fail to recognize that cyclists might be wary to use incomplete infrastructure that has no connections and will unexpectedly dump them back into increasingly hostile traffic.\nWith Toronto's ever growing population, and the fact that we are staring down the barrel of anthropogenic climate change, we need to recognize that assuming everyone can and will drive simply will not work. The city needs cyclists to alleviate gridlock, because someeone deciding to bike does not contribute to traffic in the same way that someone deciding to drive does. The more people who choose to take alternate forms of transport such as biking or transit (including those who bikeshare to their transit connection), the quicker and more efficiently those who do need to use a car are able to move. Given this, and the countless studies which show that the addition of lanes do not relieve congestion, it's foolish that the Ford government would want to remove bike lanes simply because Doug gets annoyed on his commute to downtown.\nThe premier should align himself with his own purported principles of small government, and allow municipalities to quickly and dynamically respond to their traffic needs without interfering and introducing unnecessary red tape.\nI, for one, can assure the premier that should the bike lanes be removed from corridors such as Bloor, Yonge, and University, he'll be sitting in his car wishing for bike lanes, because many of us who cycle won't simply stop because there isn't infrastructure. Personally, I don't own a car because I can't afford the (on average) 16,500 dollars per year is costs to own a car. He can look forward to me trying my best not to block the traffic that he will be forcing me to join.\nAs a quick note, I just want to tack on a couple facts that Doug might not be aware of, or has chosen to willfully ignore.\n1. Taking into account all of the environmental, infrastructure, and health costs of cars, driving has been shown to be a net cost to society at large. One that I, despite not driving, have been dutifully paying. Conversely, biking has been shown to be of a net benefit to society at large. Bikers are more likely to stop at local businesses, the infrastructure costs of maintaining bike lanes are much lower due to weight, and biking yields to improved health outcomes for both the biker and those around them.\n2. Premier Ford tried to be the mayor of Toronto and lost the election. He should respect the decision of the people of Toronto.\n3. People see nobody in a bike lane and assume it is unused, but fail to recognize that cyclists not only do not contribute to traffic, they also aren't stuck in it. We don't wait around waiting to be seen.\n4. Wider roads and more lanes cause drivers to perceive the road as being safer (for the driver), and to drive quicker. This increases the danger to everyone, as speed is the biggest predictor of whether someone hit by a car will survive or not.\nI'd like to suggest that Doug tries biking to work a couple times, to see what cyclists in Toronto are already contending with. Perhaps then he might recognize that putting us further into jeopardy is not a solution to anyone's problems.\n"

Making safe, connected and effective bike lanes is a hallmark of great cities. The suburanization of our small towns and big cities offers a planning model that puts cars first and people second. Cleaner air, safer roadways, improved health are all part of smart urban design that make cities that adopt integrated transportation networks, including well designed bike lanes, great.\nI've been in cities designed for people. They are truly world class. I've been in cities that prioritize cars. They are utilitarian and unwelcoming.\nThis shouldn't be a \"culture\" issue but one of choice. Choice, a thing that used to be a conservative value. Much like fiscal responsibility, competition and merit, things that are disappearing in this version of Ontario.\nPer the Globe and Mail, a new car in Ontario now costs more than $64,807. This is 78% of the average post tax household income in Ontario. That's assuming a young family can afford a house in this Brave New Ontario.\nThe Ontario government should be focused on creating a great place for people, not government cronies and cars.\n"

Bike lanes are an investment in communities and make areas more desirable to live and work. People who use bike lanes are also taxpayers, commuters, shoppers, etc. Why are we making it more difficult to use alternate modes of transportation? Not everyone can afford a car. Not everyone is able to drive a car. We should as a province be encouraging people to use alternate forms of transportation. Less cars on the road means less traffic and gridlock. Less cars means less money spent on road infrastructure upkeep. Invest in bikes lanes and public transportation. Remove unnecessary parking on major streets if gridlock is actually a concern. Encourage people to use public transit. Removing bikes lanes solves nothing and makes the roads unsafe for all users.\n"
