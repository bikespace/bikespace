Bike-lanes make me feel safe, protected from traffic (car and pedestrian). Moreover, in the current climate crisis, it's an ecological and environmental nonsense to consider removing them.\n"

        "comment": "This bill seems poorly thought out and a waste of time and money.\nCities already pour so many resources into planning the city. Why should the province begin weighing in on how the bike lanes look when said resources could be better directed to something that actually benefits taxpayers in the long run such as better investment in medical care, schools, support programs etc.\nTaxpayers are paying more and more out of pocket every day for essentials like medication, as well as having to step in and cover costs for elderly or disabled relatives, and instead of supporting then in way that matters the ontario government seems to prefer investing in redundancies and buzzword projects.\n"

        "comment": "As a transportation engineer, I would like to support various points identified by many professional associations and explain why Bill 212 should NOT be approved as is. Bill 212 does not clarify what criteria will be used to approve or disapprove the installation of bike facilities and in what moment of the Cities planning process the provincial assessment will occur. It should be noted that the decision to install a bike lane is made many year before the actual design process even starts through Cities' Transportation Master Plan and Official Plan, which align with the City values and long term goals.\nBesides the lack of details of how and when the provincial evaluation would occur, the Bill does not present any evidence to the statement that bike lanes increase congestions in urban areas. Although it might \"feel like\" it does, such an important decision cannot be made based on \"feelings\" and the Bill cannot pass without supporting scientific research and observation. On the contrary, there are innumerous academic materials supported by evidence showing that bike lanes actually reduce traffic congestions. As I have not seen professional groups breaking down the reasons fort that, I wanted to explain why this occurs in a didactic way. Due to the induced-demand phenomenon, in dense areas like urban cities, the wider the roadway is, the higher the traffic volume will be. When you remove a bike lane from a busy road, it will not take long for that space to be occupied by motor vehicles as people will need to go to their destinations (only using a different mode). And if a road does not have a bike lane yet and is not yet congested, it is just a matter of time for congestion to occur as the population grows around it.\nIn urban areas, short to medium distance trips represent the majority of daily trips (to grocery shops, schools and to the closest transit station or work). Bikes are mostly used in short to medium distances and they are an efficient alternative to reach those destinations, specially when roads are congested. The majority of people does not use bicycles if there are no safe facilities to separate them from motor vehicles. That is why bike lanes are crucial to provide a transportation option to people who want to avoid congestions or cannot drive for any reason. The more connected the cycling network is and the safer the cycling facilities are, the more people will prefer to ride to their destinations. Bikes are the second most flexible and efficient mode of transportation (after cars) and in congested areas, it becomes the most efficient mode as bike lanes accommodate many more people than cars in the same given area (specially as most cars carry only 1 to 2 people in daily trips). That is why cities around the world are implementing more and more cycling facilities: that is the MOST EFFICIENT transportation mode in urban areas. Besides that, bicycles are sometimes the only option to people that cannot afford or buy a car.\nIt should also be noted that before the implementation of any cycling facility, transportation professionals develop feasibility studies that does consider the impact of such facility to existing and future traffic volumes and not a single cycling facility is installed if it is expected to make a traffic that operates well to fail. If the traffic is failing in a road with a bike like, it is because the traffic would fail anyway without the bike lane.\nI understand that Premier Ford wants to address complaints about traffic congestion, but removing bike lanes from roads or preventing them from being installed for the reasons presented in the Bill 212 will only make congestions worse and he will lose a huge number of supporters because of that. He will be forever remembered for being the Premier who delayed transportation progress and deteriorated the transportation system. I am not even mentioning the negative impacts to road safety, equity and community building that Bill 212 will cause in my comment to not make it even longer. I ask the Parliament and the Committee to NOT approve the Bill 212 for all the reasons mentioned above.\n"

        "comment": "The decision to restrict and remove bike lanes in Toronto is not a fact based decision and will not help gridlock but rather contribute to more traffic and potentially more gridlock as cyclists take to driving in car lanes. The real cause of most traffic delays is construction projects . Developers are unreasonably allowed to take up public space on roadways ( and sidewalks and bike lanes )for far too long as they build their projects which should be mostly staying on  their private properties . Often the public road ways are blocked by orange cones in front of and beyond  these construction projects seemingly just to allow the workers to park their vehicles on public property. It would be a much more effective solution to address gridlock if the Province and the City worked together to minimize the blockage of roadways for these construction projects only where it was absolutely essential and for as short a period of time as possible and that there be active enforcement of these blockages where the developer spreads down the street with their orange cones unnecessarily. These construction blockages for private developments are costing the City and taxpayers millions of dollars for time lost caused by gridlock yet very little revenue is recovered from the private developer for use of public space . There should be very high charges levied  for everyday public space is blocked by these developers  ( and for every foot of space that is blocked )which will incentivize these developers to shorten the time and the area that is blocked but them . Bike lanes are not the real problem as most people know . Really just  a vote grab .\n"

        "comment": "This legislation undermines local decision-making and ignores the long-term benefits of investing in cycling infrastructure.\nBike lanes encourage active transportation, REDUCE traffic congestion, improve air quality, and create SAFER streets for EVERYONE. Safe cycling infrastructure also supports local businesses because cars do not shop, people shop. People walking and cycling are more likely to make a spontaneous decision to go into a store they see along the route as it is more convenient for them to stop and enter stores. Safe cycling infrastructure also enables kids who can't drive or people who need to use mobility scooters to safely travel independently. This bill also ignores growing public support for safer roads and sustainable transportation.\nMore viable alternatives to driving reduces congestion. Giving cars more space historically has not improved congestion, and will not improve congestion.\n112 pedestrians and cyclists have been killed and 5545 pedestrians and cyclists have been injured in collisions with vehicles in Ontario in 2023. Help cities make their roads safer instead of restricting them.\nWe urge the government to reconsider this short-sighted approach and instead support policies that promote sustainable and equitable transportation options for all Ontarians.\nSTOP THE MURDER.\n"

It is completely unfathomable how this legislation is being debated thinking you are solving traffic problems when all the bill will do is literally make the problem worse.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose this bill and fear for my own safety and the safety of my children if it is passed. It is a clear overreach into municipal issues and does nothing to touch the underlying causes of congestion. All good evidence suggests that it will only increase congestion in the longterm while endangering cyclists, wasting money, increasing emissions during a climate crisis and hurting businesses along the Bloor, Yonge and University corridors. I do not drive and rely on transit, walking and cycling to get to work, bring my children to school, go shopping, visit family and friends - for everything. It sickens me that this provincial government would choose theoretically slightly reducing the driving time for a few people over my safety and my children's safety. This bill will cause injuries, this bill will cause more cyclists to lose their lives. If the province would like to reduce congestion, increased investment in rapid transit throughout the region is critical, as well as making ALTERNATIVES to driving such as CYCLING safe and efficient for all members of the public, including young people and elderly people. Investing is cycling and other active transportation infrastructure is also a powerful investment into public health (with inactivity being hugely costly for the province in healthcare costs).\nI am also deeply concerned about the province's attempt to exempt Highway 413 from the Greenbelt Plan and Environmental Assessment Act as well as Ontario's Provincial Planning Statement. This egregious and reckless plan again fails to ensure the health and safety of future generations and will not resolve the issue of congestion! I am so ashamed to live in this province right now.\n"

I use bike because I can save money, get exercise and it's faster. it necessary to provide bike infrastructure (protected bike lanes) to make bicycle commute safe. otherwise (as this Bill is trying to dismantle) all bicycle commuter will opt out of using bike and bring out their cars for any short or long commute. what is next? even more traffic on street, not only you have not reduced the traffic you added to it. we need to make bike commute as safe as possible for people to leave their car and use more bikes. this way you definitely have less  cars and better traffic flow. it's inhuman to endanger bicycle commuters lives just to make drivers go faster.\n"

As both a cyclist and a driver I have noticed ZERO difference in commute times as a driver on streets with bike lanes and as a cyclist I can move around faster and more safely.\nGridlock occurs on the 401 and Gardiner and just about any road WITHOUT bike lanes (and is usually due to conveys of transport trucks or poorly planned construction - like when they block lanes with cones for NO REASON).\nBike lanes are the least of our worries in this city. As a cyclist I feel safer using bike lanes and will leave my car at home often when I'm going some place accessible by a bike lane - taking a car - my car -off the road.\nWhen you build a bike lane it fills up with bikes.\nWith the e-scooter revolution and more and more people buying those we need more bike lanes not fewer!\nMany of those people on bikes are not driving and would be driving if they couldn't safely use their bikes.\nBike lanes take cars off the road!\nSpend our tax dollars on co-ordinating construction in this city or on forcing trucks to use the 407 or on cops to stop people from blocking the box or parking wherever they want at rush hour and leave bikes and bike lanes alone.\n"
