        "comment": "I'm very disappointed by and in strong opposition to the direction the administration is choosing to go on this issue. Giving people direct and safe ways to bike around instead of driving is one of the few ways to actually address the root causes of traffic congestion. Focusing on removing alternatives to driving will not improve congestion. When bike routes are unsafe (no protected lanes) or made significantly longer unnecessarily (moving bike lanes to side streets only) less people will choose to bike and more people that choose to cycle will die. These effects will ensure that more people choose to drive directly resulting in more cars on the road increasing traffic congestion. This has been studied thoroughly all over the globe and, for the current administration to blatantly disregard the data and decide that \"welp if it hasn't worked anywhere else surely it'll work here\" demonstrates their lack of vision for the future of this province and utter contempt for the working people of Ontario. As an aside exempting highways from environmental assessments is also a very short sighted and crude choice. As a young working professional who enjoys the health benefits of biking to and from work this policy choice really makes me question my future in this province.\n"

        "comment": "This will increase cyclist injuries and deaths, will do nothing to speed up traffic or reduce congestion, and will impact thousands of torontonians who choose to cycle. Countless research shows that bike infrastructure GETS PEOPLE OFF THE ROADS which DECREASES TRAFFIC AND CONGESTION. Cars ARE traffic. Not bikes. Not streetcars. Not buses. Cars.  The only thing that will reduce congestion in a meaningful way is improved alternative forms of transit like bike infra and public transit. This bill is incredibly dangerous and will set Toronto back decades. We will not stand for it.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are a vital piece of infrastructure that provides a safe, green, and active way of transportation in a city with limited options for those without cars. I live in the west end of downtown with no subway access and no car. I rely on my bike to commute and have only felt safe enough to bike with bike lanes recently installed. Removal and cancellation of future bike lines will result in fewer cyclists (increasing carbon emissions and costs for Torontonians) and will DIRECTLY contribute to cyclist serious injuries and deaths. It\u2019s so disappointing to see this government refuse to see the facts that bike lanes do not increase traffic. Do your job and follow the evidence.\n"

        "comment": "Hi, I am a 24 year old Torontonian and have lived here my entire life. Please, I ask that you consider not removing the bike lanes in Toronto along Bloor, Yonge, and University.\nThis is a waste of resources and will not reduce traffic. It is well established that adding more lanes of traffic only encourages vehicular transportation. It also makes the city unsafe for cyclists and more people will DIE.\nIt\u2019s absurd the province refuses to take care of its people and is making crazy decisions for Toronto without knowing the needs of the city. Inevitably, more people will try to drive and traffic will pile up again.\nPlease do not remove the bike lanes. We should be prioritizing active transportation and transit, not wasting money on this.\n"

        "comment": "As a person who chooses to cycle to work (because it is faster and more affordable than both driving and transit), the improvements to cycling infrastructure in Toronto over the past few years have been instrumental in keeping me safe, reducing congestion, and helping me get to work on time.\nThere is no serious evidence that bike lanes create congestion, and even if there were, major corridors in Toronto need to work and be safe for everyone: bikers, pedestrians, drives, transit users, disabled folks and more.\nThe province should not interfere in municipal affairs like bike lanes. It's an embarrassment, it's pandering for votes, it's bad policy not grounded in reality, and most importantly - it will directly lead to avoidable Ontarian deaths all to win votes from suburbanites who think it'll make their drive 5 minutes faster. Please do not pass this.\n"

        "comment": "I am a resident of Toronto and also a neurologist treating patients with head injuries and other neurological injuries and the number of preventable accidents I see in my practice is astounding. This law is not an against bike lanes, it is a violent attack against public safety. All residents of the city have the right for safe travel corridors and being in a car does not grant you some privilege over others. The research is clear, bike lanes improve the public health of a city by providing safe and active infrastructure for residents . Streets with more pedestrian and cycling infrastructure see an increase in business. This proposal to stop the progress of the city and worse spend my tax dollars to dismantle it is beyond reproach. If this goes forward I hope Doug Ford feels the guilt of the men and women who WILL die as a result of the policies .because we know that people will die, and this is absolutely crazy that he could consider this.\n"

I am both a driver and a biker in downtown Toronto,  and as a driver, slowdowns in traffic are coming from parked cars closing lanes and causing merges, not bike lanes.\nAddress the root problem: it\u2019s not the bike lanes.\nFurther, municipalities should be empowered in how to make decisions on bike lane infrastructure. I don\u2019t understand why the province getting involved - could they focus on solving healthcare problems instead?\n"

        "comment": "DO NOT GET RID OF BIKE LANES. Getting rid of bike lanes does NOT reduce congestion. Getting rid of them makes the road more dangerous for both motorists and cyclists, and increases congestion by making a bike take up space in a motor lane.\nInstead, maybe think of PROTECTING and INCREASING the amount of bike lanes with their own lanes +physical barriers to encourage more cyclists. If I could cycle in a bike lane that physically protected me from motorists, I would bike all the time. Encouraging bike use reduces motorist congestion. Taking away bike lanes doesn\u2019t.\n"
