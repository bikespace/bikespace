People ARE NOT GOING TO STOP BIKING ALONG THESE STREETS even if the bike lanes are removed! Bike lanes ALSO keep drivers safe.\nThe bike lanes are all used for a majority of the year and are extremely popular. In some of these areas, there are more cyclists than drivers. Your \u201cfacts\u201d do not support what is actually happening in the City.\nWe are in a climate crisis and we need to get cars off the road. We are also trying to build a sustainable city - removing bike lanes and requiring more approvals for bike lanes is counter intuitive to climate action and degrading world class city building that we are all trying to achieve.\nI do not support my tax dollars to be used to remove bike lanes (that support sustainable cities, fight climate change, keep people safe, and allow faster mobility throughout Toronto) for no justifiable reason.\nEvery single professional in the transportation, environmental, engineering, etc industry has come out to not support this. There is no science or study to support this. The public does not support this and this is not in the public interest.\nSigned,\nAn Environmental Planner working in Toronto\n"

        "comment": "I live and work in Toronto. My commute is about an hour and a half one way. I'm all for reducing gridlock but attacking bike lanes is like trying to kill a mosquito with a rocket launcher. I look to conservative governments to spend money wisely and this is one of the largest wastes of money I've heard about from this administration. Do you really want to reduce gridlock? Invest in transit! My commute times are the lowest when transit services are running at their optimal efficiency. One little hiccup on the TTC and suddenly people are pouring out onto the street and shuttle busses are fighting with daily commuters to the point that no one can move. We need more trains. More subways. Better reliability. Scrubbing out a little bike lane here and there will do nothing compared to real investment in public transit.\nI'd like to make it clear: I'm AGAINST Bill 212 because it's a waste of money. The money would be better used investing in more public transit to reduce overall gridlock.\n"

        "comment": "The proposal to remove these bike lanes from our city is a shortsighted and dangerous decision that prioritizes convenience for a few over the safety and well-being of many. These bike lanes are not just lines on the road\u2014they are lifelines for thousands of daily cyclists who rely on them to commute safely.\nIn a city where reckless driving and a lack of respect for cyclists already put lives at risk, this move would only exacerbate the problem, leaving more people vulnerable to harm. It is unconscionable to strip away infrastructure that protects vulnerable road users, especially when cities worldwide are investing in sustainable, safe transportation alternatives.\nInstead of removing these critical bike lanes, the province should focus on creating a transportation system that puts civilians\u2019 safety first, fosters inclusivity, and supports eco-friendly commuting. Decisions like these set us back, jeopardizing the progress we've made toward building a safer, more livable city for everyone. I urge the government to reconsider this proposal and listen to the voices of its citizens who demand safer streets, not deadlier ones.\n"

We get notices from the city about a neighbour wanting to cut down a tree or do a small renovation but don\u2019t receive anything close to the level of detail that will cripple the community with gridlock for an indefinite period of time?!!   Unacceptable!  The whole neighborhood was blown away when the only notice we received was that these lanes would be installed in short notice.  After the decision was made by council.\nI have young children and we all ride bikes, but we Never use the Bloor street bike lane.  Who chooses to ride their bike on a stretch of roads filled with lights and busy businesses?\nWhen it comes to driving our kids to school or dance class after school or on a weekend, it has become an absolute nightmare. Riding a bike from Etobicoke to high park is NOT an option with a 6 year old nor is it an option in Winter!\nWould also mention all these \u201cstudies\u201d the pro bike lane folks and Olina Chow references are so skewed!   Only a few minutes lost to traffic?   I invite them to sit on Bloor during a typical rush hour day instead of averaging out traffic over a 24 hour period when the roads are unused.\nFinally would also note - who planned to put it on Bloor on top of a subway line?!  Given how often the Bloor subway line is down, the Shuttle buses bumper to bumper on a single lane completely cripple Bloor street only compounding the issue!\nThank you for some common sense!  Can\u2019t be removed soon enough.\n"

        "comment": "Please do not remove divided bike lanes! These infrastructures keep me safe on a daily basis. Allowing bicycles to have their own lane allows road traffic to focus on motorized vehicle traffic in a streamlined way without worrying about competing with slower bike traffic. I use the bike lane as part of my daily commute and it is always full, many folks rely on this resource and it encourages people to commute in non-polluting manners. Removing lanes makes inner city traffic dangerous for both cyclists and cars\n"

        "comment": "Dear Premier Ford,\nI live in the Bloor West area of Toronto, but I'm from Etobicoke and drive there and back almost daily.\nI only drive and never use a bike, and I am asking you to KEEP THE BIKE LANES in Toronto.\nThe bike lanes on Bloor have made my drive so much smoother and safer. There are no more cars unsafely ducking in and out of lanes to speed along Bloor. There are no more bikes sharing lanes with cars so that it's difficult and dangerous to get around them. And the bike lanes provide a good buffer between the pedestrians on the sidewalks and the car lanes, which is especially important where there are no sidewalks, like at ParkLawn, so that people practically walk on the road. The bike lanes also mean I'm encouraged to allow my kids to bike to school because they will be much much safer.\nIf keeping these bike lanes means people will be safer and doing so will save even just one life, it would be absolutely foolish and abhorrent to take them out. Why put the wrong idea that you're saving a few drivers some time ahead of the lives of others?\nOn top of that, the idea that us drivers will be saving time with more car lane is shown to be not even the case (https://www.cbc.ca/news/science/bike-lanes-impacts-1.7358319). My rush hour drive has actually BEEN FASTER WITH THE BIKE LANES.\nAND I've seen emergency vehicles get through with no problem.\nThen there is the cost of taking the bike lanes out. Why would you waste more tax money than you already have (i.e. the cost of making liquor available at convenience stores, the fines for cancelling green energy projects) taking out a system that's making us safer?\nKeep the bike lanes!\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose the proposed legislation to remove bike lanes on major streets in Toronto, including Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue. This proposal undermines efforts to build sustainable, healthy, and livable cities and contradicts global best practices for managing urban growth and reducing congestion.\n1. Bike Lanes Reduce Congestion, Not Increase It\nStudies consistently show that bike lanes encourage multimodal commuting, reducing the number of cars on the road. When people have safe alternatives like cycling, traffic congestion decreases, benefiting all road users\u2014including drivers. For example:\na) New York City: A study by the NYC Department of Transportation found that bike lanes on 9th Avenue reduced traffic delays by 35% while increasing cycling by 50%.\nb) Copenhagen: Approximately 62% of Copenhageners bike to work daily, reducing car traffic significantly and making it one of the world\u2019s most livable cities.\nc) Toronto\u2019s bike lanes have demonstrated similar success. The Bloor Street bike lane pilot increased cycling volumes by 56% and reduced car travel times by just 2.5 minutes, showing that these lanes benefit more people than they inconvenience.\n2. Health and Environmental Benefits\nEncouraging cycling leads to cleaner air, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and healthier communities. Removing bike lanes increases reliance on cars, worsening air quality and harming public health:\na) Public Health: A study from the University of Glasgow found that regular cycling to work reduces the risk of premature death by 41%.\nb) Environment: Transportation is one of the largest sources of greenhouse gas emissions in Ontario. Expanding car lanes worsens the climate crisis, while cycling infrastructure helps cities meet climate targets.\n3. Livable Cities Are Economically Competitive\nCities with robust cycling infrastructure attract businesses and residents. Safe, accessible bike lanes support thriving local economies by encouraging foot and bike traffic near shops, restaurants, and services. Removing these lanes sends the message that Ontario prioritizes cars over vibrant urban communities.\n4. Misaligned Priorities\nThe argument that removing bike lanes will alleviate congestion is not supported by evidence. Expanding road capacity often leads to induced demand, where more cars use the road, perpetuating congestion. Investments in multimodal transportation, on the other hand, provide long-term solutions to gridlock.\nThe focus should be on expanding and improving cycling infrastructure, not dismantling it. This aligns with global trends and addresses the challenges of urban growth, sustainability, and public health.\nRecommendation\nInstead of removing bike lanes, Ontario should:\n1) Invest in expanding cycling infrastructure to encourage multimodal commuting.\n2) Promote public education on the benefits of cycling.\n3) Use data-driven approaches to demonstrate how bike lanes reduce congestion and support healthier communities.\nLet\u2019s create an Ontario where people have safe, reliable, and sustainable options for getting around. Removing bike lanes is a step backward and would harm Toronto\u2019s reputation as a forward-thinking, livable city. I urge the government to reject this proposal.\n"

        "comment": "I used to be terrified of biking in downtown Toronto. It wasn\u2019t until a friend spent days persuading me to try it\u2014promising we\u2019d stick to bike lanes\u2014that I finally gave in and bought a 24-hour city bike pass. That decision changed my life. Ever since that day, I\u2019ve fallen in love with Toronto in a way I never had before. To date, I\u2019ve taken 1,153 trips using Toronto\u2019s bike-share system, covering 2,705 kilometers.\nWanting to pass on this joy, I\u2019ve convinced many friends to give biking a try\u2014friends who once relied on Uber or their own cars to get around the city. I\u2019ve even taught a friend (to the best of my abilities) to ride a bike for the very first time.\nStill, I often wonder: What if those who drive cars in the city took a leap of faith and tried cycling, just once, like I did? Would they see what I see: a way to move through the city that\u2019s freeing, efficient, and even transformative? And would they then realize how terrifying it is to ride alongside vehicles that could take your life in the blink of an eye?\nFor me and many others, removing bike lanes won\u2019t stop us from cycling. But it will increase the likelihood that I will one day die from being struck by a car.  What will removing bike lanes achieve? At best, a temporary sense of convenience. Encouraging more drivers on the road only creates more congestion, leading to calls for additional road space. This is, in effect, a dog chasing its tail\u2014an endless cycle that squeezes Toronto\u2019s urban core and prioritizes cars at the expense of everything else.\nBiking in Toronto, supported by leadership that actively promotes ridership, benefits everyone\u2014including those who oppose bike lanes even if they don\u2019t know it. It fosters a healthier city, reducing healthcare spending. It creates a greener, more sustainable urban environment. And it positions Toronto as a global leader in urban design and liveability.\nI don\u2019t want to die while riding my bike. Removing bike infrastructure is a step backward, and I believe the passage of Bill 212 would harm our city.\n"
