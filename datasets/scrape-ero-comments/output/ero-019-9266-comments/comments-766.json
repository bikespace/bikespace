I shop on Bloor more now that I can go by bike.  I spend more money than I used to at the shops on Bloor.  I take my car less as a result of having a safe way to ride my bike there.  I am as frustrated as anyone when stuck in traffic but removing the bike lanes will not solve that.  It may ease things very temporarily but will negatively affect the slow build of increased active transportation that we need to really improve congestion in this city. Please do not force the City of Toronto to remove the bike lanes.  They have enhanced my feeling of safety when using my bike and that has resulted in my driving less and riding more.\n"

        "comment": "I have been riding my bike in Toronto for decades, and with the new bike lanes over the past few years, I'm finally feeling safe. And I'm not the only one, the numbers of cyclists has been skyrocketing. Rush hour on the Bloor or College bike lanes is just as busy as it is for cars. Bicycles, however, take up far less room than a car and thus come drivers fail to realize just how much the bike lanes are used. Take a look at the data on bike share for just an inkling of the increasing popularity of cycling (keeping in mind that many cyclists, like myself, prefer to use their own vehicles rather than a rental).\nIn August 2020, my mother -- then in her late 80s -- moved into a residential care facility at Mt. Pleasant and Merton. I almost always cycled there, and had to find a plausible route through some difficult territory -- Avenue Road and Mt. Pleasant clearly prioritize automobiles and the speeding between St. Clair and Bloor on both streets can be excessive.  The arrival of the Yonge St. bike lanes changed everything.  I could visit my mother safely by bike -- freeing the roads of another car and avoiding the underfunded and overcrowded TTC during the pandemic. Yonge St. between St. Clair and Bloor is a community, and should prioritize community use, not automotive speed, especially with Avenue Road and Mt. Pleasant so nearby.\nToronto would be moving backwards if the bike lanes are removed.  This should be avoided at all costs. To truly lessen traffic congestion, construction projects need to be prohibited from shutting down car lanes (often just so workers can park their cars!) and condo projects should not be allowed to take up a lane.\nThe City of Toronto knows best about how to serve its population and I urge the Provincial government to recognize that they should not be in the business of micromanaging Toronto streets.\n"

        "comment": "While the Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act proposes a solution to Ontario's traffic problems, its heavy reliance on expanding road infrastructure and neglect of alternative transportation options are shortsighted and ineffective in the long run. The government\u2019s focus on road construction is likely to exacerbate traffic congestion, contribute to environmental degradation, and encourage urban sprawl. To truly solve Ontario's gridlock issues, the government must prioritize sustainable transportation solutions, such as investing in public transit, improving active transportation infrastructure, and adopting congestion pricing and demand management strategies. Without these measures, the Act risks perpetuating the very problems it intends to resolve.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is a signal of the provincial government trying to overstep regarding bike lane restrictions. This will create extra unnecessary work to get provincial approval from people who do not live in or use the infrastructure in the municipality where changes are planned.\nCongestion is a real problem but the way to solve it is not by adding another lane of vehicles driven by one person, not mentioning induced demand. We need to get people out of vehicles and on to more environmentally friendly and space efficient means of transportation (public transit, cycling, walking). The proposed bill will just make this more challenging and make roads more dangerous for those who do cycle. There will be deaths as a result of bike lane removal, in addition to the massive waste of money for removal of existing lanes in Toronto.\nIn regards to the rest of the bill, the reduction in environmental protections to \u201cspeed up\u201d highway construction is concerning.\n"

        "comment": "I'm grateful that the Premier has created a Bill which will re-open the issue of bike lanes in Toronto.\nI've owned a home in the High Park area for 40 years and hope to retire here soon. I'm a senior with limited mobility and rely on my car to travel in the neighbourhood. This has become more dangerous and unmanageable since the installation of bike lanes on Bloor St West.\nThe lane restrictions have made the traffic move very slowly and the parking situation intolerable. Even with the bike lanes cyclists don't follow the rules of the road which makes things unpredictable and  dangerous.\nI have been unable to enjoy High Park since the park has been closed to cars on the weekends in 2023 as I work during the week. If I have some time off work during the week with the removal of 320 parking spots to accommodate bike lanes I've been unable to use the park. High Park has been a source of enjoyment and a way to balance my mental health over the years and I visited the park at least 2 times a week. It has been a hardship and a disappointment to have my access restricted.\nI would like to see a more equitable solution in place to make the city and the parks more accessible to all residents with our diverse needs.\n"

This will force me on to the road and make me slow down traffic and cause more congestion than otherwise, increasing pollution and putting me at risk of collision and road rage. Furthermore the removal of restrictions on expanding highways will put local ecosystems and species at further risk and cause irreversible harm to the environment. This bill should be cancelled.\n"

        "comment": "Comments on Bill 212 and Proposed Regulations\nBackground\nI am a mother in Toronto with two young children, a cyclist, a lawyer who commutes downtown, and an Adjunct Professor of Public Health Law. I am seriously concerned over my family\u2019s safety due to the Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024 and its proposed regulations. My husband and I ride daily with our children to get to school, daycare, work, errands and shopping and we feel safe doing so because of protected bike lanes on major streets. We ride throughout the year in all weather and by doing so, we reduce the number of cars on the road. We are one of the 55% of households in downtown Toronto who do not own a car.\nThe government\u2019s proposal to infringe on municipal jurisdiction by trying to control their transportation planning is nonsensical and contrary to the evidence. When you add lanes of car traffic, you induce demand. You may see a temporary improvement in the movement of car traffic, but ultimately more cars will begin to use those routes, leaving the traffic worse than it was before. The worldwide data on this is incontrovertible\nWhen I bike on major roads, I am more likely to frequent the businesses on those roads, a fact backed up by the research of local BIAs in Toronto. There are other good reasons to have bike lanes on major roads - just like drivers and transit riders, people on bikes prefer the most direct routes to get where we're going. My office is on University Avenue, so I use that bike lane each day when I bike to work. There are no secondary roads that provide the direct routes and convenience of Bloor, University and Yonge.\nComment on Proposed Regulatory Framework\nIt is difficult to comment on the proposed regulations when the government has provided minimal details about what they propose to include in them. My comments below are based on the scant information that has been provided.\n1) The scope of included municipalities and or roads that will be subject to the bike lanes framework.\nThe intrusion on municipal jurisdiction should affect as few municipalities and roads as possible. This legislation appears to be a transparent attempt to pick on Toronto.\n2) Defined provincial review process for bike lanes that require(d) the removal of an existing lane of traffic.\nThe process should be set out in the regulations to make it as transparent as possible. Guidelines that are internal to the Ministry undermine accountability to the public. The review process should be entirely objective with pre-determined criteria that do not allow for discretionary decision-making or political interference.\nThe review process should be comprehensive and extend beyond considering changes to traffic patterns. It should also consider:\no\tEnvironmental benefits or risks\no\tPublic health impacts in terms of physical activity levels and risk of injury\no\tEquity impacts on low-income and marginalized communities\no\tSafety improvements or risks\no\tEconomic effects on local businesses and communities\no\tPublic expenditures necessary to remove bike lanes and rebuild them elsewhere\no\tChanges to accessibility of streets\no\tClimate change mitigation potential\no\tIntegration with existing transportation networks\nIn terms of timing, no order to remove a bike lane should be made until the construction of an alternative bike lane is underway.\nWritten reasons should be provided that fully justify the decision made in each case.\n3)  Required data, studies, and other information that would be subject to the framework.\nData required should be of a long-term nature. It should include projections of future effects on traffic to account for induced demand effects if a bike lane is removed and replaced with a lane of traffic. Data analysis should account for the fact that people will continue to ride bikes on major roads, they will just do so less safely and in closer proximity to cars. The analysis should also consider potential positive changes to traffic patterns from having more people cycling and fewer people driving if bike lanes are maintained.\nMunicipalities should be allowed to submit international research on the effect of bike lanes on traffic outcomes, safety, and modal share, among other outcomes.\nMunicipalities should provide information on alternative locations for bike lanes, including whether or not there is any alternative route that would connect to existing bike lanes.\nData on the safety of cyclists, pedestrians and drivers should be a primary factor in decision making. Independent peer-reviewed research has shown that the introduction of separated\nbikeways reduces the risk of cycling injury (about 9 times lower risk than a major street\nwith parked cars and no cycling infrastructure).\nThe data provided by municipalities should also:\no\tInclude metrics beyond just traffic flow\no\tConsider seasonal variations in cycling usage\no\tAccount for induced demand in both driving and cycling\no\tMeasure safety improvements and public health outcomes\no\tEvaluate impacts on community wellbeing and urban environmental health\no\tTraffic management measures that could mitigate any congestion on roads where bike lanes are located\nConclusion\nThe regulations should set out a detailed, evidence-based process that considers all impacts of bike lane removal. This may lessen the significant negative impacts of Bill 212 on Ontario\u2019s municipalities and their residents.\n"

        "comment": "This Bill is absolutely ridiculous and is a blatant example of Goverment overreach. It is trying to sidestep municipality's wants and needs and make decisions on their behalf without their input.\nThe Provincial Government should not be able to expropriate your property without explicit permission and compensation for doing so. Basically this Bill would allow the Provincial Government to take the land you paid for and own and dig it up to install infrastructure or pave it over to build a highway, and you would have no say.\nAdditionally, the 413 should not be exempt from environmental impact assessments. It should have to go through the same assessments as everything else. Where the environment is in the forefront of many people's minds, this should not be a corner that we cut.\nFinally, in regards to the \"main talking point\" of this Bill, bike lanes. It does not make any logical sense to remove bike lanes that are already in place. Replacing the bike lane with a lane of traffic will effectively not change a thing. The bikes are not going to go anywhere. If the bike lanes are turned into traffic lanes, that just means the cyclists will being riding in that traffic lane and holding it up. It is also a complete waste of tax payers' dollars to revert infrastructure that was already put in place.\nIf the purpose of this Bill is to \"reduce gridlock\" why is it not looking into alternatives forms of transport that can transport mass amounts of people (i.e. busses and railways)? This Bill does not seem to achieve the purpose of its conception, unless that purpose was endangering cyclists and wasting Ontarion tax dollars.\n"

        "comment": "I object to the provisions for removing bicycle lanes in this legislation.\nCongestion has many causes, including lanes blocked for construction, on-street parking, illegal parking and stopping, vehicles \"blocking the box\" at intersections, and insufficient transit.  Removing bike lanes will not significantly reduce congestion.\nThis legislation ignores issues of safety for cyclists and pedestrians, and people using mobility devices.\nRemoval of bike lanes would also impact the safety of bicycle delivery and courier services.\nMore collisions with bikes will cost us in suffering and increased health care.\nThe local municipal government is closer to the needs and issues of the community.\nIt rightly has responsibility for the design and construction of local roads, to meet these local needs.\nThis legislation is inappropriate micro-management and meddling by the provincial government.  This interference would likely lead to unnecessary time spent and cost at both levels - all paid by the same tax payers.  This is a waste!\n"

In fact, major studies show the opposite: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5c0e5848e5274a0bf3cbe124\u2026\nBike lanes have a greater passenger capacity than lanes for vehicular traffic. The average single lane of private motor-vehicle traffic has a capacity of between 600 and 900 vehicles per hour, representing between 600 and 1,800 people (and it\u2019s closer to the lower end of that range because most cars have but a single occupant).\nBy contrast, the average two-way protected bike lane (which typically occupies less space than a single lane of traffic), has a capacity of 7,500 people per hour.

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes would be detriment to not only the safety of biking commuters in core Toronto, but it will seriously impede community growth. Growing up in a city that prioritizes personal car/vehicle traffic, it noticeably decreases the vibrancy of the community with fewer people walking, biking, or taking public transit to get from A to B.\nIt is also a misconception that more vehicle lanes will decrease traffic. A CBC article published in October of this year references a global study that shows that this is not the case. \u201cThe more traffic lanes that are put in, the more it appeals to people who may not have otherwise have chosen to drive, thereby putting more cars on the roads and increasing congestion\u201d (Mortillaro, 2024).\nI\u2019m very disappointed in this proposal for the above reasons, and also for the fact that this only benefits those who can afford to own a car. If leaders are concerned with improving roadways for everyone, I\u2019d far rather see funds invested in improving public transit - a public service that benefits exponentially more residents.\nProposals like these are embarrassing, for the benefit of the few, and make it clear that our leaders aren\u2019t interested in finding real solutions to real problems. Do better.\n"

        "comment": "This comment is in support of the Ontario government proposing an addendum to the framework that would require the province to remove sections of the Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue bike lanes in the City of Toronto and return them to a lane of traffic for motor vehicles. As a citizen of Etobicoke Kingsway community, my family and I have been directly affected by the city of Toronto imposed bicycle lane on Bloor St. We have experienced increased traffic and increased speeding on our side street as frustrated drivers look for alternatives. We have watched ambulances and fire trucks struggle to attend to emergencies during rush hour as there is no space for cars to pull over. We have listened and sympathized with our small business owners as they see lower revenues from bike lanes impeding their customers and we have experienced longer commute times on weekdays and weekends due to congestion.\nWe believe that the legislation would also, if passed, provide the province with the necessary authority to establish a review process on other existing bike lanes (where the removal of a lane of traffic took place). In reviewing the process during COVID which the city of Toronto and councillor for Ward 6 used to \u201cconsult\u201d, it should be obvious changes are required.
