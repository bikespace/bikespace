        "comment": "We need more viable non-car based transit options, not less. Don't rip up the bike lanes.\nAdding more highways only alleviates traffic for a short time before they are also overrun and congested. What's the point of getting more cars into the city faster when it's already completely overrun and jam packed? It's not worth further ruining our green belt. We need to be prioritizing, and privileging, other forms of transportation like mass public transit.\n"

        "comment": "More Efficient Use of Road Space: Bikes require significantly less space than cars, so bike lanes allow more people to travel on the same road without contributing to traffic jams. Fewer cars on the road often lead to fewer traffic bottlenecks.\nEncouraging Alternative Transportation: By providing dedicated bike lanes, cities encourage more people to choose cycling over driving, particularly for short trips. This shift reduces the overall number of cars on the road, which eases congestion.\nImproved Flow for Public Transport: Fewer cars on the road help public transportation systems like buses move more freely, as they face less interference from traffic jams. Dedicated bike lanes contribute to this by providing a separate space for cyclists.\nReduced Need for Parking: As more people opt for bikes, the demand for parking spaces decreases, leading to fewer instances of cars circling city blocks searching for parking, which is a common cause of gridlock.\nEnhances Cyclist Safety: Dedicated bike lanes create a safer environment for cyclists by separating them from car traffic, reducing accidents and encouraging more people to bike. When cycling feels safer, more people choose it over driving, which further reduces the number of cars and contributes to easing traffic.\nSmoother Intersections: Bike lanes often come with improved traffic signal systems and dedicated turn lanes, which streamline movement through intersections. This organization reduces the likelihood of backups and delays at key points in traffic flow.\nLowered Emissions and Idling Times: When traffic flows more freely and gridlock is minimized, there\u2019s less idling and fewer emissions. Bike lanes contribute by helping reduce the number of cars on the road, indirectly improving overall traffic conditions.\nBoosts Local Business Traffic: Bike lanes increase accessibility for cyclists, who are more likely to stop at local shops, cafes, and restaurants along their routes compared to drivers. This can lead to higher foot traffic and sales for nearby businesses, supporting the local economy and reducing the need for larger parking spaces.\nIncreases Employment in the Delivery Sector: As bike lanes make cycling safer and more accessible, there\u2019s a rise in bicycle-based delivery services for food and packages. This growth creates job opportunities in the delivery sector, with businesses often choosing bike couriers to navigate dense urban areas more efficiently than cars or trucks can.\nProven to Ease Gridlock in Cities: Numerous studies have shown that cities implementing bike lanes experience reduced congestion. For example, cities like New York, Copenhagen, and Amsterdam have successfully reduced gridlock by creating extensive bike lane networks, proving that dedicated bike infrastructure can be a powerful tool in improving overall traffic flow.\n"

        "comment": "The proposal to assess existing bike lines is non-objectionable, assuming that a fair assessment is used.  It takes time from the creation of bike lanes until they become fully utilized, so an appropriate time horizon should be used, say starting at least one year and better two years after completion of the bike lane.\nHowever the premier's public comments that he plans to remove bike lanes on Bloor St. and other streets in Toronto suggest that he has already decided what he wants to do and this assessment is planned to be only symbolic, and that the assessors will be pressured to confirm to the premier's biases, and/or the results of the study will be ignored.  This is not acceptable.   The premier is not the mayor of Toronto and imposing his private will on the city is an overreach and abuse of his powers and profoundly anti-democratic.\nIt is true that there has been significant congestion on Bloor Street related recently, in part coinciding with the introduction of bike lanes.  However, a large amount of this congestion is related to various construction projects which are happening throughout Toronto, including the bike lane construction (a one time impact), but also subway reconstruction, condo construction, Metrolinx projects, water main replacement, etc.  Any assessment of a bike lane's impacts on traffic should not be done if there is any on-going construction in the study area, as it becomes impossible to determine what is causing the impacts.  Similarly, studies should be done at times when the TTC is operating normally.  As a frequent driver on Bloor street I can clearly state that congestion is highly correlated to construction activity.\nAs shown in many studies, bike lanes typically reduce traffic congestion in the long run, as more traffic moves to bikes, which take up much less space than cars.  The Bloor bike lanes are heavily used and remove significant traffic from the roads.  An example of a study that  discusses this is below:\nhttps://www.cbc.ca/news/science/bike-lanes-impacts-1.7358319\nAlso, the users of the bike lanes are typically the residents of the affected area or nearby, and benefit the most from the bike lanes, in terms of safety, speed, and convenience.  The car drivers are typically coming from farther away, so are visitors to the area.   Preference should be given the actual residents of an area.\nFinally, as described below, bike lanes are good for local businesses, as there is more traffic by people who can stop frequently to shop at local stores.  Car drivers are more likely to shop at big box chain stores with large parking areas, which once again occupy valuable real estate.   So bike lanes support vibrant main commercial streets, while streets with many lanes of car traffic tend to kill local businesses.\nhttps://toronto.citynews.ca/video/2024/10/24/annex-businesses-tell-ford\u2026\nTo summarize, this assessment feels like it will be rigged to justify the premier's bias, not a true study on the merits of a highly valuable initiative by the city.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is clearly aimed to blame the congestion and the ongoing traffic challenges within Toronto on cyclists and bike lanes. The Ontario government is looking for easy, populist \"solutions\" to ease traffic within the city while clearly ignoring the available, scientific evidence. The assumption that traffic issues like congestion could be eased by removing bike lanes is categorically false, as has been proven time and time again by a vast body of scientific research from around the globe.\nIt is indeed in the interest of the Ontario government to support the expansion of bike lanes to motivate people to use cycling or similar methods of transport as a safe, viable and fast alternative to driving a car. Cyclists and bike lanes don't cause congestion, cars do. To simplify this decision for the people in power I am adding a few links for you to check out that are based on scientific research and not the frequently mentioned \"common sense\".\nSource1: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5c0e5848e5274a0bf3cbe124\u2026\nSource 2: https://epub.wupperinst.org/frontdoor/deliver/index/docId/6597/file/659\u2026\nSource 3: https://www.tcat.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Bloor-Economic-Impact-St\u2026\nI would highly recommend for the provincial government to strike down this bill and leave the responsibility to the city governments, which actually seem to have a science-based understanding on what is needed to ease congestion. Bike lanes enables safe passage for tends of thousands of Torontonians and abusing this bill as a way to gain votes is tasteless, disrespectful and dangerous. Thank you for considering my comment.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal makes me so angry. It's short-sighted, bad for traffic, bad for cities, bad for the environment. How DARE Doug Ford try to take power out of municipalities' hands like this thinking the province knows what is best and trying to give his own government power that should be left to the neighborhoods and cities that are best equipped to make this decision.\nAs a driver, bike lanes keep people out of cars. I am sick of being surrounded by gridlock in Toronto where every vehicle has ONE person sitting and taking up space. As a cyclist and a driver I want there to be dedicated space for bikes so cars and bikes do not have to be in conflict to get to the same places. Everywhere a car wants to go in a city a bike wants to go too. Removing bike lanes only makes it likelier that a car and bike will be in a collision because there is no safe place for a bike to be. That's bad for everyone.\nWhy would we allow cars to park on major thoroughfares? Those corridors are best suited to moving traffic, people, along via transit, bike, or car. Letting cars stop and take up space is so much worse for gridlock than allowing moving vehicles like bikes and transit to move THROUGH.\nEvery bike trip is a win for traffic because it's one less car trip making more space for everyone.\nCars are the least efficient way to move groups of people. Cities should be able to prioritize bikes and transit. And they should be able to do it at the expense of cars. In a dense city like Toronto gridlock will never be better by allowing more concessions and ease to cars. Other forms of moving people are all so much better suited to the task.\nThe fact that Ford's government thinks they have the right to overreach power to make awful decisions such as this is atrocious. His hubris is sickening, conservatives love the idea of removing government and small government until something they don't agree with is popular and they're more than willing to add unnecessary cost and beaurocracy to block whatever it is. This is a waste of money, a gross power trip, a tragedy for the environment and people of the cities who have been begging for bike lanes for decades. I am absolutely livid at Ford for this one.\n"

I am extremely concerned about this bill as I feel that it is a huge overstep by the province into municipal matters, especially when there are so many more priorities the province should be focusing on such as the state of housing, education, and healthcare.\nThe bike lanes are a huge improvement to streets for everyone involved, and there is a lot of development slated for Etobicoke on the future. Eliminating bike lanes will set us back, and will compromise the safety of everyone on the road; and furthermore, will not even solve the problem that is traffic as, without many options in Etobicoke specifically, everyone will just turn to driving, further clogging up the road. There have been half a dozen deaths of cyclists in Toronto so far, and perhaps instead of attacking cyclists further, we further enforce rules against careless driving in Ontario \u2014 after all, don't the police have a huge budget for this very reason, to keep us all safe? We all have an equal right to the road, and I refuse to support a bill that prioritizes one vocal group above the other. On top of saving lives, it also improves access to small businesses\u2014just ask the Bloor Annex BIA.\nPlease listen to reason and data. Bike lanes are good, and should stay. Your government should focus on staying in your lane and solving real issues that matter to Ontarians.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 is simply not going to improve traffic flow. Especially not in the downtown core of the City of Toronto. The beliefs that support it are also inaccurate and do not reflect the reality of urban traffic flow. I have outlined my reasoning with evidence to support it below. Bill 212 will be an expensive mistake that will likely make traffic WORSE and endanger more lives.\nFirst, many of the lanes proposed to be taken out that \"remove an existing lane of traffic\" did not remove a functionally usable traffic lane, as these lanes were being used for street-side parking.\nStreet-side parking is shown by the Transportation Research Institute to substantially increase traffic congestion. Bike lanes, instead improve traffic flow by reducing the total number of vehicles on the road, and in many cases, don't even reduce the amount of street side parking spaces.\nSecond, the addition of this lane for car traffic would not improve congestion. Fundamental studies show that providing more lanes and roads does not improve traffic flow as it creates an increase in the amount of drivers.\nBoth of these studies have been provided as links.\nThis shows that the addition of a single urban driving lane by removing bike lanes will not improve congestion, and the 413 will likely not improve congestion either.\nFurther case studies linked also show that the removal of Urban Highways improves the quality of life for citizens, as evidenced in Seoul - a city with a population over triple that of Toronto - successfully removed an urban highway and saw:\n - Improved travel times in the city\n - Revitalized local business\n - Reductions in city overheating\n - Recovery of the local ecosystem\nCreating more roads for traffic will increase the amount of drivers. Not only will this not improve traffic conditions, it will likely worsen traffic and result in more traffic related death as vehicles trend larger year over year.\nEvidence reported by the CBC that is also linked here show that vehicles are getting larger every year, with smaller cars being phased out of production. Every year, as a result, the same amount of drivers take up more space on the road than previously. Traffic would be getting worse as a result, even if bike lanes had not been built. Replacing them with more drivers will only make the problem worse.\nThe IIHS-HLDI research linked also shows that the increase in vehicle size is creating a greater risk to pedestrians. Increasing vehicle sizes and front-end heights results in more collisions that are more likely to result in death for both drivers and non-drivers. These vehicles also create greater emissions leading Ontario to fall behind its goals in addressing fossil fuel consumption and climate change.\nUnless the province is willing to regulate and reduce vehicle size, it will need to reduce the total amount of vehicles on the road for the safety and well-being of its people. Bill 212 will endanger more lives and create more pollution.\nBill 212 will result in more drivers on the road during a crucial point in time where the number of vehicles must be reduced. The City of Toronto's municipal government is more equipped to understand the needs of its people than the Provincial Government who would do well to not spend public money on making traffic worse.\n"

It is much more stressful to drive with a bike in the same lane as me.\n"

        "comment": "I think 100% of Ontario residents are in favour of reducing gridlock and reducing time in transit... but I think it is really important that we look for forward thinking ways to achieve this based on data and best practices from other cities around the world that have had success. I drive and I cycle in the cycle. I know that many people do not have that luxury and have to drive from a distance away but the solution to their gridlock to not necessarily getting rid of bike lanes or building more highways.\nI have always liked thinking about it as - how do we move the most people versus how do we move the most cars. If we have clean and safe transit options that people want to use this along would be the best way to draw people off the highways and make room for those that NEED to use the highway versus those who choose to use the highway.\nThe same with bike lanes - if these are designed well and are safe, this also makes people choose cycling over driving for short commutes, so that more room is on the roads for the drivers who have no other viable choice.\nSo if the data shows that you can improve overall efficiency and move more people by removing bike lanes on certain roads, I guess I would accept that, but the real key to unlocking gridlock in the city is not these splashy tactics that get peoples attention - it is building WAY for public transit that is clean, efficient and modern. This will do so much more to alleviate gridlock than adding a lane of traffic on an urban street.\n"

Where will all those cars park? How will we achieve our climate change goals if we increase the land that we pave over while increase the amount of car trip? Instead we should focus on increasing the frequency of the GO train including weekends so people can have an adequate alternative. A carpooling lane that goes all the way to Toronto could easily be implemented leading to more carpooling and hence less individual cars on the 401. We need more protected seperate bike lanes that connects businesses highly populated residential areas so that more people choose to cycle/use a scooter instead of their cars to get to work and run errands. The new proposed highway would destroy thousands of hectars of wetlands/forests which are essential to absorb water with flooding  (otherwise we will spend many more millions to fix the excess damage caused by the floods being worse). It would also pave over and destroy permanently precious farmland. That will not help with the cost of groceries. I am thankful that I live in waterloo and I am able to almost cycle to work in protected separated bike lanes to work everyday (although the city could still use more connections to many other points of interest)\n"

So this whole curfuffle come from people being angry that the down town traffic is bad who are driving in from another city and don't even pay that larger city's taxes! There are many things to do but adding another lane and taking another lane away from cyclists is not the answer.\nAlso!!! People with wheel chairs and motorized scooters use the bike lane to get around not just the bikes so let's thing of more people than just cyclists please.\nNot to mention people who can not afford a car are now being punished because they can't afford one but they can afford a bike.\nSo it's just a war on the poor and the old so that's fun of you.
