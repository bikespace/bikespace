        "comment": "This comment is in opposition to the framework that would enable provincial approval for new bike lanes on municipal roads and to provincial involvement in the removal of the bike lanes on Bloor St., Yonge St., and University Ave.\nThe crux of this opposition is housed in the premise that a higher order of government cannot carry out the depth of analysis needed to establish what is best for traffic control\u00a0within municipalities. Municipalities\u00a0are not one size fits all and need flexibility to determine what is best for their residents instead of additional bureaucracy\u00a0in the form of approvals from further levels of government.\nAs a resident of Toronto who walks, drives, takes, transit, and cycles I appreciate that wherever\u00a0a bike lane is installed it is studied extensively and impact to motor vehicle travel times is always part of that consideration, before and after any installation. This data from the City should be reviewed before any removals are considered. The last time I attended to them I would say that on average the increase to motor vehicle travel times increased by 10 minutes on average. An increase of this degree is minimal and could never justify the risk to safety that will be incurred by all road users by their removal. I strongly echo the position of the 120 physicians and researchers signatories in the supporting link that \"Legislation proposing to guide road design decisions, such as Bill 212, should explicitly place a higher priority on road safety than motor vehicle travel times.\" The costs that have already been incurred in the installation of these well-studied lanes and what would be incurred in their proposed removal also represent a wasteful expense.\nGridlock is an important concern but it is extremely questionable that it is caused by bike lanes. Municipalities would be best positioned to assess this but in my own experience (travelling regularly between Hamilton and Pickering) it is rampant across the GTHA whether there are bike lanes present or not. It is most certainly present on roads where bikes are explicitly\u00a0forbidden.\nIt is important to flag that the three streets flagged for removal in Toronto (Bloor St., Yonge St., and University Ave) are all on subway lines. A far more impactful way to reduce gridlock on these roads would be to more adequately fund the transit that runs under them. As someone who has used these lines for decades I can note that the rider experience in them is worse than ever. At present there are\u00a015 Reduced Speed Zones due to insufficient\u00a0track repair and there are continuous delays due to safety alarms. In order to reduce gridlock there must be a focus on viable alternatives.\n"

        "comment": "Building highway 413 will not solve the traffic problem in the GTA. All it will do is induce demand on the new highway causing more traffic.\nIf you must build the wasteful highway then there are processes to follow. The environmental assessment is an important way to ensure the damage to our precious natural resources is mitigated as much as possible. The air, ground, and water all along the highway will be affected by the new scar across the landscape and its construction. The people of Ontario deserve to know how it will affect our resources. The only reason one might want to forgo the environmental impact assessment is because there is something important to our ecosystem in the way.\n     There are processes and precedent in how and when the Provence can expropriate land from its citizens. Anything other than that is theft. Not only is it against the conventions of the Provence, but it is just plain immoral.\n     The section about removing bike lanes in just the premiers attempt to obfuscate the pillaging of peoples property, the destruction of our natural environment, and to pander to his base. Bike lanes do not contribute to the excessive traffic in the GTA or any other city in the world let alone Ontario. It is healthy, which reduces the strain on the healthcare system, it is safe, especially when investments are made to separate the vehicles from the bikes. Having a properly separated bike lane is much more efficient way to move people allowing more people to take other modes of transportation that ACTUALLY REDUCE TRAFIC CONGESTION. The better the bike infrastructure the more people will use it. This creates a feedback loop that decreases congestion and reduces collisions.\n     The removal of bike lanes is just a front in the culture war the premier flounders against instead of actually making moves that will help the people of Ontario. And Bill 212 will not help, only hinder.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong concerns about the bike lanes recently implemented on Bloor Street near my residence. While I understand the intention to promote cycling, the reality has been far from beneficial. The removal of a traffic lane has caused significant traffic congestion, and it now takes me an extra 20 minutes to get to my parents' house, just a few blocks away, due to the increased traffic jams. This has not only caused frustration for local drivers but has also negatively impacted the overall flow of traffic in the neighbourhood.\nAdditionally, bike lanes in Toronto do not make sense for the majority of the year. During the winter months, when the weather is harsh, no one is using these bike lanes. This results in an under-utilized infrastructure that remains empty for much of the year while continuing to disrupt the flow of traffic and the general livability of the area.\nThe increased congestion is ruining the neighbourhood and making everyday commuting increasingly difficult. I fully support cycling initiatives, but the current approach is harming the community more than it is helping. I urge you to reconsider this initiative and explore alternative solutions that can accommodate both cyclists and drivers, ensuring the efficient use of public roads year-round.\nThank you for considering my feedback.\n"

Please do not proceed with this plan to remove bike lanes. People will continue to bike, but it will simply be more dangerous.

It is our right to be safe and separated from vehicles. My children use these bike lanes and when are separate from vehicles are more safe.\nThe cost to tax payers to remove the existing bike plans is a waste of tax payers money.

        "comment": "Bill 212, particularly its assault on bike lanes, represents a disgraceful step backward for Ontario. By giving the provincial government the power to review and remove municipal bike lanes, this bill undermines local decision-making and threatens the safety and sustainability of our cities.\nBike lanes on major streets like Bloor, Yonge, and University are not mere conveniences; they are essential infrastructure that supports active transportation, reduces traffic congestion, and lowers emissions. Removing them to cater to car traffic is not only regressive but outright dangerous, forcing cyclists to share roads with vehicles and putting lives at risk.\nThe $48 million estimated cost of removing these lanes is a gross misuse of taxpayer dollars. Instead of investing in safer streets and more sustainable transportation options, this bill proposes to destroy infrastructure that works and is widely used. It prioritizes car dependency over people-friendly urban design, sending a clear message that this government values vehicles over vibrant, healthy communities.\nThis isn\u2019t about reducing gridlock\u2014it\u2019s about rolling back progress. Cities around the world are expanding bike networks because they know the future of transportation is multimodal, not car-dominated. Ontario should be leading this charge, not tearing it down.\nBill 212 is a direct attack on the progress Toronto and other municipalities have made to create safer, greener streets. The provincial government must respect local autonomy and recognize that bike lanes are a vital part of modern cities, not obstacles to be removed. We cannot afford this kind of backward thinking. Ontario deserves better.\n"

        "comment": "Biking as mode of transportation has multiple benefits: It's green, it boosts mental and physical health and it has a small footprint compared to motor vehicles. There are numerous examples in Europe how good bike infrastructure makes cities more vibrant and livable. Banning and tearing up bike lanes would set Toronto back in time and make it a worse place to live for its residents.\nIn stark contrast to the Premiers divisive comments, bikes and bike lanes are not an impediment to motor traffic. On the contrary, a good bike infrastructure helps alleviate congestion on city streets.\nBiking is an important and convenient way for me to get around in the city. Without safe bike lanes it would become too risky and I would probably not ride. Passing Bill 212 would certainly mean that more cyclists would lose their lives in traffic and the Premier and his party would have blood on their hands.\n"

        "comment": "The framework of Bill 212 concerning bike lanes is not supported by organizations that a provincial government should be listening to. The Ontario Professional Planners Institute has this to say: \"The proposed legislative changes will not reduce congestion, will increase risk to public safety, and move away from evidence-based practices.\"\nMore broadly with respect to the bill, there are obvious inconsistencies with how some changes are to be implemented as compared to others. For example, the bill would exempt construction of a new highway from the Environmental Assessment Act, while at the same time requiring Ministry review for both new and existing bike lanes.\nAs impacts Toronto\u2014Canada\u2019s largest city and one aspiring to be world class\u2014the framework is a step backwards on many fronts. Other much larger cities such as London, England are doing the opposite, promoting more commuting by bicycle. This policy is supported by congestion charges that provide disincentives for bringing cars into the core of the city and a fully developed system of public transit.\nYes, reducing congestion is a laudable goal, but there isn\u2019t clear evidence this will be the result of the legislation in the short run. And as for medium- and long-term considerations, much of the rest of the western world is of the view that promoting other forms of transportation rather than automobiles gets people to work as quickly and is important for many other reasons, not the least of which is the undeniable drastic impact of CO2 from internal combustion engines, which will be a large part of the collective automobile fleet for some time. Also, promoting personal fitness and making for livable urban centres are other goals served by bike lanes.\nThen there are the safety considerations with Bill 212. As a senior in his late 60s living in mid-town Toronto, I have recently begun to cycle much more to various points in the city, largely in part because of dedicated bicycle lanes. For many years I would not cycle except on local streets, having in my 20s collided with suddenly opened car doors, and flying over the hoods of cars making right turns without checking for bicycles beside them.  I also cycle more because of changes in TTC policies allowing bicycles on subways; I now consider leaving the car in the driveway if I can use a combination of transit and cycle. Our provincial government should be looking for ways to further integrate cycling and public transit to reduce road congestion.\nAlarmingly, Bill 212 is silent about the safety of cyclists in the evaluation of any bike lane. So far, the only criteria is \u201cthe orderly movement of motor vehicle traffic.\u201d\nI graduated as a civil engineer in the mid \u201880s, and was dismayed during my formal studies that exercises in my program sometimes compared the higher costs of public liability insurance where safety measures such as elevated rail crossings were decided against. Avoiding the human toll of injury and death were not considerations by themselves. Surely in 40 years, safety of citizens should now be given higher priority in legislation such as Bill 212. Even the Ontario Traffic Council says so: \u201cWhile the efficient flow of traffic is an important element of transportation planning and engineering, it should not come at the expense of cyclists\u2019 and other vulnerable road users\u2019 lives.\u201d\nBill 212\u2019s provisions with respect to bicycle lanes are not based on evidence. It will not achieve its stated objectives, and will put lives at risk. It should not be passed as it is currently written.\n"

Removing them will not only endanger our lives but also the lives of our family, friends and people who use these lanes daily for work and other activities.   The lanes are often very busy - do you have any idea how many people use these lanes for daily travel?  When you think of all these people in cars, we know the roads will be even more congested!  Research has proven that removing bike lanes and widening roads increases congestion.\nWe need to drastically reduce our carbon emissions.    Encouraging biking and making it safe will take cars off the roads, thus reducing our carbon emissions.   It is a waste of tax payer money to remove bike lanes.  Businesses will suffer from reduced traffic.   Biking is an inexpensive way to travel - we should be encouraging this not stopping it.  We need more options to help us get around, not fewer.\nFurthermore and with emphasis, the provincial government has no business meddling in municipal decisions - these ae always best left to the local level.

This sloppiness allows for far too much overreach from the Province in every Schedule item. I\u2019m strongly opposed to Bill 212.\nI made an entire video breaking down my thoughts, and that can be found in the attached link (or here: https://youtu.be/8-1vT0TmQjs). The video is making the rounds online and for good reason: the schedules that go over Highway 413 (the majority of the 22 pages of the Bill 413) have not been in the news and instead, the bike lanes have been all that have been talked about.\nDoug Ford specifically stated in the past that he would not be touching the Greenbelt but here he is, bypassing environmental assessments and implementing land grabs.\nAs for everything to do with the Provincial overreach of matters to do with bike lanes and removing the ability to sue the Province for issues that the Province creates (endangering road users who are outside of vehicles), that\u2019s not service the citizens of Ontario. It\u2019s taking rights away.\nBill 212 won\u2019t reduce gridlock because more lanes simply don\u2019t reduce traffic, they just cause MORE people to drive, which then creates more congestion. The fact that the Minister of Transportation doesn\u2019t grasp this makes him unfit for the position.\nOntarians NEED more options to get around, other than being forced to drive personal automobiles which are only getting more and more expensive.\nThe Province of Ontario needs to be using the money that they\u2019ve earmarked for Highway Expansions for Healthcare and Education because the money is clearly there.\nAs for housing affordability, the Missing Middle needs to be the majority of units that we are building \u2013 not Single Family Dwellings.\n"

It interferes with municipalities who are committed to growing accessible, active transportation that is climate friendly and affordable. The removal existing bike lines along sections of Bloor, Yonge, and University in Toronto (and potentially in other municipalities as per the proposed process) is an gross misuse of taxpayer dollars. It will not reduce gridlock. It creates more gaps in cycling infrastructure and will force cyclists to ride in the street. This increases the risk of collision and injury requiring police and ambulance- overburdening emergency response systems. Not to mention additional demand to our struggling health care system to treat serious injuries that could have been avoided. This proposal does not make streets safer, it makes them more dangerous for cyclists and motorists. Accidents, the opposite of reducing gridlock, will happen. If the Government of Ontario truly \"recognizes that accidents and lane closures can worsen traffic congestion and impact the quality of life of Ontarians,\" then invest in safe cycling infrastructure that gives people an alternative to travelling by vehicle. At the very minimum, do not make current cycling infrastructure worse; leave the bike lanes alone. I cannot stress enough that the \"return\" of bike lanes to traffic is fiscally irresponsible.\n"
