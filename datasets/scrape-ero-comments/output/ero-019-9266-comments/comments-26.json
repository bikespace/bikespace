This is the very definition of red tape. Municipalities have the most context on what their citizens need at the local level and requiring approval from the provincial government to make positive changes in their communities is inefficient and ineffective. There must be better things that the Ministry of Transportation can use their time and resources on. Please focus on things that improve the lives of Ontario residents that only the Ontario government can do. Build more regional public transit please\n"

Taking away bike lanes will mean more people driving instead of taking active transportation, and more cars on the road means more traffic and more gridlock. I choose to bike where there are dedicated bike lanes or multi use paths because I feel safe and separate from cars on that infrastructure. This means I\u2019m one less car on the road causing traffic for other drivers. If the Ford government truly cared about reducing gridlock, they would invest in ways to travels that are alternatives to cars, like bike lanes, trains, buses etc..\n"

        "comment": "Hello!\nWe support bike lines.\nWe know from evidence that bike lanes help to:\n- reduce gridlock\n- reduce greenhouse gases\n- get people moving faster\n- provide safety\nBike lanes are not just a matter of convenience; they are vital for many residents who rely on affordable transportation options. Delivery drivers, including those in food and courier services, as well as individuals who simply cannot afford vehicles due to the high cost of living, depend on both public transportation and bike lanes to move around the city.\nBikes are also an almost completely green way to travel due to little road wear/ break dust, comparatively less resource intensive manufacturing and no tail pipe emissions, something that is extremely important considering the climate crisis. Encouraging the use of bikes by providing safe and efficient bike lanes will not only improve air quality in the short term it will help save our planet\nWe must also recognize that traffic congestion is self-perpetuating. More cars on the road lead to more traffic. It\u2019s a cycle that anyone who takes a moment to reflect on the situation would easily understand. Expanding bike lanes offers an opportunity to break this cycle by encouraging more people to use alternative modes of transport, thereby reducing overall congestion and improving the flow of traffic for everyone.\nInvesting in safe, accessible bike infrastructure is essential for the health, safety, and well-being of our communities, as well as for addressing the city\u2019s pressing environmental and transportation challenges. These actions are not only distractions from the real needs of our city but also betray a lack of vision and leadership when it comes to addressing urban challenges. Bike lanes are a practical, immediate step that can provide tangible benefits for Toronto residents, but we need all levels of government working together, in good faith, to make them a reality.\nWe need a government that supports making decisions that are based in evidence.\nI feel quite embarrassed and sad for the policy designers who have to write bad policy, based on emotion, hatred and jealousy - all in order to distract the voters from the real problems (i.e. the province inability to actually get people moving by investing in regional transportation solutions, and not being able to actually get a project completed in time or on budget).\n"

        "comment": "This legislation has no basis in peer reviewed studies of the issue and should not be passed. Not only is it an overreach in Provincial power, but it is also reactionary and based on zero evidence. Worldwide studies have shown that bike lanes help ease traffic congestion. Removing bike lanes will be costly and only increase gridlock due to added construction. Not only are bike lanes being used as a political tool to gain support for the current government but they are using them to spread misinformation and distract from the fact that the current government has no plan to decrease traffic congestion and would rather try to distract the public while worsening the situation. The Ford government simply does not have the publics best interest.\n"

        "comment": "Regarding Highways:\nInduced demand has historically negated any benefits from highway expansions within 13-18 months in Ontario. The funds would be better spent on well-designed transit projects, preferably elevated and high-speed transit. Elevated transit, ideally consisting of inverted trains, would allow the area above the track to be used for wind and solar energy capture. This design also better protects the concrete from the elements, reducing issues like those seen with the Gardiner Expressway.\nMoreover, elevated trains can double up on roads without affecting traffic. High-speed rail can more easily navigate the lack of acceptable corridors for true 250 km/h+ rail. Both high-speed and local elevated transit should offer local, local express, and express modes with well-coordinated timetables to encourage people to leave their cars and enjoy their commute by reading a book or relaxing.\nRegarding Bike Lanes:\nProperly designed bike lanes are not just a transit concern; they are public safety infrastructure. For example, the bike lanes on Adelaide and Richmond in Toronto provide transport for an additional 400 people per rush hour, compared to only about 80 for an additional car lane due to exit ramps. Additionally, ambulances and other emergency services use the current infrastructure to bypass cars that cannot move out of the way during emergencies. Lives will be lost if these lanes are removed. Rescue equipment will be blocked, and fire engines will be unnecessarily deployed and stuck when a faster supervisor vehicle could access the site if an engine is not needed.\nMunicipalities should build infrastructure for their own citizens and know best where to place it without provincial bureaucratic overhead. Providing funds for public safety and transit infrastructure will allow people to travel without the stress and hardships of driving, improving the quality of life for everyone. Those who still drive will benefit from reduced traffic if the money is invested in public safety and transit infrastructure.\nOverall Impact of the Bill:\nThis bill, in its current form, only guarantees more gridlock, reduces mobility, and will create enclaves where people are locked into their neighbourhoods.\n"

        "comment": "The implementation of bike lanes on major arteries in Toronto was poorly thought through and was, in part, predicated on the assumption that, magically, 75% of trips within 5km would be on foot, public transit or bicycle. This was a fantasy from the very beginning and the reality has been, instead, increased congestion and minimal adoption of the bike lanes. This is quite apart from the easily foreseeable, but completely ignored, consequences on traffic volumes on side streets and delays to busses and emergency vehicles.\nThe province should not need to wait for reports from the City about these effects. They are easily observable on a daily basis (the volume of bicyclists compared to other forms of transit are laughably small, even in good weather). In addition, the City has already published one report on the Bloor Street West Complete Street Extension (entitled \"Data Update on Interim Conditions (June 2024)\") which clearly demonstrates (on page 6 of the report) that, even on the three days in April and May that they chose to measure bicycle volumes, the percentages of bicycles compared to \"vehicles\" was in the very low single digits. When challenged about what it would take for the City to change their plans, at a Community meeting this summer, a City employee could only reply that \"it takes time for people to change their behaviour\". Need I say more! No more waiting for further studies please\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to you today as an Etobicoke Lakeshore resident and a father who is also a car driver, cyclist and pedestrian and has major concerns about the discussion of prohibiting bike lanes if they remove a lane of traffic. I appreciate that congestion is a major concern of this government and there is a desire to use every tool in the toolbox to address it. However, a forced review of all bike lanes on roadways by the Ministry of Transportation is not the correct policy as we risk throwing the baby out with the bathwater. First, numerous studies have shown that lane reductions due to protected cycling infrastructure do not increase congestion over time and any temporary decrease in vehicular travel time from removing lanes is eventually eliminated due to induced demand on these roadways. This is especially true in Etobicoke Lakeshore where we will see over 10,000 new residents in the next 5 to 10 years along the Bloor corridor which will increase congestion unless we find safe alternatives to driving.\nFurthermore, as we see in the case of Parkside drive in West Toronto where the local community has worked closely with the City of Toronto to address excessive speeding on this roadway which includes a by-directional protected bike lane in one lane in order to help reduce the speed on this road and prevent accidents. A policy such as this will only add red-tape to a project that has been studied in great detail by the city and potentially cost lives of all road users through any such delay.\nI contrast this with Burnhamthorpe in Etobicoke Lakeshore between Dundas and Kipling where there have been multiple accidents including the death of a cyclist this year. This is all despite the local communities best efforts to reduce speed in this roadway. We can almost guarantee that a bike lane on this road would have saved this cyclist's life and would help accomplish a true reduction in speed that only a roadway adjustment would allow.\nLastly, the issue I wish to speak to is the very lives of Ontario citizens which will be put at risk from this policy. Toronto has already seen six cyclist lives lost so far this year and the majority of these lives were lost on streets without bike lanes (the most deaths in the 20+ years since Toronto has been tracking this data). Going forward with this policy will increase the safety risk for cyclists and will lead to an increase in injury and death. This risk will directly affect myself and my daughter as I use my bike to take her to local events and after school classes. I don't know if you have biked with a child in mixed traffic without bike lanes, but I can say that protected bike lanes are the only thing that makes this form of transportation viable for a family.\nUltimately, I hope the government does not go forward with this policy due to its negligible benefits and increased long term health and safety risks for citizens.\n"

Making it more difficult to provide those alternatives will only make traffic worse, as everyone that was on a bike will be more likely to drive a car. This isn't even mentioning all of the other bad things that excessive driving causes, such as air and noise pollution, aggravating climate change, making life more unaffordable by requiring more people to drive and driving up demand for cars and gas, amongst other things. Also, why are you all trying to make it more difficult to build anything? We don't need more gatekeeping, we need more building.\n"
