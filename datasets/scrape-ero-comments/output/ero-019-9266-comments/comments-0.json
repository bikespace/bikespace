        "comment": "Being in a car does not make a person's time commuting more valuable than anyone on a bike, on foot, or on transit.\nThis proposed legislation is designed to turn Ontarians against each other and blame cyclists for their own choices to get in a car instead of on this government's lack of progress on funding transit, or employers forcing return to office mandates.\nI was hit by a car while riding in Toronto in 2016 severely injuring my shoulder. I spent 6 weeks in a sling, months doing physio and my bike was destroyed. My wife had to help me dress, shower and cook for weeks while I underwent physio.\nMy long-term mental health and physical health was deeply harmed by this experience. It took me 2 years to get the confidence to ride again and when I got back on two wheels I stuck almost exclusively to divided and protected lanes.\nI ride in Hamlton now, with my children riding on my bike with me. I also drive sometimes. I ride with them to daycare and kindergarten then continue on my way to work using divided bike lanes throughout the city on Bay St and Hunter St. Limiting cities' abilities to build things like this will force families like mine back into their cars - which will actually make traffic worse.\nBike lanes move more people per hour than a car lane can - a single two-way protected bike lane can move about 10 times as many people, and do so using less space, than a single lane of car traffic.\n"

        "comment": "I do not support the changes to bike lane frameworks. Bike Lanes are municipal jurisdiction, and should be kept under the control of cities. Additionally, I know many people who have chosen to bike rather than drive, because of new bike lanes. That's getting cars off of the road and reducing congestion. Lastly, cycle tracks save lives. These are people with friends, families, loved ones. I cannot imagine getting rid of life saving infrastructure to speed people up, especially when it doesn't even really speed people up! Most of these lanes are used for parked cars anyways. As an inexperienced driver, I find bike lanes more predictable, I know what will be there.\nTo reduce congestion I would appreciate more alternatives, such as better bike infrastructure but also, under provincial jurisdiction, more mass transit! I would like to see better transit funding and more lines to provide ways for me to travel without my car.\n"

        "comment": "This is a terrible, counterproductive, evidence-free policy that will get in the way of municipalities who actually want to address congestion by providing meaningful alternatives to driving.\nThe evidence that has been compiled over the last 10 years is conclusive: bike infrastructure does not slow emergency response, it helps local commerce, is significant more efficient for commercial deliveries in urban contexts, improves safety for cyclists/pedestrians/drivers and it makes cities accessible to people who cannot themselves drive.\nIf the province wants to get involved with cycling policy, it should focus on provincially significant areas such as reforming how the MTO designs highway interchanges, modifying the HTA to allow cyclists to proceed on leading pedestrian intervals, developing standards to facilitate emergency vehicle use of bike infrastructure (i.e. they should be wide enough for ambulances) and developing an e-bike rebate program comparable to the federal electric vehicle rebate. These are provincial areas of jurisdiction that could promote cycling, cashing in on the many health and economic benefits that comes from providing transportation more efficiently using active methods.\n"

        "comment": "This is not an evidence-based policy. It is silly and pathetic. Induced demand exists, and that goes both ways. Adding more car lanes makes more cars drive, making traffic worse. Adding more bike lanes (that are safe and well-designed) encourages more people to bike, which is more space-efficient, reduces car traffic by creating other travel options, reduces the need for wasteful and expensive car parking in urban areas (which could be used for denser housing!), has health benefits as an active form of transport, and is less carbon-polluting than auto-travel.\nIf Doug Ford wants to be mayor of Toronto and play Sim City to fix his daily commute, then he should run for Mayor. Passing this legislation at the provincial level and stomping all over the rights of municipalities to plan their own active transportation system just because Doug can't be bothered to bike or walk to work is ridiculous. Doug Ford's qualms about the inefficiency of his office commute in his over-sized polluting Suburban should not dictate whether I can commute to work safely by the method that works best for me. STAY IN YOUR LANE DOUG.\n"

        "comment": "I'm a daily cyclist, both for recreation and for my commute but I also own a car. For people like me, the bike lanes don't change how I ride. Or whether I do ride. If there is no bike lane, I ride in traffic. I don't care how drivers react and I have no fear being with cars. Drivers will have to wait behind me or go around. This will add to congestion even though I'm still on a bike. But for people who need the lanes, families, people with mobility issues, children, it's a safety issue that doesn't benefit anyone, not even drivers. Many people who ride bikes, like me, also drive. Removing lanes will make some of those people reconsider getting on their bike, adding to the congestion this plan is supposed to solve. The highways don't have bike lanes. The major thoroughfares in my city don't have bike lanes. Bike lanes are not the cause of congestion . Bike lanes and good transit are the only solution. Drivers are not stuck in traffic, they are traffic.\n"

        "comment": "I am a Toronto resident who uses the bike lanes fairly regularly. I use the bike share program as well. I bike to and from work, school, or to just get around. I find that it is a great way to exercise and help reduce traffic by not using my car.\nI am very against this proposal to get rid of bike lanes to help traffic congestion. It just does not work. These bike lanes help reduce automobile and bike crashes that can be fatal. It also is a safe and easy way for cyclist to get around town. I believe there should be many more bike lanes, especially on main artery streets.\nGetting rid of these bike lanes will not reduce traffic. Many of the streets that had bike lanes installed allowed cars to park on the street which reduced those streets to one lane roads anyway (eg. Bloor St). When vehicles were parked in the right hand lane, cars had to get over creating traffic and making it difficult to get around town.\nIt would be awful to get rid of these bike lanes. This city could be so much better. Not only are you taking away how many get around the city, you will potentially be creating more crashes between cyclists and vehicles. Do not get rid of these bike lanes.\n"

If I were to break down the various criticisms people have about bike lanes:\n-they take away lanes for cars=they do on paper but no street in old Toronto has ever had two proper thru-lanes in each direction. One lane is always clogged by street parking and the other one is littered with cars turning left. Re-designing streets provides the ability to give all users their own space\n-nobody uses them in the winter=well I use them and frankly Toronto hasn\u2019t had a winter with continuous snow on the ground since my childhood\n-they block emergency vehicles=they do no more than street parking does and last I checked parked cars can\u2019t move but bikes can so from a policy alternative proposal this doesn\u2019t make any sense either\n-I barely see cyclists=the numbers don\u2019t support this at all and I can say the same thing about any number of streets when it comes to cars but I don\u2019t see anyone saying we should ban those\n-it prevents access to business=again the numbers don\u2019t support this, small businesses are not a reliable source of information on this (they consistently over estimate when asked), non-motorists have to walk to businesses from stations, bike docks, etc all the time, motorists don\u2019t have some inherent right to be able to avoid that\nI hope the government is ready to accept the deaths of constituents because that will be the outcome of this policy.\n"

        "comment": "As an Ontario resident who travels throughout the province by car and by bicycle, I have a number of concerns regarding the proposed legislation to require provincial approval for the installation of new bike lanes and to compel municipalities to collect and provide information on existing bike lanes for the purpose of overriding previous decisions to enable these facilities to be provided.\nI recognize the importance of reducing gridlock on Ontario roads, and the benefits of saving drivers time and money.  However the proposed legislation fails to recognize the benefits of bike lanes that in many cases outweigh any impact to commuting time and traffic volumes.\nThe main benefit is safety.  Protected bicycle lanes have greatly improved the safety of roads where they have been installed.  This safety benefit includes not only cyclists, but all users (including motor vehicle drivers/passengers).  A U.S. study found that fatalities fell by over 38% in Chicago, 40% in Denver, nearly 50% in San Francisco, 60% in Seattle, and a whopping 75% in Portland, OR when protected bicycle lanes were implemented.  The proposed legislation removes a tool that municipalities can use to avoid injuries and fatalities on their roads.\nAnother benefit of bike lanes is their ability to facilitate shift in modes.  Within the width of a single lane of traffic, it is possible to move 9000 people per hour on a two-way cycling facility.  This greatly exceeds the capacity of a lane dedicated to automobile traffic (1000 - 1500 people per hour depending on traffic lights).  Many cities in North America have seen considerable numbers of cyclists when new protected cycling infrastructure was introduced.  This may include some new recreational traffic, but also includes users who have shifted from driving or taking transit.  These shifts reduce the number of cars on the road, which is the direct cause of traffic congestion in Ontario.\nIn addition, the 'specified criteria' for approval of new bike lanes is not transparent.  In many municipal cycling infrastructure projects, there may be a portion which requires lane narrowing, or the elimination of dangerous slip lanes or merges to avoid conflicts between cyclists and cars & trucks.  Would such changes to streets also require municipal approval?  Are you singling out bike lane projects to be treated differently from other road safety initiatives?   Will there be a maximum traffic level? (e.g. cycling projects cannot eliminate a lane of traffic on roads greater than 20,000 vehicles per day)   Will dedicated lanes for transit also be included in this legislation if they permit bicycles to use them?\nIn my opinion the proposed legislation is overbearing and creates additional red tape for municipalities who are seeking to find solutions to their traffic congestion and road safety issues.  Catering to personal vehicles above all else will provide additional incentive for Ontario residents to drive instead of using other modes of travel.  Ontario already subsidizes driving heavily through rebating license fees, provincial and municipal roadway maintainance costs, police and enforcement, as well as the health impacts from encouraging sedentary lifestyles and injuries and deaths from automobile collisions.  Ultimately, adding friction to the use of cycling as a solution to these issues will cost Ontario residents, both in terms of their health and well-being, and in their pocketbook over the short and the long-term.  I urge the Government of Ontario to reconsider this legislation.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is horrifying. Limiting bike lanes in cities is:\n1. A massive overreach of authority over municipalities, which are far better equipped to decide what\u2019s best for their residents\n2. Highly regressive. Sorry, the 60\u2019s are long gone. We need multiple modes of transportation now to accommodate higher density. The single car system is so obviously inefficient and unsustainable ~ there simply isn\u2019t enough room for the roads that would be needed if we still want farmland to feed ourselves. Bike lanes need to be connected, easy to access and plentiful.\n3. Costly, as bike lanes are generally cheaper to build and maintain than car infrastructure.\n4. Unsafe for everyone, as cars and bikes will not always be appropriately separated, putting cyclists at risk of injury and drivers at risk of hitting them.\n5. Environmentally unsound. Need I say it? Bikes use less energy and emit less carbon than any automobile, either ev or ice. We need more bike lanes to encourage their use. Do the teenagers of Ontario need to sue this government for not taking care of the planet?\n6. Unhealthy. Active transportation has the potential to improve health outcomes for adopters, saving money for our publicly-funded health system. Like seatbelts in cars - drivers didn\u2019t like that either!\n7. Unfriendly. Cities with good cycling infrastructure are more welcoming for visitors. Don\u2019t we want more tourism?\n8. An accessibility issue. Young people, old people, and low income people should not be trapped in their neighborhoods, unable to get to work or school because they don\u2019t have/can\u2019t drive a car and they can\u2019t safely get there by bike. Again, watch your liability here.\n9. A craven, cynical way to pander to drivers despite all good evidence that bike lanes are better for business, the environment, health, and safety. It\u2019s extremely sort-sighted and does nothing to support cities that are grappling with higher populations, but obviously you think it will buy you votes.\nBike lanes are not the problem affecting productivity. The lack of a robust, comprehensive public transit system in the GTA, across the province and across  the country, for that matter, definitely is. Stop picking on cyclists and govern for ALL Ontarians, not just those who want to spend inordinate amounts of their time stuck in traffic.\n"
