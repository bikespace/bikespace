        "comment": "Based on the fact that there is no credible study/information/precedent that suggests that bike lanes actually slow down traffic enough to be worrisome, this seems like a bureaucratic overreach to allow more provincial control that will appeal to a subset of voters. Passing this bill will just slow down the positive change that is happening in our cities, to keep people moving and allow people options to get around - outside of cars. There is no credible reason why this bill should be passed.\n"

        "comment": "Dear Premier Doug Ford and our beloved Ministers,\nRe. Mississauga - Bloor - Please STOP Car lane reduction\nPlease stop the removal of car lanes along the busy bloor street area in Applewood, Mississauga. Your law has come as a god sent blessing for all the hard working people of this area, whose only means of transportation is either the public bus or a car. We cannot afford Bikes and cannot afford to drop our children to school on bikes. This will lead to crowded side streets especially the Silverthorn school side roads where tiny kids are crossing with their parents. One lane (as per physical and chemical evidence) leads to more ground pressure on the road, road will get broken up and more repairs on the same patch of road. There will be no place for emergency vehicles in a single lane. One lane will not allow vehicles to turn safely in applewood school and Tomken school areas which puts kids safety at risk\nThis traffic is going to crown Cawthra road wherein traffic is anyways very hectic, and vehicles step up the gas to 65kms at a 50km zone to catch up on lost time. The cars are ever increasing on the road and will create choke points and being a biker myself, bloor is very hectic and notwithstanding the well meaning bike lanes, vehicles are going to go very close to the bikers which may result in accidents.\nThe sidewalks in many areas are way too broad. The sidewalk itself can be bifurcated into 2 lanes one for walking and one for biking. We have not seen many bikers in the area and bikers never use the lane in winters which basically leads to a wasted space for 4 to 5 months in a year\nRear-end collisions are the most common accidents between vehicles.\nThe 3 second rule wherein the distance between 2 vehicles should be around 3 secs will be bypassed and everyone wants to reach their destination. In winters there will be more collisions leading to a complete breakdown of traffic. Even tow trucks will have a tough time bypassing traffic to reach the accident site. Medical ambulances frequently use this route and emergency vehicles will not be able to pass through. Bloor, Yonge etc. one of the longest roads in Canada and have been built with a traffic in mind by our planners. We trying to reduce the lanes is frankly an insult to their foresight and planning. Instead of cutting down, we should add additional lanes for traffic. It is quite insulting to see hard working middle class like us having to struggle everyday and also adding insult to injury be taking away the only mode of transport for us i.e. the car we drop our kids and go to work. Also the residents will back up from their driveway onto bike lanes leading to more accidents.  You are our leader and please consider this as a request from someone who has always cheered for your and your leadership.\nRegards,\nNish and family\nApplewood area, Mississauga\n"

        "comment": "In favour of bike lanes and one centre turning lane\nWe need secure bike lanes. I saw a man with a kiddy trailer on a bike on bloor street. It was very dangerous!!!\nBloor is a local road west of Dixie.   One way each way and a centre turning lane is perfect for this street west of Dixie to central parkway.  Through traffic goes along Dundas and burnhamthorpe and should be discouraged to go along bloor.  Add speed bumps along bloor from Dixie to central parkway please.\nPlease continue with your plans.\nI live on cedar creek - difficult to turn left onto bloor. With a left turn lane this will help.\nWhen applewood rate payers president came around with the survey they did not explain the options, just that this is a horrible thing and the poor people on bloor will lose their parking soaces and a chunk of their property.  And to sign here to support this poor woman - who was in attendance when the survey was presented and she was outraged. People felt like they had to sign it.  I did.\nAthena did not explain what the options were when she presented the survey - it is not accurate as a result\nPlease hold another community meeting explaining the options properly. Or send out a paper notice explaining it.  We only get regular communication from applewood ratepayers.  Which has their own spin on things.\n"

        "comment": "As we continue to prioritize the safety, health, and sustainability of our communities, preserving and expanding Ontario\u2019s bike lanes is essential. Bike lanes aren\u2019t just lines on the road; they represent a commitment to providing safe and accessible transportation for cyclists of all ages and abilities, reducing traffic congestion, and contributing to cleaner air and lower emissions.\nIn recent years, Ontario\u2019s bike lanes have become a lifeline for many who commute, exercise, and explore our cities and towns. These lanes create a buffer that protects cyclists from vehicle traffic, encourages active lifestyles, and helps reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. By maintaining and improving this infrastructure, we are also supporting local businesses, creating opportunities for tourism, and promoting a more livable and connected urban landscape.\nDismantling or reducing bike lanes undermines the progress we've made toward a greener and more inclusive Ontario. We urge decision-makers to consider the long-term benefits of bike lanes to our communities and to commit to making Ontario a leader in sustainable and people-centered urban design. Let\u2019s keep Ontario\u2019s streets safe, healthy, and accessible for everyone by preserving and expanding our bike lane network.\n"

        "comment": "This is one of the most asinine law ideas I have ever heard of. Managing bike lanes is purely municipal jurisdiction. The provincial government should have no power over how a local municipality manages its roads. If you really want to reduce gridlock and congestion, then invest in better public transit systems. Give funding for more local trains, dedicated bus lanes, and incentivize people to use bikes & other non-motor vehicle forms for transportation. This law does nothing to reduce gridlock, and only makes it harder for local governments to actually make a difference.\n"

By making roads more unsafe for cyclists (removing bike lanes) more trips will be taken by car, and there will be less cyclists on the road. The needs of the communities where bike lanes are being installed are best understood on the city level, and should remain under the control of cities who have installed and maintain the cycling infrastructure.\n"

        "comment": "To Whom it may concern,\nI use the Yonge bike lane almost every day.  I do not use the Bloor bike very much as I really have no need to travel that way.  When I need to go west or east, I use my bike and take the Bloor bike lane.  I then use normal roads to get to my destination.  If I could not use my bike I would be forced to drive adding to the congestion problem!  I view this proposal of removing the bike lanes as a weak political move.  I think the city should expand bike lanes and promote more people to take their bikes.  This would lead to less cars on the road and easier traveling for those that just really need to take their car.   Thanks for the opportunity to express my view.\n"

        "comment": "Bloor Street- Mississauga\nAt last! Some common sense being applied by a government. The  majority of residents of Wards 3 & 4 in Mississauga do not want 2 lanes of traffic removed from Bloor Street. An overwhelming majority of the residents directly impacted by the removal of the traffic lanes are opposed to the plan due to safety concerns. Despite the many, many objections to this silly idea, the Ward 3 councilor refuses to take the concerns of local residents seriously and had pushed this plan against their wishes. Aided and abetted by other councilors and the former major,  who would will not be impacted directly by the proposed changes but feel they can roll over the local residents because of the ongoing war against vehicles.\nBravo Premier Ford for taking as stand against the woke ideology that pervades most levels of government these days.\n"

        "comment": "The key line/fault in the proposal is this: \u2018Ontario is looking to fight gridlock and get drivers where they need to go faster\u2019\nThe proposal should not be \u2018driver\u2019 centric\u2026..you want to ease gridlock by getting \u2018commuters\u2019 where they need to go, whether those commuters be drivers, cyclists or transit user. Only by taking a balanced/holistic approach can you be successful\u2026.this would lead to the thinking of implementing bike lanes where they make sense to facilitate/encourage commuting by bike this reducing cars and lessening the burden on Transit.\nI commute to downtown via all three methods depending on weather/conditions/need and my preferred (and fastest) option is always my bicycle using the Dundas bike lane.\nI can tell you first hand that many of the bike lanes in TO do not make the best sense and I would support removal of some IF it was done as part of a broader strategy to encourage commuting via bike by implementing a better/broader system of connected lanes/corridors/network vs the patch work network we currently have.\nRather than being combative toward cyclist the Ford Government should be meeting with cycling groups/drivers and the TTC to determine what makes sense and works for ALL commuters.\n"

Premier Ford the street is so busy that there should\nbe NO Bike lanes at all on that stretch of Bloor Street from Etobicoke border to Cawthra Road and\nbeyond.  City's  proposal 6 the city was going to implement would have necessitated reducing busy\nBloor Street from 4 lanes to 2 lanes and a 3rd lane in the middle for turning.  Traffic gridlock for sure\nnot to mention accidents from the 3rd lane being used by overtaking motorists.\nThe City's old Proposal 5 which they had rejected was for building bike lanes on the sidewalk and on\nour driveways.  This would have resulted in many speeding cyclists being hit and injured or killed as\nresidents on Bloor Street, mostly seniors's cars entered and exited their homes.  The fatal accidents will happen on the driveways of more than 120 homes on Bloor Street.\nPremier Ford please speak to Councillor Fonseca and Councillor Tedjko, both cycling enthusiasts that\nNO BIKE LANES AT ALL BE ALLOWED ON BLOOR STREET.  There is Cherry Hill Park and bike lanes could\nbe installed in the side street for cyclist enthusiasts to enjoy their bikes without being a danger to themselves first and to the seniors who have homes on Bloor Street all, homes have driveways exiting\ndirectly into Bloor Street.\n"

As a resident of Toronto, we sold our family's second car and now use a bike as our second family vehicle because of the biking routes and infrastructure now available in the city. We have put 5,500 km on our bicycle in 2 years, which would have been kms driven in the city and extra emissions for our air quality. We take our kids to school and the library on the bike, and get groceries with the bike. Global cases like Copenhagen, Paris, and Montreal show that biking infrastructure reduces congestion. A CBC report proves this empirically (see URL Link)\nI am horrified that our government would spend time creating legislation that would limit biking infrastructure growth because active transportation will be essential to move the people around the GTA that we are expected to have in the coming years.\nPLEASE focus on something more constructive, and please leave municipalities to plan their own infrastructure. Follow the successful programs from other regions around the world and please recognize the important role that bike lanes will play in reducing congestion and moving people around modern cities in the future.\n"
