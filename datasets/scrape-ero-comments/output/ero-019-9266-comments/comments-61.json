        "comment": "Horrible idea based on personal preference of individuals, instead of uniform and standardized policy. Not based on any scientific or sound policy analysis. Essentially a ban on bike lanes as it will be based on the whims of an individual and will make it impossible to have a connected network. This will make Ontario the only jurisdiction in the world that is effectively banning bike lanes. Every other major city in the world is expanding bike lanes as an alternative to driving, but Ontario thinks it is special and is doing the opposite as the rest of the world. Also a hypocritical move by the government to say that they cannot dictate municipal housing policy, but they can micromanage bike lanes on individual streets.\n"

We use bike lanes to run errands and get to school. The removal of bike lanes in my community would mean that people like me would be forced to drive, putting more cars on the road and reducing the safety and quality of life for our children.\n"

        "comment": "I am opposed to parts of Bill 212 affecting bike lanes. This legislation is an overreach of provincial authority and strips away local democratic decision making.\nBike lanes are necessary infrastructure that should be left to individual municipalities to plan and build. Furthermore, existing bike lanes should be left untouched.\nThe rationale - that traffic is bad and that bike lanes make it worse - is unsupported by traffic management experts. It is clear that building roads, adding lanes, does nothing but induce further demand, further car usage.\nThe Province needs to focus on improving transit and all other modes of transport. Encouraging cycling takes cars off the road, and bike lanes are one of the best tools for that encouragement.\nBill 212's attack on bike lanes should not stand.\n"

        "comment": "This act will result in fewer people being willing to choose a bike for short trips, and instead use the car, leading to yet another car on the road. How many times have the Ontario government added another lane to a highway, promising to fix traffic forever, only to have traffic be worse upon completion?\nThis is the gambler\u2019s fallacy - one more game, then I\u2019ll hit the jackpot; one more lane, then traffic will be solved. Since when do our lawmakers care so little about the well-being of Ontarians, that they\u2019re willing to ignore any studies on traffic or case studies of regions that have actually reduced traffic for a growing population? This act is effectively a ban on bike lanes, at a time when more and more people are considering bikes for their small trips.\nThe number one reason those hesitant people do not ride a bike is because of the threat to their safety on the road. Without a sidewalk, drivers hit pedestrians. Without a protected bike lane, drivers hit people on bikes. This is a death sentence to cyclists and a sure fire way to turn Ontario into Los Angeles - endless traffic, highways as far as the eye can see. How bleak.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal seems to be an overstepping of provincial boundaries that fails the address the issues it states concern over. It would need a complete overhaul to properly address the issues facing Ontarians today.\nWhile it is my belief that all levels of government (municipal, provincial, federal) should be working together, the wording of the bill indicates that the primary intent is to stifle the decision-making powers of municipal governments. The need for provincial approval to introduce bike lanes would hamper the progress required to increase transit efficiency in urban areas, and introduce new overhead to the provincial government, decreasing it's efficiency too. A better approach would be to proactively provide municipalities with data collection tools to monitor transit efficiencies, rather than requiring it to exist as a prerequisite to development.\nWhile Ontario is largely car-dependent, this car dependency introduces issues in urban areas, such as traffic, or gridlock as mentioned by the bill. the simplest way to remove traffic would be to remove or reduce the cars themselves, as they comprise the bottleneck to transport. Accidents, and traffic are a reasonable concern mentioned in the bill, but they are both caused by an overabundance of cars.\nCars are often an inefficient mode of transit. The average car is not fully occupied, meaning alternative methods of transport (public transit, cycling, walking) are generally more space-efficient, allowing for greater throughput and the potential elimination of bottlenecks. This is especially the case for commuter transit during peak hours, which often run close to full capacity. Long-distance transport could be better served through dedicated public transit (i.e., a train).\nBicycle use should be promoted as a method to reduce traffic. They occupy less space per person than the average car, meaning even when a bicycle is involved in traffic, it often has a lower footprint, meaning it will likely block fewer people, or allow for faster flow of traffic.\nThe people of Ontario need a bill that addresses the shortcomings of a car-based infrastructure, and promotes modes of transit that are more efficient. In doing so, everyone is benefitted, as the most important road users (trucks, emergency services) have less traffic to contend with, and the general populace may enjoy a better selection of transit modes to go where they need to be.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes have been an important part for all my life and I value them dearly here in Toronto. I've lived in cities around the world where bikes are simply a part of transportation and daily life, not a political debate. Coming from Vancouver, I was dismayed at the comparative state of the bike infrastructure when I first moved to Toronto in 2019, but since then I have been so incredibly impressed by and grateful for the city's efforts to build new lanes.\nAfter a knee surgery last year that left me housebound for over a month, biking was one of the first activities I was cleared to do. I still remember how freeing it felt to hop on my bike for a ride down the Harbord and Bloor bike lanes with my new knee. I was overwhelmed with gratitude and relief, especially at protected segments where I truly felt anxiety-free about my safety.\nThere are a plethora of evidence that proves bike lanes do not increase traffic congestion, reduce greenhouse emissions, and improves local economy. Anecdotally, these are all true to my personal experience as both a cyclist and car owner. I've visited shops I would've only driven past otherwise, and shaven hours off my daily commute by taking my bike rather than car. I've unfortunately observed the grid lock here in Toronto are happening in all arteries and roads, regardless of the # of car lanes available. Taking away the narrow bike lanes would not meaningfully improve car traffic, but it would absolutely ruin so many cyclist's daily life - not to mention their personal safety.\nEnding on a somber note, my high school band teacher, also an avid cyclist, had his life sadly taken away by a negligent driver while cycling. He was the kind of guy who left such a big impact on everyone in his life that I'm still shaken by the news even years after being his student. Deaths are so common in our world that we forget how devastating it can be, so I've attached his obituary here to hopefully remind us of the preciousness of life. Bike infrastructure absolutely can and will protect so many people, cyclists and drivers alike, from tragedies like this.\n"

        "comment": "I'm a daily driver. However, this is due to the fact that public transit is not accessible enough between where I live versus where I work and the roads don't feel safe biking. Most streets either require you to ride on the road with car traffic (there are a lot of dangerous drivers these days) or on the sidewalk where the bikes are now a danger to pedestrians.\nI believe we need to either have dedicated lanes for bikes, electric scooters, etc. with a significant separation from vehicles (a few small posts aren't going to stop a car). Or else we need to make sidewalks wide enough to accommodate both pedestrian and bikes without collisions.\nAlso each city and town has their own unique circumstances, needs and wants when it comes to local traffic control. Therefore, I believe it is more appropriate for these types of decisions to be made by the local government. I have also not seen any major consultations with the general public about the issues this legislation proposes and am concerned if it truly represents the voice and will of the people, or their best interests. I would also like to see some studies publicly posted about the actual impacts of these bike lanes so we can make sure we can make informed decisions instead of simply based off emotional sentiments and with consideration only to personal circumstances.\nFinally the building and then teardown of infrastructure like this is a massive waste of our tax money and resources that could be better used to fund our public transit, hospitals, schools and other critical infrastructure to allow for a greater benefit.\n"

        "comment": "I cycle from East York to my workplace in Downtown Toronto, five days a week, for a least 8 months of the year, and cycle most days during the winter with warm clothes and studded tires. I cycle around Toronto to run errands and for social events and this almost eliminates my need for car transportation except in instances where I need to transport heavy cargo or multiple members of my family. Radically reducing my dependence on car travel and the transit makes space for those who have longer journeys and cargo transportation needs, and thus reduces carbon emissions, lowers air pollution, reduces noise, and traffic congestion. Bike lanes along the main arteries assist in my safety, heath and wellness when I'm a cyclist, and make my job simpler as a driver by keeping cyclists separated from vehicle traffic. If the Province moves to remove bicycle lanes, this will have a negative impact on the environment, negative impact on citizen's willingness to cycle, and increase traffic. Bicycles take less space to store and make, they don't make significant amounts of noise. The health benefits of cycling should not be underestimated and the burdens on the healthcare system, especially if I can continue to cycle, serve the community and my family. All of this would be especially challenging if I'm hit by a car and injured or killed. Surely, bikes are not holding up traffic on the 401, DVP, Gardiner, 427, 410 and most other places there are significant challenges, and this move would be setting us backwards in Ontario.\n"

        "comment": "Why is the government wasting Ontario taxpayer money on removing existing municipal infrastructure that allows commuters to avoid driving to work? Every commuter who cannot get to work via public transit, bikes, or walking is forced to drive; every commuter who is forced to drive creates more gridlock. This is simple common sense. We are already facing a cost-of-living crisis that this government is barely interested in mitigating. The least you could do is spend our money responsibly.\n"

Bike lanes encourage a healthier lifestyle. Bike lanes reduce gridlock by taking more cars off the road.\nNo to more highways. No to increased car lanes.\n"

        "comment": "Requiring provincial approval of bike lanes is not only wild over-reach into municipal affairs; it is also entirely unproductive. There is abundant evidence for the phenomenon of \"induced demand\": additional lanes on roads lead, over a period of a few years, to more traffic. Meanwhile additional bike lanes lead to more cyclists on the road. It is important to note that this effect on cycling has been found in places like Montreal, that are colder and hillier than many Ontario cities including Toronto. There's no reason we can't do it here.\nSome studies found new bike lanes in Toronto added a couple of minutes of commute time, when comparing a mid-pandemic baseline to the present. Leaving aside the validity concerns of the methodology, it is simply asinine to claim that those few minutes are deeply meaningful to commuters or that this impact outweighs the benefits of safer active transport.\nWe don't need more lanes for traffic. We don't need more highways. We need major investment into public transit and cycling infrastructure within cities and across regions. I commuted between Hamilton and Toronto by train regularly for years--but if I took a job in Guelph, Waterloo, or other regional cities, I would be in yet another vehicle jamming the highways instead. Now I work in Hamilton and commute by bicycle--but if the safe lanes that I rely on are removed, I'll be in yet another vehicle clogging the roads.\nDrivers win when fewer people are on the road. So rather than building more driving lanes, let's focus on getting people out of cars and into public and active transport. There simply isn't a rationale for imposing restrictions on bike lanes beyond cheap political points-scoring.\n"

WALKABLE CITIES SHOULD ALWAYS ALWAYS PRIORITIZE THE SAFETY OF ITS PEDESTRIANS.\nTaking away safe bike lanes spends millions of taxpayers' money for no reason. You do not have a reason to take away bike lanes in areas of heavy traffic. It makes roads unsafe for both drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians everywhere.\n"
