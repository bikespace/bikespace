        "comment": "We can't have it both ways - protecting bikers \"one death is one too many\" Does Mr. Ford remember saying that?  I actually drive a car and take TTC.  Bikes are another part of our transportation needs.\nThe trick is to find a balance between them all to keep people moving.  I like the separation of bikes from cars (bike lanes - yes!)  I am less stressed driving by bikers.  Too late after you hit someone to say \"gee wish the bike lanes were in place\".  Don't get me started on people using scooters - e-bikes that travel at quite a speed and people do push it.  Without bike lanes to separate us, a pothole or stone could cause a swerve or fall and right in front of a car without the barriers. Just saying.\nThe biggest error here is REVERSING  bike lanes already established.  Huge waste of money when we have other needs to throw money at - homeless, hospital workers etc etc.)\nStick to a moratorium to halt building more until reviews & consultations over this has been done.  You will piss off less people in Toronto (aside from those who only drive and don't want to be inconvenienced).  As for the others who drive but like safety, are we not part of the people you serve??\nNext - if you want to reverse the bike lanes already put in place  NO WAY.  Torontonians have paid for them to be put in and it's safer for bikes and ultimately drivers of cars - preventing accidents.\nIF Mr. Ford, wants to remove them , then the Province can hire the contractors and pay for all the expenses for doing that but not charge it back to Toronto.\nWhat a WASTE of money $  (YES Mr. Ford you do waste our tax payer money every time you reverse a program (usually one that isn't your own) or set one up without proper consultation of tax payers or kill a program in the middle of the term which hurts people in those programs but then perhaps you don't look that far into the ramifications of your decisions.)\nJust a reminder Who sold Hwy 407 for less money than it took to build it when it was brand new and not needing maintenance for a while.  A self motivated move that did NOT benefit the taxpayers of Ontario.  Initially Spanish ownership was about 60% and i bet they took a profit from the toll fees.\nTolls were suppose to be charged for the first 30 years until the cost to build the highway was paid off and then it would become a free public highway like the 401.  Hmmm wonder if that will actually happen.  Oh  and Ontario Gov't (Mr. Ford) is thinking of buying it back, now that it will need maintenance etc etc.  If bought back will the tolls go away - not holding my breath.\nThanks for letting me comment.\n"

        "comment": "I live in downtown Toronto and I regularly need to drive to Scarborough as the primary caregiver for an 88 year old senior. I strongly support dedicated separated bike lanes on the routes that I take. It makes the roads safer for cyclists, safer and more efficient for cars and trucks, reduces the ability of unsafe drivers to travel at excessive speeds (endangering pedestrians, cyclists, and other motorists), and reduces pollution by giving a safer option for those who choose to commute or otherwise journey by bicycle. Traffic congestion is worsened much more by construction projects that take up entire lanes (and prevent any other user from accessing them, often for multiple years) than by well designed and maintained dedicated bike lanes.\n"

And bike riders need to be protected from cars.  Too many riders have been killed.  If we have safe bike lanes more people will ride bikes, but it takes time for the culture to change.\nAnd if the Ford government insists on removing them, they must pay Toronto\u2019s cost of installation as well as removal.\n"

Without bike lanes, traffic on roads will be increased and slow down as cyclists that are displaced will cycle with vehicles on main roads.

        "comment": "hello Ontario\nPlease do not remove the bike lanes.  The dedicated bike lanes make cycling on the city's busy downtown streets much, much safer.  The safety, health & wellness of bikers should not be sacrificed to make car traffic a little faster in the city.   On a recent bike ride along Danforth Ave, I was very grateful for the bike lane, which protected me from traffic.\nI would add that the bike lanes were implemented by the City of Toronto.  The province has not explained why the province is seeking to assume responsibility for something that is clearly the city's 'lane'.  To use the expression, the province should stay in its lane.  The province is free to introduce bike lanes on highways, or not, as it would see fit.\nCities the world over are expanding their bike lanes for reasons of the safety of bikers, to make biking easier for cyclist. For the province to remove the city's bike lanes would be regressive, and telling the people of Toronto that the province has little regard for cyclists, pedestrians or the environment.\n"

        "comment": "While I support the concept of dedicated bike lanes for safety reasons, I do not believe the decisions as to where they were placed and how many were erected were made with sensible judgment. The largest reason against their use for reliable commuting purposes is that bike lanes are not particularly helpful or welcoming for almost half a year (whether that be from snow, cold, or miserable). We do not enjoy the climate of Europe or most of the US (even NYC), where commuting using bikes as a regular form of transportation is much more realistic for many more months of the year. Therefore, finding solutions that can better utilize it over 12 months is a far more effective strategy. Safe, speedy, and reliable public transport that makes it quick and efficient to move around the city is the biggest issue this city faces in shuttling the most people for the 12 months of the year, and all our transportation resources should be focused on solving this major issue first and foremost (with the additional benefit of environmental considerations). I would also be curious if the increase in use is due to Uber vs. commuters or those who actually need to get from A to B. There are some major streets in our city that we just need to be able to go north/south, or east/west in a car (even parents with multiple children no longer enjoy the benefit of purely neighbourhood-focused activities) or on a bus. \"If you build it, they will come\" was taken to an extreme by the city, and the spillover effect of more cars in neighbours to make up the time, finding faster routes, is underappreciated. I am annoyed that it will cost money to rip it all out, and I particularly dislike the overreach of the provincial government, as it's a slippery slope. Still, these bike lanes should never have gone in on some major arteries. They should be looked at in the context of the overall strategy to deal with the unbearable traffic situation in the city and surrounding area, not just during rush hour but also at all times of the day. It's not only the bike lanes at fault for our traffic, but it also needs to be assessed more than just the hyper-locality of the city and for a much longer term than any level of government four years in power.\n"

        "comment": "Let municipal governments decide where they want bike lanes! The provincial government should not be overriding their choices!  Ontario's cities have lots of car drivers, more than bike riders, so if bike lanes are seriously blocking car traffic, city governments would not create them. Cities have both car drivers and bike riders (many people both) and they need to provide safe access on major roads for bike riders. Bike lanes provide that safety while major streets without bike lanes are much more dangerous for bike riders.\nDo not remove any Toronto bike lanes!  If there is a strong case for their removal, our municipal politicians can vote for their removal! The reason big lanes have been created is because inhabitants of our cities want them, and almost invariably appreciate them when they are created.\n"

        "comment": "The Ontario Premier's plan to remove highly used bike lanes in Toronto reveals several contradictions and short-sighted thinking:\n1. **Worsening congestion while claiming to reduce it**: Removing bike lanes is likely to increase traffic congestion rather than alleviate it. Studies have shown that bike lanes can actually improve traffic flow by providing safe alternatives to driving[3][4]. The city staff report estimates that removing bike lanes would cause months of construction-related delays, ironically creating more congestion[5].\n2. **Fiscal irresponsibility**: The Premier claims to be fiscally conservative, yet this plan would waste millions in taxpayer money. Removing existing bike lanes on just three streets is estimated to cost $48 million, not including the $27 million already spent on installing them[5]. This is a significant expense with questionable benefits.\n3. **Undermining local governance**: While the Premier often advocates for reduced government intervention, this move represents an unprecedented intrusion into municipal affairs and urban planning[3]. It contradicts principles of local decision-making and community input.\n4. **Ignoring safety and sustainability**: The plan disregards the safety benefits of bike lanes and goes against global trends towards more sustainable and livable cities. It prioritizes car traffic over the diverse transportation needs of urban residents[4].\n5. **Misdiagnosing the problem**: The Premier blames bike lanes for congestion, but city data suggests construction projects, including delayed provincial transit initiatives, are the primary cause of traffic issues[5]. This indicates a failure to address the root causes of congestion.\n6. **Contradicting economic evidence**: While claiming to support businesses, the plan ignores evidence that bike lanes can boost local economies. Business groups like the Bloor Annex BIA have reported economic benefits tied to bike lanes[3].\nBy pursuing this policy, the Premier is contradicting principles of evidence-based policymaking, fiscal responsibility, local governance, and sustainable urban development. It appears to be a politically motivated move that may ultimately prove counterproductive to its stated goals.\nCitations:\n[1] https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/toronto-bike-lane-removal-city-c\u2026\n[2] https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ont-bike-lanes-1.7369898\n[3] https://momentummag.com/ontario-government-move-to-limit-bike-lanes-spa\u2026\n[4] https://www.nationalobserver.com/2024/10/16/news/city-toronto-advocates\u2026\n[5] https://globalnews.ca/news/10868485/toronto-bike-lane-removal-cost-cong\u2026\n[6] https://globalnews.ca/news/10823334/ontario-pay-remove-bike-lanes/\n[7] https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/bike-lanes-removal-doug-ford-1.7\u2026\n"

They are dead because they were hit by careless drivers who were in a hurry to get somewhere.\nI took my bicycle to work for many years taking my car off the street, reducing air pollution and improving my overall health and alertness in the morning at work. I was far more productive and healthier because of biking to and from work.\nI walk along Bloor Street in the West end and having fewer cars on the road due to bike lanes, along with more bikes have improved air quality, so I am much more likely to walk and shop at my local shops.\nDo not allow Doug Ford to reduce bike lanes in Toronto. He is a very short sighted politician.\nHealthy safe bikers are far less likely to put a strain on our healthcare system, increase air pollution, or gridlock our traffic.\nMore bike lanes are needed, not less.\n"

        "comment": "I'm truly sorry if the Premier is upset that his travel time to his office at Queen's Park is taking a little longer than it seemed to take a couple of years ago: he blames this on the 'bike lanes' on Bloor Street. Might I suggest he takes the TTC every so often, just to see how the other 'half' get around in downtown Toronto. Or he could take a bike.\nI don't ride a bike any longer, since I have decrepit knees: I drive a car along Bloor often, from Royal York to Runnymede, and tolerate the reduced speed well, but my husband does, and uses his bike to run errands, and generally get around our part of the town. He finds the bike lanes very useful, and he feels safer doing so with the bike lanes.\nYes, I agree that at 'rush hour' Bloor street from the Old Mill to Jane Street is congested, but I would place the blame largely on the difficult triangle intersection at Bloor and Jane, where the traffic lights rarely coordinate, often causing backlogs on Bloor. And of course, presently, there's construction on the north-west corner with condominium construction: the construction takes up a lane on the north side of Bloor.\nIn short, if you're fortunate to have someone drive you, use the time you're in traffic to do something other than complain how long it's taking to get somewhere. Use the time wisely. Read, listen to the radio, podcasts, or just think of how you're going to spend your $200. I'd argue that lengthened traffic times are in part a function of how many more cars there are on the road--even since 1986--when I moved back to Toronto, where I was born. Cheer up Doug.\n"

        "comment": "I am a resident of Toronto and I do not support the province's plan for the removal of bike lanes. The issue of bike lanes is inherently a municipal issue, and it should remain that way. City council is elected by the citizens of the city and councilors are in the best position to make decisions regarding local bike lanes. I think it would be an abuse of power by the province to undo what the city has done.\nWith respect to the issue of reducing gridlock, it has not been proven that bike lanes contribute to gridlock. Before going through with the removal of bike lanes (the execution of which surely would increase gridlock), shouldn't it be shown that this is the right course of action? Given the enormous disruption to traffic that the removal of bike lanes would cause, not to mention the enormous expense, why is the government so intent on going ahead with this? This plan put forth by the government is irresponsible.\n"

Mr. Ford might seriously consider ceasing to meddle in municipal affairs.\nRipping out  the established bicycle lanes is a waste of money for the taxpayers of Ontario.

Are there other purposes for these scarce tax dollars, such as keeping hospital emergency rooms open?\nSix cyclists have died on the streets of Toronto so far in 2024. Bike lanes increase safety for cyclists, and encourage this environmentally friendly form of transportation.\nIf Mr. Ford wants to decrease traffic congestion, money can be invested in better public transportation.
