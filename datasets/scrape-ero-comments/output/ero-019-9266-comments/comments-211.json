        "comment": "This legislation will not benefit Ontarians. The province will spend our hard earned money to undo infrastructure improvements. After these expenditures, traffic will not improve, as the root cause of traffic is vehicles and not bicycles. Finally, removing bicycle lanes will make it more dangerous to take alternative options to driving, which will ultimately make traffic worse.\n"

        "comment": "\"Establishing a framework\" - adding additional red tape that prevents cities from making effective choices on climate goals, congestion management, and managing their own streets - is wasteful, inefficient, and will be ineffective.\nBeyond that - tearing our existing bike lanes will cause months of additional traffic snarls along main and side roads and cost millions of dollars, all for the goal of establishing one more lane of traffic flow. Study after study - and endless driver experience - has revealed that just adding one more lane results in one more full lane moving people slowly and ineffectively - this is borne out by decades of history in Los Angeles, New York, Boston, Toronto, and numerous other cities. If your goal is to increase ground level emissions of fossil fuel pollutants and engine noise while not actually addressing congestion, you're on the right track.\nThere are a number of more effective and more environmentally responsible ways you could look at this:\n- Increase transit service frequency\n- Lower point of service cost for transit to incentivize ridership\n- Establish more dedicated transit corridors like the highly effective King Street pilot\n- Establish a tax credit for people that use transit on a regular basis\n- Incentivize remote work to keep people out of the downtown core when their job can be effectively completed remotely\n- Improve enforcement of existing traffic laws to keep traffic flowing efficiently\n- Remove or increase the cost of street parking and increase the penalty for parking outside of posted hours to keep existing lanes of traffic available during busy hours\n- Implement congestion tolls/entrance fees for people entering the city in private vehicles during peak hours\nCities of the future must be built to minimize the use of single-occupant private vehicles. These devices are inefficient in terms of fuel consumption and road space consumption and they spend more than half their time parked, empty, and useless.\nIn short and in summation, this framework should be scrapped before implementation.\n"

        "comment": "From what we've seen in other cities and research, dedicated bike lanes aren\u2019t just about helping cyclists\u2014they actually help ease traffic for everyone. Separating bikes from cars keeps things safer and reduces congestion, as cyclists have their own lanes instead of mixing with cars in traffic. Don't forget that cyclists are still legally allowed to shared roads (even without bikelines).\nUniversity\u2019s bike lanes are some of the best we\u2019ve seen in the city, with solid barriers and safe crossings, making it a great option for people who commute downtown by bike, especially those working at nearby hospitals. Removing these lanes feels like a step backward. It\u2019s worth considering the benefits these lanes bring to the city\u2019s traffic flow and overall safety.\nSeveral meta-analyses and studies in scientific journals confirm that bike lanes reduce traffic congestion, improve road safety, and enhance urban mobility overall. Research across cities like Portland, Beijing, and Toronto demonstrates that separating bike lanes from car lanes lowers the potential for accidents and road bottlenecks. Attached references.\n"

        "comment": "This is objectively a terrible proposal for all Ontarians. In cities, bikes are a fast, convenient, and cheap way to get around. And in places like Toronto, they are often faster than any other means of transport. Removing bike lanes will only make traffic worse because driving cars is far less space efficient than all other modes of transit - most cars only have a single occupant in them, and take up a space of over 10' x 25' when accounting for the space between cars, compared to the tiny size of most bikes. Removing bike lanes isn't going to remove cyclists either, it will just make roads more unsafe for both cyclists and drivers. And once enough bike infrastructure exists in cities, we will see a decrease in car traffic, which inversely will help those who do want to drive because those that don't can choose to bike or take another means of transit instead. Please listen to Ontarians on this. Bike lanes are not the issue here, cars are.\nSigned, a car enthusiast\n"

        "comment": "The Ontario Governments proposal to alleviate gridlock in Ontario towns and cities by controlling not just when and where a bicycle lane is built on municipal roads, but that existing, successful bicycle lane infrastructure be removed is flawed, regressive, dangerous and stupid.\nFirstly, data. The conservative governments claims that bicycle infrastructure negatively affects the movement of emergency vehicles is flawed and false. Data from emergency responders tracking response travel times on routes before and after the installation of bicycle infrastructure shows, at worst, a negligible affect and, at best, a beneficial effect. Correlating any perceived negative affect to the presence of a bicycle lane, whether people are obviously using it or not, is both moot and spurious.\nAn additional point of data that is also frequently brought up is that bicycle lanes are bad for local businesses: where will people park if not right in front of the store they're trying to go to? This is a legitimate concern for business owners on busy streets where the street parking may be reduced to make way for bicycle infrastructure, and one where the only promise planners can make is a \"wait-and-see\" approach to how their business will be affected. This is a real risk. However, studies from business associations across North America and in Europe on affected areas that are built densely enough largely show increases in business transactions, dollars earned and local taxes earned.\nSecond, towns and cities exist to maximize human-human interactions and commerce. Streets and roads comprise the largest amount of land collectively held by the public in any town or city. Congestion is not a bad thing inherently - it shows you that a city is alive and well. However, for the past 70 years we have seen more and more of this civic infrastructure be used exclusively by cars that get larger and faster, in turn taking up more and more space for their safe movement and storage at the expense of all else. There is a diminishing return on this agreement. Cars do have an economy of their own, but in no way do cars alone facilitate or maximize the commerce of a city, or increase the human-human interactions within it. By giving the automobile more city space in the name of commerce, but at the actual expense of it is foolish and wishful - this is costing our cities, and even some of our towns. Further, to give more urban space to the automobile at the expense of human-human interactions is wrong and regressive. As was mentioned above, commerce increases when people are not in their cars, when they are moving at human speeds they can easily and safely stop on their bicycle or on foot to enter a business or chat with a friend. When we can do this, human-human interactions increase, which is of net psycho-social benefit. We need to move people and goods using as many modes as we safely can as efficiently as we can. Giving more of the road to single occupancy vehicles moves in the opposite direction.\nThird, safety. While people can and do fall off bicycles, and it can be catastrophic when they do, they are a fairly safe and exceedingly efficient means of moving around. They take up very little space and require few calories to operate and have low lifetime CO2e and zero toxic emissions when in motion. Because they are human powered and because they facilitate human-human interactions they also have an added benefit of increasing our physical and psychological health. This has a further net benefit to society of decreasing the costs and demands on our public healthcare system and maximizing human potential for commerce. People can work when they're healthy and happy. It has the added benefit of allowing those who typically would not be able to use an automobile to also move around a city: those who cannot drive, the elderly, and children. There is an enormous amount of congestion that comes from parents driving their children to local activities that they should otherwise be able to cycle to, but do not. Ironically, this is because parents (and kids) perceive the roads to be too dangerous with the very vehicular traffic they are contributing to. By effectively disabling this group of citizens - kids, seniors, and those of us who have mobility issues to begin with, we rob them of their own agency and autonomy. That also has a societal cost. What makes cycling dangerous is not the activity but the environment in which it is practiced. Mixing heavy, fast moving vehicles, in which the driver is often cocooned, careless and unaware of their surroundings, with cyclists and pedestrians creates a dangerous condition. This is why we have bicycle lanes in the first place. Furthermore, because cars and trucks are heavy and hard on our public roadways, the road surface is not always safe for cyclists and can cause accidents directly - hit a pothole - or indirectly - dodged a pothole, entered vehicle traffic and were hit by an unaware driver.\nPerhaps the upfront costs of constructing dedicated bicycle lanes are expensive, but their maintenance compared to vehicular roads is not, and their net benefit to society probably exceeds that initial cost several fold. Add to that the benefits of maximizing commerce and human interactions, creating a quieter, healthier environment, which automobiles, at least in dense urban environments, do not do, and it seems utterly foolish to invest more in one and not the other.\nLastly, this is simply stupid legislation produced, in typical fashion, by a stupid government lead by a stupid Premier. They're blaming of bicycle lanes for the state of gridlock in southern Ontario towns and cities demonstrates shallow thinking and a knee-jerk reaction by a lazy incompetent leadership seeking to politicize every issue rather than simply doing what's best for the society they are supposed to be stewards of. There are myriad other factors that contribute more to the increasing congestion experienced in the last two decades than the mere addition of bicycle lanes: astonishing population growth, sub-urban and rural sprawl, inept urban planning, antiquated traffic signaling, slow uptake and poor adaptation of round-abouts that would otherwise keep traffic moving, poor license requirements by vehicle users resulting in the largely abysmal quality of drivers in Ontario, incredible public subsidization of private vehicle use, complete lack of commensurate investment in truly usable public transit and literally ANY other means of moving people around besides an automobile, et cet era. At it simplest, limiting construction of new bicycle lanes - and removing existing successful ones - will only push more people into vehicles and it will cost us all dearly.\nThe solution to too much vehicle congestion in southern Ontario will not be more vehicle congestion.\n"

The evidence that bike lanes save lives and help get cars off the road is overwhelming, as well as the evidence that increasing lanes does not solve gridlock in the long term, and in fact only increases congestion is real and out there. When people on bikes die as a result of no longer having a safe place to cycle on the roads, then I hope everyone who votes for this bill knows that there is blood on their hands and this is a direct result of their actions. It is shameful and not looking out for the best interest of Ontarians, and only furthering an agenda of a few that will be detrimental to the many.\nBe people with a vision who want to create a healthier society in the long term, not short sighted greedy politicians who wish for short term results that will fall to pieces in 5 years costing more money.\n"

        "comment": "I bike regularly to work, and to access services and goods. It is my main form of transportation, year round. I live in Waterloo Region. I can bike everywhere that I need to because the Cities and the Region have made great improvements to making biking safer. They are succeeding at giving its citizens the choice to travel in any way they want. Now it is not just drivers who can get around, but also cyclists, with improved bike lane system, and pedestrians, with the expanded public transit system.  I feel safe in separated bike lanes. Drivers have multiple options to choose, that might add a few seconds to their trips, and they recognize it is a small price to pay to keep cyclist safe. Many changes have happened in the downtown areas. If you ask downtowners, they will tell you that they live downtown because it is easy to walk and bike around, and they would like to keep it that way.  The only ones who complain are people who don't live in the downtown. Dismantling the bike system to appease drivers who are in a hurry to get through the downtown would eliminate a good reason why people choose to live downtown. These drivers are not driving through the downtown to enjoy what it has to offer, and they don't care if the downtown gets ruined to add more room for their cars. People who live downtown, support the downtown, and care about how it feels to walk and bike around.\nI ask that the province pivot in its attitude towards safe biking, and start supporting our municipalities in their effort to make our region inclusive of all travellers, including cyclists and pedestrians.\n"

        "comment": "I'm a lifelong Torontonian who has lived in various parts of the city. I commute almost every day using practically every mode of transportation: walking, biking, driving, and taking the TTC. For several years I would commute by bicycle to school, work, and social functions. I decided to stop cycling regularly several years ago after too many minor accidents and dangerous close calls involving motor vehicles on the road. Despite knowing it was good for the environment, a source of exercise, and an efficient way to get where I was going, I decided the city infrastructure was simply too poor to continue biking regularly and still feel safe.\nThen came the new additions to biking infrastructure across the city over the past several years, in particular the Bloor bike lanes. Protected, consistent infrastructure across large parts of the city created a night and day difference. In the past I never would have considered cycling from my home in the Little Portugal area to visit my brother at Main and Danforth. Suddenly, there was access to the equivalent of a bike highway, where I could safely and quickly ride across the city. It felt like at last Toronto was entering into a new, modern, and more thoughtful era.\nNow, of course, after years of planning, consideration, review, and construction, this provincial government wants to rip it all up in a short-sighted bid to appease a minority of drivers. Congestion is caused by cars! If you want less traffic you need less cars on the road. The answer to that is viable alternatives. No major city in the world has been able to solve its traffic problems by adding more lanes. I believe that removing the bike lanes on Bloor, Yonge, and University would be a shameful use of our resources with no foreseeable long-term benefit. This plan would actively make our city a worse place to live and I am 100% against it.\n"
