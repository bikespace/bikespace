This will mean more cyclists can get to and from their destinations safely without needing to put more cars on the road.\n"

        "comment": "I am a cyclist, pedestrian, driver and transit rider in East Toronto/ Scarborough. I use the Martin Goodman Trail and Carlaw, Cherry, Simcoe and Commissioners bike lanes for almost 6 months a year.  Daily! The scariest part of my journey is riding on Queen East between parked cars and streetcars or speeding SUVs who use my hood as a highway. If we had safer transit options\u2014 Go and TTC, we could use that more often, but the vehicles run rarely, are too crowded and full of people with aggression problems and of course some lines still arent built! Riding my bike can be scary but it is the best of the poisons. Not everyone can afford two cars or parking downtown. Or wants to drive 10km and sit in traffic for 60min. If the premier of Ontario wants to interfere with cities trying to keep cyclists alive, I and all lot of other tax-paying citizens who voted our mayor and councillors in are left wondering why Toronto doesnt get democracy? And lets face it\u2014 this is anti-Toronto.  How about the province gives us the Eglinton and Finch LRT? Like\u2014 working? And more Go trains stopping at Danforth? And more money for TTC and construction speed on Gardiner ramps and lanes? Do you know it can take us 3 hrs to get from East Toronto to Hamilton in the weekend? Thats not bike lanes. Thats one lane open on Lakeshore. 2 on the Gardiner. Subway and Go shutdowns.  Ludicrous.  Do better. And leave cyclists alone!\n"

        "comment": "This Bill is entirely misguided.\n1. Bikes don't cause congestion. Cars do. There is extensive data that backs this up... everything from examples in Montreal to the history of the effectiveness of congestion pricing in Stockholm. Every time I use my bike instead of my car, that's one less car contributing to congestion, and one less person competing for a parking spot. We should be adding more and better cycling infrastructure (and transit)  to help reduce the numbers of cars on the road that are the congestion, not removing existing lanes at great cost, and putting up legislative barriers to make it more difficult for cities to do.\n2. I value the infrastructure and use it multiple times a week to shop for groceries, run errands, go to medical appointments, etc. The things that people on bikes need and want to do are just as important, and contribute as much to the economy, as anyone in a car. And it's just as important that we have the infrastructure available to do it safely.\n3. Removing bike lanes will be incredibly expensive. As a taxpayer, I want to see my taxes build things...Healthcare, transit, addressing homelessness, etc... Not tearing things down.\n4. It is telling that applications for actions taken under this Bill, should it become Law, will be from the Minister's office, not from Staff. Choices around infrastructure, including bike lanes, roads, and transit, should be based on improving the situation for all, not on political considerations like catering to a voting base. This is a transparently political stunt, and the government should be embarrassed to put it forward as a policy.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is at odds with research and data that shows that bike lanes help to decrease traffic by removing cars off the road. There is a low percentage of cyclists on the roads, because most cities do not have safe infrastructure to do so.\nCyclists will continue to use roads even without a bike lane, but this will create more congestion as mixing cars and bikes means cars will be forced to safely pass bikes at slower speeds. More lane changes, more stops, ands more cycling deaths. All of this in favour of something not guaranteed, few minutes of driving. If there is more lanes, more people will drive and there will be congestion. However, if there is more bike lanes, more people will feel safe to bike and there will be less cars on the road.  Why not put energy into adding more bike lanes, buses, and transit to remove more cars on the roads so only those who need to drive, can drive without congestion? I empathize with the wish to increase commute times, but let's increase commute times for all. Not just cars.\nOn a recent trip in the evening, I drove instead of biking and it took me twice as long. The route I drove only partially had bike lanes and prior, it was parked cars. The bike lanes are not to blame, its the fact that most people are driving because the route is incomplete. When I bike, I take up less space on the road, and can get to my destinations quicker. The bike lanes mean I am safe.\nPeople deserve safe options.\n"

        "comment": "I voice my absolute disapproval for this piece of legislation, here are my thoughts and some proposed solutions to our ongoing transportation issues in this province.\n1.\tThe Fundamental Premise of the Bill is Deeply Flawed.\nIn its preamble, the government claims the bill aims to \"fight gridlock and get drivers where they need to go faster.\" This approach is misguided for several reasons. First, the focus should not be solely on speeding up vehicle travel, but rather on ensuring that people can reach their destinations more efficiently. Moreover, if this legislation were rooted in sound transportation principles, it would acknowledge that simply building more highways or adding vehicle lanes does not effectively address traffic congestion.\nThe primary cause of urban congestion in Ontario is the prevalence of low-density, car-centric sprawl. A well-informed policy would recognize this reality and advocate for a regional strategy that embraces multi-modal transportation options to reduce the number of vehicle trips made. At the provincial level, this should involve coordinated inter-regional planning that aligns regional growth with public transit, active transportation, and, when absolutely necessary, limited vehicle access for delivery and utility work. (ie use cars only when absolutely necessary).\nThe idea that expediting highway development through farmland, eliminating bike lanes, and reducing active transportation infrastructure is not only misguided but also a significant misallocation of time and resources. I strongly urge you to reconsider this approach.\n2.\t Micromanaging Local Issues is a Misallocation of Ministerial Resources\nThe idea of the Minister micro-managing local transportation issues, such as bicycle lanes, is not only an inefficient use of time and resources but also undermines the government\u2019s goal of reducing red tape by adding unnecessary layers of infrastructure approvals.\nLocal planning decisions of this nature are best left to municipalities, which have a deeper understanding of their communities' needs. Rather than targeting one of the viable solutions to gridlock\u2014like bicycle lanes\u2014we need the Minister to focus on coordinating growth and transit plans between municipalities. This includes ensuring that active transportation and public transit corridors are integrated into future growth plans and that there is effective infrastructure coordination across municipal boundaries on a macro-scale.\n3.\tWaste of Taxpayers Time and Money\nIt appears that the Premier and Minister have already decided to eliminate several fully constructed cycling infrastructure projects in Toronto, including the lanes on Bloor, University, and Yonge Streets. These projects, which cost taxpayers millions of dollars, are now under threat just as they have been completed. The proposed removals come with an uncertain cost and an unknown timeline for construction.\nWe urge you not to waste our time or subject us to months of gridlock while dismantling vital infrastructure. Let\u2019s prioritize effective solutions that benefit our community instead.\n4.\tPlease focus on safety and effectiveness:\nThis proposal will place bicycles directly in traffic, potentially worsening the very issues it aims to address. Not only does this jeopardize the safety of Ontarians, but it fails to provide a viable solution to the problem at hand. Please focus on actual solutions to fix our transport problems.\nFor example consider the following:\na.\tRemove On-Street Parking in Priority Corridors\nIf right-of-way real estate is a concern, consider implementing growth bonuses and provincial design standards to address a significant inefficiency in our corridors: on-street parking. Removing parking would free up space for two travel lanes, as well as wider, grade-separated bike lanes and improved public realm features that can enhance local real estate values and stimulate commerce.\nb.\tIntegrated Regional Transit Planning:\nDevelop a comprehensive regional transit strategy that connects multiple municipalities, prioritizing the creation of reliable, frequent, and affordable public transit options\u2014such as buses and light rail\u2014that link urban centers with suburban areas. Additionally, allow passengers to bring their bicycles on inter-regional transit to facilitate the first and last few kilometers of their journey. By enhancing transit accessibility, we can reduce dependence on personal vehicles, thereby alleviating congestion and curbing urban sprawl.\nc.\tIncentivize Mixed-Use Development:\nEncourage municipalities to adopt zoning policies that promote mixed-use developments. This approach combines residential, commercial, and recreational spaces within walkable neighborhoods, reducing the need for long commutes and fostering vibrant communities. Incentives, such as tax breaks or grants for developers, can help facilitate these projects and combat urban sprawl.\nd.\tImplement Congestion Pricing:\nIntroduce congestion pricing in heavily trafficked areas to manage demand during peak hours. By charging a fee for driving in certain zones during high-traffic times, we can encourage commuters to use public transit, carpool, or shift their travel times. The revenue generated can be reinvested into transportation infrastructure and public transit enhancements, further improving mobility and reducing congestion.\ne.\tUse What We\u2019ve Got:\nBefore moving forward with plans to construct a billion-dollar highway over the GTA, we must address one of the most significant public infrastructure failures in Ontario\u2019s history: the under-utilization of Highway 407. Instead of promoting widespread sprawl, we should incentivize its use for cargo and commercial vehicles. If we do need to build a new east-west corridor, let\u2019s focus on enhancing inter-regional transit by developing a circulator route for Metrolinx, rather than adding more highways.\n"

        "comment": "I live in Toronto and see for myself, on a daily basis, the various streets and roads in Toronto.  Since the announcement, I have paid alot of attention to traffic and our roadways. Lets use Yonge Street as an example.  The laneways have allowed me to feel safe in using my bicycle, given the utter decline in frequency of Toronto bus and subway service.\nAs I look at heavy traffic, what I am observing it is worst in areas where roads are torn up or under construction.\nAs a taxpayer, I wonder:  What studies have been that measure the impact that bike lanes have supposedly made in adding to gridlock?  How was this decision made.  What was the cost to install these bike lanes that are now apparently coming done?  What will the cost be to remove the bike lanes?\nCall me niave, but when I see the width of the lanes along Yonge Street, there is not enough bike laneway to add another lane for cars?  So how will this help reduce congestion.  With or without bike lanes, we'll still have traffic jams.  Less cars, requires better transit, bike lanes and the courage for politicians to stand up for what best serves our environment at this point into climate change.\nIt makes me so sad to see that these lanes will taken down and for what real purpose.  I fail to understand how this will alleviate congestion.  Instead, drivers will be all the more aggressive for those still brave enough to try and use their bicycle for going along Yonge street or into the downtown core.  We have a city that was not built to accomodate the numbers of people that our gov't is encouraging to come and live in Toronto.  We don't have the roads, the hospitals, the schools, etc.  We can't manage the number of cars already on our streets.\nAs well, we have an economy that has come to rely on uber eats, skip the dishes, etc.  Is it fair to put the lives of these already, unprotected workers at so much risk to satisfy the whims of Doug Ford.\nI think an interesting question would be how many people took to biking, as they were finding the ttc has become so impractical in its slow and infrequent service of these last few years.  What I mean, can't afford a cab/uber/lyft all the time, but with bus wait times of like 30 minutes, sometimes that just isn't frequent enough.  And, now, that gets taken away too---unless you want to risk injury or worse.\nI could not be unhappier with our current Premier.  So many poor decisions that are not made in the intersest of the common good.\n"

        "comment": "This bill will add red tape to municipal projects, slowing them down and increasing their cost. It would also make it more difficult for municipalities to provide transportation options other than driving. Many municipalities are adding density to help alleviate the housing crisis, this bill could prevent a viable alternative to driving being built in these areas. It may also increase the cost of these developments as car parking requires more space than bicycle parking.\nAlternatives to driving must be built to increase accessibility and total throughput in denser areas. Bike lanes can be an excellent alternative, especially for teenagers and young adults who may be too young to drive or unable to afford to drive. People are going to bike places regardless of their infrastructure, it is best we build dedicated and safe spaces for them to cycle. Ontario is growing, we can choose now to build a province that is ready to offer diverse solutions to help us grow or stagnate on a single solution that may set us back.\n"

A city is more than just cars moving from point A to point B; it\u2019s about providing spaces that support people\u2019s quality of life, health, and connection to their surroundings. Removing bike lanes on major streets like Bloor, Yonge, and University in Toronto would set the city back years in terms of progress toward sustainable, accessible transportation options.\nAs more people feel safe and confident on the roads, cycling rates will increase, reducing reliance on cars and, by extension, cutting down on traffic congestion. Encouraging alternatives like one-way traffic patterns or addressing specific choke points are viable ways to tackle congestion without dismantling vital infrastructure that people rely on.\nBike lanes also reduce environmental impact, promote healthier lifestyles, and make urban spaces more attractive and accessible. If we limit cycling infrastructure, we inadvertently push more people toward car ownership, which only compounds traffic issues and pollution. Instead, a city should foster environments where walking, cycling, and public transit are viable and attractive options for everyone. If long-term solutions are needed, investing in forward-thinking solutions like hyperloop technology would make much more sense than dismantling infrastructure that encourages sustainable transportation. Let\u2019s preserve and expand on the progress we\u2019ve made, not reverse it.\n"

The demand however is there \u2014 Bike Share TO ridership continues to expand and grow. Bike infrastructure has also proven to increase the quality of life in public spaces for people of all income levels, children, families, and increase access to businesses on these safer streets (see Montreal's car-free streets that goes beyond just better bike lanes!)

        "comment": "As a resident of Swansea who lives near Bloor St. West, I support the removal of the bike lanes that were recently installed on Bloor St. W, especially from Jane St. to downtown. Specifically, in the area of Bloor West Village (Jane St. to Keele St.), the addition of the two bike lines and the removal of the traffic lanes has brought traffic to a near standstill, with resulting idling cars that are detrimental to air quality. The local businesses are complaining of the difficulties in dealing with garbage, deliveries, and customers who need to come by car. It is unsafe to park and unload an elderly person or young children with strollers, as parked cars are now surrounded either by moving traffic on one side or moving bicycles on the other - you can no longer step onto the sidewalk but must step into the bike lane when exiting a car. I am also concerned about the potential reduction in response times of emergency vehicles, as traffic is usually at a standstill, with no room for cars to pull over. Visually, the road is chaotic and cluttered, with the white spikes lining road. Turning right, as a driver, has now become a dangerous undertaking, as the cyclists coming up on the right often do not stop for lights or cars.\nI am in support of safe lanes for cyclists, but I think the city planners did not think this current plan through. Bike lanes should not be placed on the main arteries of our city, but rather on parallel streets (in Bloor West Village and Swansea, such as Colbeck Ave., for example, or Deforest Rd., to the south). Considering that we live in Toronto, with cold adverse weather for at least 5-6 months of year, it is not reasonable to reserve two lanes on main arteries for bikes. Even in good weather, in Bloor West Village, I will see maybe 1 or 2 bikes go by, if that, while the two remaining lanes of car traffic are clogged. The bike lanes have been installed on Bloor St. to the detriment of drivers, pedestrians, businesses, and those who may need emergency services. I fully support safe options for cyclists, but clear and well-thought-out planning needs to devise alternate safe paths for bikes that do not include the main artery of our city. As an addendum, my husband is an avid cyclist, and he also sees the bike lanes on Bloor St. as misguided.\n"
