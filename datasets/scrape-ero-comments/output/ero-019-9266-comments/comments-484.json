        "comment": "I am writing this letter to implore you and your government not to destroy the bike lanes along Bloor and Yonge Sts. and University Ave. in Toronto.\nI am a resident of Toronto, and a regular user of bike lanes, frequent car driver, and public transit user.  I drive, cycle and take transit along these throughways in the city of Toronto.\nThe bike lanes that have been installed in these areas have been some of the transformative additions to the streetscape on each of these streets in decades.  They have made the roads safer for cyclists, car drivers and pedestrians.  They have become vital arteries for cyclists in the city, and streets that I depend upon to safely and quickly get to and from my job.\nIt is no secret that removing these bike lanes will not speed up traffic in the city.  This was clearly acknowledged by staff of your government in a memo that leaked to the public.  Instead, there is ample evidence from around the world that bike lanes increase safety for all road users, including cyclists, pedestrians and car drivers.\nRemoving these bike lanes will be extremely regressive, harmful to my community, and would reduce freedom of mobility in my city.  The Bloor Annex BIA has already communicated to your government that removal of these lanes would be \"disastrous\" to their businesses.\nIf these lanes are removed, the Ford Government will be known from here on out as Anti-Safety, Anti-Freedom, and Anti-Business.  Removing these lanes is a significant government overreach, and a threat to my safety and my freedom of movement.  I implore your government to not move forward with this plan.\nPlease protect the safety, freedom, and business success of my communities, and keep these bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nPlease give up this bill. It is a terrible idea today and a terrible idea for the future of our cities and their inhabitants.\nBike lanes are not an issue, they are part of the solution to fight traffic jams, air pollution and noise pollution. They are the perfect complementary solution to public transportation as bike racks do not take a lot of space and a bike allows the user to access areas that public transportation does not cover. I think they are also great to make Toronto's neighborhoods more lively, more small-businesses friendly and more human.\nIf there are traffic jams it is because there are too many cars on the roads and not enough alternatives, not the other way around. Also a lot of streets and lanes are closed due to road works and constructions, so this creates punctual issues.\nTiming is not ideal, with all the constructions going on, in the streets and also TTC maintenance and construction works.\nDestroying all the progress that has been done to offer people alternatives in the recent years is certainly not the solution to traffic jams.\nMost people do not use bikes just for fun, it is first and foremost a more practical and quicker way of moving in a big city like Toronto than any other means of transportation.\nPlus, the available literature actually shows evidence that creating more road lanes makes things worse in terms of traffic. It follows the famous law of supply and demand. The more road lanes one opens, the more people will think \"hey let's use the car now, they have added a road lane so it should be a quicker drive\"...\nAnother issue with your bill is people's safety... Not having bike lanes makes roads more dangerous for everyone. No one wants a biker at the hospital or dead, and no one wants a pedestrian injured because a biker was using a sidewalk to be safe when riding his or her bike.\nEvery time I ride my bike in Toronto on roads that have no bike lanes I feel unsafe, even though I have decades of experience and even though I used to practice mountain biking in a club.\nEven with experience, protective equipment, lights etc... a biker is vulnerable in front of a car or a truck.\nInstead of paving the way for more and more cars, why don't we all work on effective alternatives.\nJust like pedestrians, cars and (some) LRTs have their own \"lanes\", bikes should have dedicated lanes too.\nEven from a financial perspective it makes more sense. It is a cheaper, more affordable solution that can/could be better combined with public transportation to go from point A to point B.\nAnd instead one single road lane you can have 2 to 4 bike lanes or a bike lane and a parking spot or a bike lane and restaurants' terraces. This makes a neighborhood more economically powerful.\nLet's stop living in the past when everything was built around cars and for car users. The more roads you build the more cars will be on the roads, and the more traffic jams will block the streets and roads making our cities a terrible place to live in.\nBikes and bikes lanes are not the issue, they are part of the solution.\nSure, there is a need for better city planning to make Toronto more attractive and more habitable  for everyone. No doubt about it! There is a booming population, this probably requires a denser housing combined with an improved public transports system to move millions of people effectively.\nPlease, I beg you, do not make things worse and more dangerous by adding road lanes and removing bike lanes...\n"

Streets like University, Bloor/Danforth, Yonge and many others across the city have been vastly improved by safe bike lane infrastructure. It saves lives.\nThe downtown core is full of cars because there are so many people driving cars into the downtown core. Fewer cars = less car traffic. It's a pretty basic concept.\nBill 212 represents an unnecessary encroachment into municipal governance and would be a massive waste of money. Torontonians voted for the councillors who made those bike lanes happen. Without citing any evidence or research that would back up your claims, you're seeking to override the will of the very people whose lives will be imperiled by this backwards proposal.\nI urge you to reconsider. If you honestly want to tackle congestion, look for ways to reduce car traffic. You should be encouraging MORE cycling, MORE transit, MORE walkable neighbourhoods.\n"

The most dangerous portion of my drive is when the bike infrastructure is not available and I have to ride in line with rush hour commuters. I cannot even believe I have to send in a note advocating to not remove existing lanes. There should be 10x the amount of lanes, yet this government is proposing removing them. I bike by gridlocked traffic every morning where the majority of cars are operated by single drivers. I would be one more car on the road and one more piece of the congestion\n if I wasn\u2019t on my bike. If 1/3 of those people were on bikes there would be 1/3 less traffic!! Removing cycling infrastructure adds to car traffic, puts cyclists in danger and promotes car centric living which discourages people from using bibles which are good for exercise and the environment.\n"

        "comment": "Just Put Bike Lanes on Side Streets?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGJBTtzsoII\nPutting bike lanes on local streets has no effect on traffic as cyclists still have to get destinations on the main streets, but adds unnecessary travel time for cyclists. Forcing cyclists to travel only on side streets is an impractical solution due to Toronto's historical imperfect grid street design. Main artilleries are usually straight, while side street routes are most often convoluted. And due to the secondary nature of side streets, they are also less visible and harder to seek, one could easily get lost. 20 km of uninterrupted separated bike lanes on Bloor is a game changer for many commuters, drivers or cyclists alike, there are no other routes on the side streets as direct as Bloor.\nAre Bike Lanes Making Traffic Worse? | The Agenda\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4X_NXVFLq4\nThe prevalence of automotive vehicles hinges on the interconnectivity of car infrastructure; the growth of bicycles as a transportation option is also dependent on uninterrupted, protected, separated bike lanes. Basing infrastructure planning on current usage is shortsighted and unaccommodating of the needs of people. The number of daily riders has grown 5x in the past 10 years. Riding bicycles enhances affordability, wellbeing, and economic activity. Around the world, commercial activity escalated after cars were removed. It is obligatory for society to protect the interests of people who desire to ride bicycles. It is also beneficial to build bike lanes, as the bicycle that's beside you is the car that isn't.\nCanada\u2019s traffic is brutal. Does it have to be? | Front Burner\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-IZ2LDWbk\nThe root cause of traffic congestion is too many cars. Based on the principles of induced demand, traffic volume is increased by improvements to car infrastructure. If cities take away alternative safe transportation options, cars would become the only transportation they'd use.\nThere's no data that shows bike lanes cause congestion. On the contrary, implementing cycling as part of multi-transportation networks where a variety of transportation options are provided to citizens eases congestion.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are key to our city's commerce, livability, and environmental impact. The city, as well as city services such as the Fire Dept, have presented the fact that there is not a slowdown based on having these bike lanes. As someone who drives in the city of Toronto daily, the greatest causes of traffic and slowdown are: excessive construction that has been poorly planned/scheduled, and reckless and thoughtless drivers who \"block the box\" and run through red lights. I am very excited for the Ontario Line, but the required construction has reduced lanes many key Toronto East thoroughfares, as have other necessary infrastructure projects. Additionally, condo developments around town have reduced lanes in key downtown corridors, as have necessary TTC infrastructure upgrades. Not to mention the infuriatingly overdue Eglinton LRT and its impact. Years of unfettered condo development without the necessary transit infrastructure to support it has also played a major role.\nTo me this reeks of Premier Ford continuing the \"war on cars\" as fought by he and his brother in city hall so many years ago. Also, a valid question - the amount of tax dollars that were spent to install these bike lanes will be wasted as millions more go into tearing them up, and just who, pray tell will be getting the contracts for this work? My tax dollars are betting it will be more of Premier Ford's friends and donors, just like his land developer buddies who will reap the benefits of the 413 paving the green belt, and the relocation of the Science Centre to downtown, where it will cause additional traffic congestion.\n"

I always look for a route along a bike lane because I feel much safer than riding side by side with the cars on busy streets. I fear if the bike lanes on Bloor Street, Yonge Street and University Avenue are removed, the number of cyclist deaths will increase dramatically. It will likely mean I will choose my bicycle less often for my trips around the city. I doubt it will deter the number of bicycle couriers on our streets, so their lives will be put in danger. There are many studies that show the positive benefits of bike lanes. I think the government needs to show the public some studies that show that tearing out bike lanes improves traffic congestion and doesn\u2019t lead to more deaths of cyclists. A responsible government wouldn\u2019t arbitrarily introduce a bill like this without reputable proof that what they propose will alleviate congestion.

Incentivizing non-automobile traffic is the only feasible way to reduce gridlock in an increasingly dense area. More lanes for cars has never worked to reduce gridlock, and removing safe lanes for people choosing alternatives to cars and buses will do the opposite.\nStart making some actual policy that helps people instead of meddling in municipal affairs, and costing cities and taxpayers more money to deliver worse solutions.\n"

This also greatly oversteps the provincial governments role by interfering with municipalities ability to control their own activities. How does it make any sense to waste Ontario taxpayer money, to undo something built with municipal tax dollars, and that is popular in the cities where it was implemented.\nThis at a time, when the whole world should be supporting sustainable transportation (Toronto does not need more single-occupancy vehicles) to fight climate change. Not to mention that it is actively against the will of the people it claims to support (see supporting link), and against all fact-based evidence to the contrary.\nThe entire enterprise is frankly absurd, and is another fantastic example of the Ford government's blatant corruption and pandering to their base instead of governing for ALL of the people of Ontario. I pray that the people of Ontario come to their senses and vote out this government before we regress any further.\n"
