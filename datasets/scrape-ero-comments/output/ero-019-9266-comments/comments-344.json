I urge you to rethink this bill and not remove the bicycle lanes on Bloor Street.\n"

Instead, the provincial government should be focusing on alternative means of travel that aren't cars to remedy traffic within the city.\n1) Bike lane management should not be under the jurisdiction of provincial government. It is a municipal responsibility to manage these lanes.\n2) Bike lane removals should not be the targets for clearing up traffic within the city. Instead, there needs to be alternative options to driving into/through the city. Public transit (which can be handled by provincial government) should be the highest priority given that Ontario is laughably behind other developed regions across the world in terms of access to public transit.\n"

Traffic congestion is due to lack of investment/delays in developing transit, increased population, and construction.  Removing these bike lanes will not help your commute on the 401.\n3.  This is not safe for bike riders, car drivers, or pedestrians.  There are no direct routes that substitute for these three streets. Bikes will be forced to ride in the same lanes as cars or on the sidewalk.\n4.  Removing the bike lanes will be costly for our city and create more construction chaos.\nVisit other cities that have pedestrian malls, bike lanes, restricted access for cars, and efficient TRANSIT and you will see how it can work to improve all our lives and reduce carbon.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes is a gigantic waste of time and money. The Ontario government is stuck in the 1960s, thinking that cars are the only way to get around Toronto. They should be investing in better public transportation and MORE bike lanes to encourage people to ditch their cars and use other methods of transportation to get around Toronto. That\u2019s how we\u2019ll reduce gridlock in this city.\nAdditionally, separated bike lanes have been shown to keep cyclists safe on our roads when getting around the safety. They have encouraged so many people in Toronto to ride their bikes instead of driving.\nI also would like to know why the provincial government is sticking their noses into municipal matters? They\u2019re overstepping their boundaries and should leave bike lanes in the City of Toronto\u2019s jurisdiction. This seems like a violation of the Strong Mayor powers.\n"

Ripping up built infrastructure to give more room for cars, while not meaningfully improving traffic is asinine. I have driven on Bloor, Yonge, and University consistently since the bike lanes have been complete and they are better roads for them. Having properly designed roads with bike lanes, turning lanes, bus bays and loading zone as necessary is far better than simple adding an extra lane and turning the road into a free for all. That is how you get people killed. It is also worth noting, the reason traffic is bad on University is not, nor ever was, a lack of lanes. It is the bloody Gardiner. THAT backed up traffic on University.\nDon't be stupid, look at the data, look at the evidence and do the right thing. Bike lanes save lives and increase the capacity of a road with a minimal effect on car traffic.\n"

        "comment": "I am a resident of Toronto and am deeply concerned with the lack of foresight and basic critical thinking skills used by this government in their approach to bike lanes, among other issues. Countless reports and research papers prove that bike lanes are more effective at reducing congestion than car lanes, which simply promote induced demand. The overreach of the provincial government in what is clearly a municipal issue is also concerning. The Ontario government needs to focus on supporting the will of the city and its citizens, not bulldozing years of progress at a whim. Bike lane usage has increased substantially year-over-year and will continue to do so as more lanes are added to the network. This is what will reduce congestion for Toronto, not destroying the existing network. It is a guarantee that removing these bike lanes will increase congestion and road deaths for cyclists and pedestrians in Toronto.\nThe cost along of undoing years of good work by the city will hurt taxpayers more by wasting millions of dollars that could be used better. Some ideas that are proven to help with congestion, as you clearly have run out, include affordable rental housing around existing train stations, finishing transit projects such as the Eglinton Crosstown, and starting new transit projects to reach commuter regions.\nIt is absolutely disappointing to see how incompetent Doug Ford and his government have proven to be. Do us all a favour and focus on the rest of the province, and leave Toronto out of your ridiculous proposals. You've done enough.\n"

It's frankly embarrassing the way this government refuses to focus on real issues and instead steps over dollars to pick up dimes.\nThe province should invest properly in public transit. Who knows, perhaps if they did that they might see a project to completion for a change. We don't need more highways, we need more viable options for transit that don't have us sitting in gridlock, that can move large numbers of people efficiently and is affordable.\nOther countries have solved it, maybe we could ask the experts in the field rather than pandering to NIMBYs.\nFrom a concerned citizen who is tired of the wasteful spending.\n"

Build a bike lane system that you would feel safe sending your own kids on, then do the same for our public transit.\n"

If anything, we should be legislating more bike lanes, better public transit, and high speed trains across the province.\nWe can reduce traffic by reducing the number of cars on the road. Vehicles are causing the traffic which means we need to focus on ways to remove the number of vehicles from the road.\n"

A logical solution would be to require municipalities to add increased attention to traffic impacts to their design and consultation processes.\nSimply removing already constructed public infrastructure without any kind of due process or evidence-based decision making, is an absurd waste of taxpayer funds. Furthermore, adding a provinical review process for municipal construction is adding an extra layer of bureaucratic waste and delay to an already slow process of building infrastructure.\nThis government claims to value reducing government waste, and has even created an entire new ministry to do so. And yet, here you are creating an entirely superfluous level of bureaucratic review that will do nothing to improve the traffic conditions of our roads.\n"

We wonder why Doug Ford wants to pollute the city further instead of fostering and supporting more bike lanes for cleaner air. Downtown gridlock is caused by all the construction going on, not by bike lanes.\nThis smells like an election \u2018move\u2019 to garner votes from \u2018drivers of cars\u2019. It also feels like a \u2018dictator\u2019 move by overriding the power of City of Toronto councillors.\nAlso, very suspicious: The $200 for every Ontarian. Buying votes, anyone? And what is with providing beer and liquor in corner and grocery stores? It feels like promoting alcoholism. Just like keeping the liquor stores, and the big box stores, open during the Covid lockdowns, and closing small businesses, many of whom went out of business.

As congestion has worsened and the city population has grown exponentially, many people use the bike lanes daily. There is a vast array of sources that attest to the positive impact on congestion created by bike lanes. The lanes have not effected emergency response times. They have saved lives.\nBy this proposed legislation, it is clear that The provincial government clearly only cares about securing votes from people for low hanging fruit and not actually improving congestion or other quality of life issues.\n"

        "comment": "The requirement for Ministry approval for bicycle lanes, especially in cases where motor vehicle lanes are affected, could limit municipalities\u2019 ability to respond promptly to local transportation needs. Municipalities have the closest understanding of their unique infrastructure challenges and community priorities. This legislation might introduce unnecessary bureaucratic delays and may not account for the benefits municipalities see in bike lanes, including congestion relief and promoting sustainable transport. Providing municipalities with greater autonomy to make these decisions within provincial safety guidelines would streamline the process and respect local expertise.\nTo enhance this proposal, consider allowing municipalities more decision-making authority within a framework of provincial safety standards. This would minimize delays, respect local expertise, and encourage prompt implementation of beneficial cycling infrastructure. Given the potential impacts on municipal autonomy and efficiency, the proposal should be re-evaluated in greater detail before advancing as legislation.\n"
