It is just NOT a priority nor a need.\nIt is so obvious that this city has an INTENSE need for housing, healthcare AND PROTECTION OF THE GLOBAL CLIMATE.  Why this focus on cars and beer at this time?\nPlease put this money where it is needed.\n"

        "comment": "I believe this legislation is not well thought through and is actually a step backwards.  We need to encourage increased use of cycling, not make it more difficult and dangerous. And it defies belief that these changes will accomplish any noticeable reduction in gridlock. Spend the money on something useful, like improving access to emergency wards in hospitals. Not in ripping out bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to ask that the provincial government to cease its pursuit of this ill considered legislation.\nI am a resident of Toronto. Bike lanes are very important to me. They allow my family, including four children, to transit the city in a far safer manner than the alternatives: my kids riding on the sidewalk (endangering pedestrians) or my kids riding on the street (endangering their lives). Saying \"take the side streets\" is not all that helpful of a comment, as a certain minister has said, as most side streets have to traverse major streets after a very short period of time. So now my, again, four children are expected to cross four-lanes of traffic off from a stop sign.\nParticularly frustrating about this proposed legislation is it trampling on power of local governments. Bike-lanes, or the lack of them, is such a local issue that it is unfathomable how the provincial government thinks it could do a better job at representing constituents in such an area.\nSo much for small government that the conservatives say they always champion. This quite literally adds red-tape and delays to city projects that incorporate a bike lane.\n"

Cars and traffic are loud and dangerous, not to mention the obvious environmental impacts.\nAt the end of the day, if a municipality wants more bike lanes, why is that Doug Ford's business?

        "comment": "While the provincial government continues its support and promotion of car culture, the rest of live in fear our grandchildren won't be able to leave their air conditioned homes. More time and money should be spent on a usable commuter rail system, not highways. More time and money should be spent on constructing more bike lanes with a municipally-funded bike-rental system. Transit should be free. There should be a toll to enter the city of Toronto if you don't live in the city.\nStop this car-mad culture madness, once and for all. Also, if it take you 4 minutes longer to get from point A to point B and you're blaming the bike lanes and not all of the above (lack of transit options, bike options, commuter options) then you're off your crock.\n"

        "comment": "The proposed legislation to remove bike lanes in cities is misguided and potentially dangerous.  I live just north of Bloor Street West near Ossington Avenue.  I use the bike lane along Bloor Street to travel west to the Dufferin Mall and east to Spadina.  Numerous other cyclists - old, young and in between - use the lanes as well. I will provide one example from about a week ago.  A woman and her young daughter, both on their bikes, were cycling west along Bloor Street after school. I immediately wondered what will happen to them once the bike lane is removed. Will they have to ride in traffic, dodging cars and trucks? Will they have to ride on the sidewalk, potentially endangering pedestrians? What are they to do? Will they be injured or even killed?\nOne solution that anti-bike lane proponents have proposed is for cyclists to use parallel side streets.  As a long-time resident in this area, I can assure you there are no parallel side streets that run east and west.  Should we use Dupont? Should we use College?\nFinally, the argument is made that very few people cycle.  That may be true in northern or rural Ontario.  I can assure you that in downtown Toronto many cycle regularly.  Please see the article here about how those arguing against bike lanes are taking statistics they like out of context:  https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/doug-ford-wants-to-rip-up-bike-lanes-b\u2026\nHowever, everyone should remember, it is not all about statistics.  It is about cyclists' safety. It is about climate change. It is about reducing pollution from gas and diesel powered vehicles. Bike lanes save lives in many ways.\n"

        "comment": "Reducing gridlock is a good goal. More lanes for cars to drive along would help in the short term. However, more lanes is not a long term solution. Take the Katy Freeway Expansion in Houston, Texas (2008\u20132011):\nBackground: The Katy Freeway was expanded to as many as 26 lanes in some sections, making it one of the widest freeways in the world.\nOutcome: Despite the expansion, travel times during peak hours increased by 30% in the morning and 55% in the evening within just a few years.\nExplanation: The phenomenon of induced demand occurred\u2014additional road capacity encouraged more people to drive, leading to even more congestion.\nConversely, there are many examples (such as Paris, London, and Copenhagen) where incentivizing non-car transportation has lead to sustained reductions in traffic congestion. Safe bike lanes is a key part of that journey. Yes, there can be short term pain as our society transition to using cars less. We're used to driving everywhere in North America. But we need to encourage folks to use public transportation, bike lanes, or simply walk that 30 minute commute instead of making it easier for everyone to commute 1 person per car to work. It'll only get worse as our cities grow!\nLet the people of each city decide through elected representatives if they should invest in, or divest from bike lanes. Provincial politics should not get involved.\n- A concerned citizen about government overreach\n"

        "comment": "I am absolutely astonished by the lack of research, planning and thought underpinning Bill 212. The Province wants to remove bike lanes in Toronto and reserve the right to veto proposed lanes where they impinge on road lanes. The retrograde nature of the bill has made international headlines and made Toronto a global embarrassment where we could be leading the way.\nIf the Province had explored the evidence for urban bike lanes it would have found that they improve congestion, save lives, reduce emissions and save money through improved health. All of these benefits and co-benefits are publicly available in countless peer-reviewed journal articles, some of which have been referred to by numerous newspaper reports across the country. Failing that, the Province could have evaluated the experience of dozens of other cities in Canada and around the world that have implemented vast networks of bike lanes.\nAs a taxpayer, I am disgusted by the waste that Bill 212 represents. Where is the evidence for Bill 212? Share it with the public if the evidence is available. I urge the Province consider its responsibilities to its constituents and present the evidence or repeal this uninformed, overreaching, wasteful bill.\n"

        "comment": "I have lived, worked and paid taxes in Ontario for over forty years.  I both ride a bike and drive a car, and I know that this proposal is completely wrong.  The only way to solve automobile congestion is by reducing the number of cars, not by making it easier for more and more of them to plug up ever bigger, more expensive and destructive roads, which just perpetuates a destructive vicious cycle.  The way to actually break this cycle is by encouraging cleaner and healthier alternatives such as biking, walking, and public transportation.  I have also lived in several cities in Europe and the States, and have seen firsthand just how pleasant, healthy, and, importantly, efficient those cities with good alternative forms of transportation are.\nThank you\n"

        "comment": "This bill will only create more congestion, put the lives of all road users at even greater risk (doubly so for vulnerable road users on bikes or walking), increase emissions, and is a gross overreach. Safe cycling networks are the backbone of modern great cities, and we see more and more connected infrastructure for cycling being installed in the best world-class cities. This bill is a giant step backward and will even further reduce Ontario cities ability to compete on the world stage. People want safe streets and options other than driving, yet all this bill will do is increase driving and car use, reduce business activity on key destination streets, and make new infrastructure even harder to build.\nThis bill is bad for business, bad for our cities, and especially bad for our people.\n"

The bike lane users who take their cars off the road when using their bikes will no longer feel safe biking without these lanes.\nThose users will simply drive, thus adding more cars to the road and increasing traffic. All that to say, terrible policy. What a waste of money.\n"

Eliminating bike lanes will make roads exponentially more dangerous for both cyclists and drivers. It will contribute to more collisions and fatalities, making streets more congested. It is in direct opposition to decades of research around eliminating traffic. This bill will cost lives.\n"
