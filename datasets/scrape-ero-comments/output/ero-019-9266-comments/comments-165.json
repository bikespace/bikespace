        "comment": "I strongly believe that this bill should not be put into effect. I am against the provincial government having dominion over municipal decisions such as constructing new bike lanes if car lanes need to be reduced.\nLoads of data exist that supports bike lanes actually reducing traffic congestion on municipal roads,   contradictory to what this new bill implies. In comparison, building new car lanes, actually increases congestion over the years as more people take to the road as opposed to other means of transportation. We find ourselves running in the same circles by increasing car lanes instead of building the infrastructure that actually makes a difference for congestion. Give people more options of travel, and less people (especially single passenger vehicles) will take to the roads.\nWe already see the demand for the infrastructure in Toronto alone:\n\"Bike Share Toronto statistics show that ridership on its network of shared bikes has increased dramatically since 2015, when 665,000 bike trips were made annually. In 2023, that shot up to 5.7 million trips.\"\n- https://www.cbc.ca/news/science/bike-lanes-impacts-1.7358319\nWe need to give these cyclists a safe way to travel around their city and not expect them to remain on the roads with drivers. There have been countless incidents where drivers have shown aggression or even violence towards cyclists on the road. Further, cyclists are also not allowed to take to sidewalks because it is dangerous for pedestrians. So, with such an increase of cyclists in our cities these days, where exactly are they expected to ride if the infrastructure gets taken away or new lanes may never get approved?\nWe have a difficult enough time in my city approving new routes and stops for our buses and I fear that giving the province governance over new bike infrastructure will only slow the process of making transportation less congested and smoother for everyone. Too many people take to driving as their main form of transportation because there is an overwhelming scarcity of other options available. If we build the bike lanes, people will use them. And with each new rider who can safely and efficiently travel in a bike lane, we remove one car from our ever increasingly congested roads.\nFor some personal feelings on this bill: I do not feel safe biking in my city.\nI live in London Ontario and will avoid most roads where there is little to no biking infrastructure. However, this is unavoidable at times causing me to either risk my life riding on the road or take to the sidewalk because riding in rush hour traffic is too dangerous. If my city was able to develop the proper biking infrastructure (without first seeking provincial approval) I would bike everywhere I needed to go in London and I can confirm that is at least one less car on the road.\nI fear this is the first step towards the end of new bike lane projects in the province entirely thus halting any attempt to reduce congestion on our roads. People need options for travel. Driving is not the only means of travel that people should desire/be expected to take.\nPlease leave these decisions up to the municipality that it actually affects.\n"

        "comment": "While I will agree that reducing gridlock is an admirable goal, I am remained unconvinced that the measures proposed here would be effective and that the cost, fiscally and environmentally, would be greater than its return.\nConcerning the push to build the 413, it is worthwhile examining the traffic situation in Los Angeles, where building more highways has only encouraged greater use of personal vehicles and resulted in greater congestion and gridlock. Comparatively, cities like Amsterdam or Washington D.C. that have developed reliable, affordable, and fast public transit systems, whether subways, light rail, or bus systems, have seen increased use of those systems and less personal vehicle traffic on their roadways. I also am very concerned about the proposal to exempt 413 lands from environmental assessment. These lands currently act as a natural floodplain and flood control measure, as well as being a carbon sink and an important habitat for native plants and animals. As we've seen this past year, flooding in the greater Toronto area is a growing concern, and developing these lands could have long term implications on this front. Seventy years ago devastating flooding from Hurricane Hazel washed away entire neighbourhoods that been built in floodplains and water shed areas. This catastrophic event led to major reforms in how and where development happened in Toronto, including the creation of greenbelts, and better protections for watersheds and riverways. Removing or even bypassing systems that were put in place to prevent another such event seems shortsighted and potentially dangerous.\nI also have difficulty understanding why bike lanes are such a major traffic issue in Ontario that the province should need to micromanage municipalities over the installation of these bike lanes. How much actual benefit is there in taking this responsibility away from a group (the municipality) that holds close interest in creating a community that is thriving on multiple levels and that is keenly aware that community's unique challenges and needs be? And giving that responsibility to persons who are not intimately connected with that community will lead either to a one-size-fits-all approach or to unnecessary costs and delays in development simply due to unfamiliarity with the needs of that particular community. It's also worthwhile taking into account the many well proven benefits of having communities that are designed to be walkable and/or bikeable. Not only does it encourage healthier lifestyles (reducing load on our healthcare system), but it also removes cars from our congested roads.\nIn short, based on these particular concerns, I am strongly opposed to Bill 212 and I urge our provincial government to reconsider these proposals.\n"

        "comment": "Greetings,\nI am writing to express my vehement opposition to Home Bill 212, the Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024. This bill, which proposes the removal of bike lanes, is an ill-conceived step backwards and counterproductive to the future of sustainable urban development in Ontario.\nKey Points of Opposition:\nUndermining Public Safety:\nRemoving bike lanes will put cyclists directly in harm\u2019s way, forcing them to share congested lanes with cars, trucks, and buses. Protected bike lanes have been shown to significantly reduce the number of cyclist injuries and fatalities by providing a safe space for cyclists away from vehicular traffic. Dismantling these lanes will undoubtedly increase the risk of accidents and deaths on our roads.\nContradicts Climate Goals:\nOntario, like the rest of Canada, has committed to reducing its carbon footprint and encouraging environmentally friendly transportation options. Tearing up bike lanes is a direct assault on these goals. Cycling is one of the most effective ways to reduce car dependency, lower carbon emissions, and promote healthier lifestyles. This bill goes against the spirit of climate action and will only lead to increased car use, congestion, and pollution.\nPromotes Short-Term Thinking:\nBike lanes are an investment in the long-term future of our cities. While removing lanes may appear to \u201creduce gridlock\u201d in the short term, it ignores the proven benefits of encouraging cycling as a viable alternative to driving. Cities around the world that have invested in cycling infrastructure\u2014such as Copenhagen, Amsterdam, and even New York\u2014have seen reductions in traffic congestion and improvements in overall transportation efficiency. Ontario must think ahead, not backwards.\nDisregards Economic and Health Benefits:\nBike lanes are not just a \u201cnice-to-have\u201d\u2014they are crucial for economic vitality and public health. Studies show that cities with strong cycling infrastructure see an uptick in local commerce as cyclists tend to spend more locally compared to drivers. Additionally, cycling promotes public health, reducing the strain on our healthcare system due to conditions related to inactivity.\nA Regressive, Anti-Urban Move:\nThis bill will have the greatest impact on urban areas like Hamilton and Toronto, where bike lanes are critical for providing transportation options to a wide range of residents, including lower-income individuals who rely on cycling as an affordable mode of transport. Removing bike lanes would disproportionately harm these communities while benefiting only car users, many of whom have other transit options available.\nI strongly urge the government to reconsider the damaging implications of Home Bill 212. Instead of ripping up bike lanes, we should be expanding cycling infrastructure and integrating it better with public transportation. Ontario\u2019s future should be focused on building sustainable, safe, and accessible cities for everyone\u2014not turning back the clock.\nThank you for considering my comments.\n"

        "comment": "It is outrageous that the government feels they are above adhering to environmental protections when pollution and climate change are still serious issues that will have a deleterious effect on humanity. Does the Conservative party not care about the health and beauty of Ontario?\nAdditionally, removing bike lanes and inhibiting their installation is not only a waste of money, but ignorant of prevailing knowledge and studies showing that bike lanes improve traffic flow. Considering the vehicles taking up the most space are single occupancy cars, encouraging the use of bicycles and other compact low/zero emission just makes good sense.\n"

Downtown Toronto is already congested enough with cars. Can the environmental registry focus their energy instead on improving public transport across the province and REDUCING the amount of cars? The downtown area would be so much more efficient if was safe and accessible for pedestrians and transit users.  Thanks.\n"

It will do nothing to improve traffic --- in fact, removing bicycle lanes will do quite the opposite.  The solution to traffic is less automobiles, which will only happen if we provide viable transit alternatives (not take them away!).  The last thing we need is another highway (413), and I feel this who bill is a guise so that it can built without environmental assessments.  I vehemently oppose this bill.\n"

No one understands the needs of a city like the mayor and its citizens.

        "comment": "The stated, abstract objective of this Act is to reduce \u201cgridlock,\u201d using means which are proven to be detrimental to public health and safety, mobility and access to Ontario communities for all people, environmental protection, and will aid in worsening the ongoing climate emergency.\nDespite having the authority to do so per the Municipal Act, requiring provincial approval for construction of new bike lanes where they \u201creplace a lane of traffic\u201d is a dramatic overreach of government authority in the affairs of municipalities. This is meddlesome and suggests the provincial government doesn\u2019t have faith or trust in municipalities to manage their own affairs, and further suggests that the provincial government isn\u2019t interested in local democracy\u2014bike lanes aren\u2019t constructed without warning; they are built only after an extensive planning process, which includes considerable research and community input.\nFurthermore, it is an objective fact that more car lanes will not reduce traffic congestion: the concept of Induced Demand indicates that with more car lanes, there is more traffic. This phenomenon has been observed all over the world. If this government were serious about \u201creducing gridlock,\u201d it would be making investments to the tune of several billion dollars to prioritize development and construction of extensive transit projects all over the province, and would invest considerable time, money and effort into the construction of more, comprehensive cycling networks. One more bike on the road is one less car; bikes take up far less space on the road than a single occupancy vehicle, thereby making more room for those who are or who must drive.\nIt is important to mention as well that the three bike lanes Premier Ford has pledged to remove in Toronto also see thousands of users per day\u2014that\u2019s literally thousands of cars that are off the road as a result. Local businesses are more successful in areas with bike lanes (this is easily proven looking at the Bloor Bike Lane reports prepared by City staff in Toronto), and various Toronto BIAs have already come out in support of bike lanes and the detrimental impact their removal would have on local businesses.\nCycling is also the far healthier option: physical activity leads to better health outcomes which leads to less money required for healthcare services.\nInstallation of bike lanes also have the added advantage of making the entire streetscape safer to use for all mobility modes; cars, bikes, pedestrians, and all others. Their existence can save the lives of cyclists and many others. Six cyclists have died on Toronto streets this year, and that is six too many; innocent lives lost because the victims were trying to get across town. Utterly senseless, with families shattered as a result.\nPertaining to bike lanes, my final comment is that the existence of these lanes gives all people greater access to their municipality. Those without the financial means to own a car, pay for insurance, parking, gas, etc. are more able to traverse their municipality for work, recreation, and to support the local economy. A car-centric community is a community that closes itself off to a considerable portion of its population.\nOn the topic of exempting 413 lands from environmental assessments, this is yet another short-sighted policy that will result in disastrous outcomes for the environment. The area where the highway is intended to be built is environmentally sensitive land. Once paved over, that land is lost as a carbon sink, a natural habitat for native flora and fauna, and as a floodplain/natural flood control measure\u2014forever. The proposal that this highway should be exempted from any environmental assessment to expedite development suggests the government doesn\u2019t care whatsoever about the environment and, again, is not serious about eliminating gridlock: as mentioned above, the concept of induced demand means that on completion, it will create more gridlock and spew more harmful greenhouses gas emissions into the atmosphere. Here, again, I must emphasize that if the government is serious about reducing gridlock, the only way forward is to invest in and build a massive public transit infrastructure, and augment municipal streets with alternative means of mobility, such as bike lanes.\nI question whether any planners, environmentalists, engineers or any other credentialed experts were consulted at all in the creation of this bill.\nIn summary, Bill 212 is a backwards approach to \u201creducing\u201d gridlock which will have the complete opposite effect of its stated objective: gridlock will become worse, public safety will be worse, local economies will suffer, the environment will be senselessly, irreparably destroyed, and health outcomes for Ontarians will be worse, which will end up costing us more. This bill should not move forward.\n"

This comment is to share my thoughts on the section of the Act that provides an exemption from the Environmental Assessment Act for enterprises, activities, proposals, plans and programs for or related to Highway 413, including the Highway 413 Project and the Highway 413 early works projects.\nEnvironmental assessments are not red tape, they are measures to protect sensitive and important wildlife. We are in a climate crisis, adding more highways is not the solution. Supporting work-from-home, improving bike lanes, improving public transit - these are measures that help Ontarians get to work safely and in an environmental conscious way.  The more cars we get off the roads, the better - not the other way around.\nIf this provincial government is so set on a highway that many Ontarians do not want, at the bare minimum follow the EAA processes to reduce the impact of it's creation.\n"
