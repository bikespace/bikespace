        "comment": "Baseline, this just doesn\u2019t make sense, the bike lanes already exist and cost just as much to install as it will to remove, this is not a sensible use of tax dollars. On top of that, this is infrastructure that actually gets used, both bikes and cars are legitimate choices to get around the city and the lanes allow both to safely share the road.\n"

This city\u2019s bike lanes have made my life so much easier since many trips are too far to walk but not worth finding parking.  Biking has made me healthier, more active in the shops and the thing the city has to offer.  Bikes aren\u2019t going anywhere but will be sharing the space with cats which will be a headache for us all.\n"

        "comment": "Shifting bike lanes to side streets isn\u2019t a practical solution. Side streets are often narrower and busier, making them less safe for cyclists. They also have more intersections and less connectivity, which increases the risk of accidents and makes biking less convenient. Plus, they\u2019re not as visible, which can discourage people from biking altogether.\nTaking bike lanes off main streets won\u2019t improve car traffic flow; it will likely cause more congestion because fewer people will have a safe alternative to driving. This change disproportionately impacts low-income individuals who rely on biking as an affordable transportation option. We need to keep bike lanes on main roads where they\u2019re most effective and visible. Removing them sends the wrong message about our commitment to cycling. Instead of taking a step back, let\u2019s invest in better bike infrastructure.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose Bill 212. I ride my bike every single day and use it as my primary mode of transportation. I don't own a car, nor do I ever take taxis or ubers. Whenever I travel places, my transportation choices literally mean 1 less car on the road contributing to the congestion this Bill claims to be trying to solve.\nThere have been many great improvements throughout the Province of Ontario in the realm of cycling infrastructure in the last decade. Bill 212 would be a massive step in the wrong direction. Having interacted with city officials, I'm aware that they already encounter many challenges when attempting to roll out safe cycling infrastructure. Bill 212 would introduce significant additional challenges and restrictions making it even more difficult and slower to make our roads safer. This is not an initiative that we can afford to drag our feet on, when our unsafe roads contribute to so many deaths across Ontario every year.\nThe notion that removing bike lanes would solve congestion is absolutely ridiculous and not grounded in evidence or data.\n"

As an avid cyclist and public transport user, I already know that removing cycling lanes is only going to increase risk of death or injury and the volume of traffic on the roads. Please reconsider this horrible plan.\n"

Municipalities are well-equipped to conduct this work already and Provincial oversight is not required and discouraged.\nI would recommend the Province actually spend more money to expand the cycling and transit network, investments that go much further than investments in car infrastructure, which are more costly and require more maintenance (due to the extreme wear and tear.

The issues with traffic in Toronto need to be handled differently. Take example on so many US and European cities and reduce the amount of car within the city, poor money into public transit.\nThe streetcar should not share the road with cars. If it was more reliable less people would use Uber and taxis to go to work. More streets should be one way, cars should not be allowed to park on painted bike lanes.\nThe city shouldn\u2019t let the government interfere in the organization of the road and infrastructures.\nWhat Toronto needs is a reliable public transit and safe bike lanes, not more cars in the city!\n"

        "comment": "Reducing bike lanes is ableist. Driving is only open to those 16 and above to those with sufficient sight, mobility, and cognitive skills to operate high horsepower motorized vehicles. It also precludes those who have had strokes, or live with certain medical conditions including photosensitivities, etc.  Many seniors can no longer drive, but cycling or using power wheelchairs and scooters in bike lanes give independence and opportunities to social networks that they are otherwise denied. For those under 16, those with lived experience with certain disabilities, or for those who have aged beyond their driving years, driving and an obsession with prioritizing independent car transportation limits their mobility, social networks, opportunities to go to events or appointments, and opportunities to take jobs that they are skilled to do, due to lack of non-driving access.  These all impact the real physical, mental, social and economic health and well-being of our community members. The disability community is the largest minority in the world, the ,ost intersectional ine, and the only community that we can join at any time. Why ostracize so many Ontarians, needlessly. To focus solely on driving is nearsighted hubris.\nThis is all before we explore the elitist privilege to own a car that only creates larger divides to the aforementioned opportunities outside of the scope of ableism.\nIf you want the distraction to focus on bike lanes instead of opposition to Hwy 413, consider me distracted. IF you want to sell land to cronies for profit, make it a passenger rail line to carry people easily from east to west between neighbouring communities and not the hub and spoke model of \u201cFirst to Union Station, then final destination\u201d.  Sell the land, but build community train stations with bikeable paths and service-filled communities around those stations. It\u2019s a gold mine that doesn\u2019t need to follow an outdated model of pave a path to freedom which actually leads to isolation, anger, and avoidable fatalities.\n"

It\u2019s increased my family\u2019s safety, it\u2019s cut our commute times, it\u2019s given us active living and positively impacted our physical and mental health, and I am not using a car to co tribute to traffic.  it takes me 30-45min by car, 50-60min by transit, and 30min by bike. It has been emotionally devastating to know this bill values suburban driver comfort over my safety.\n"

There were no bike paths and we were biking on the road, my daughter ahead of me and me behind to make sure I could see anything that might look like a danger. There was a taxi behind us who was impatient and angry that we were on the road - his response was to drive ahead of my daughter and then to keep stopping and starting in front of her (a 10 year old!) so she was forced to stop and start along with him. When he thought he had taught us our lesson, he yelled that we should be on the sidewalk and did not belong on the road.\nNow I am a grandmother in the same situation and can cycle without fear in the bike lane with my granddaughter.\nPlease don't force us back on the sidewalk.\n"
