Ever since bike lanes have been installed I feel more confident and safe to ride my bicycle to commute to/from work, do all the grocery shopping and get around the city. If the lanes get removed i would be extrenely saddened as it would mean i'd have to go back to bothering my elderly husband to drive me around as i dont have a drivers licence. Please consider our safety on the roads, keep the bike lanes!! If i am on my bike that means one less car on the road, more confidence for other elderly to take up cycling too.\n"

        "comment": "1. Overemphasis on Expanding Road Infrastructure\nOne of the central components of the Act is the expansion of road networks and highways to alleviate gridlock. While this may seem like a direct solution to traffic problems, it fails to account for the well-established phenomenon of induced demand. This concept suggests that simply building more roads encourages more people to drive, which can actually increase congestion in the long run. Rather than reducing gridlock, expanding infrastructure often leads to even worse traffic as more vehicles take advantage of the newly constructed lanes, quickly filling them up. This cycle of endless road expansion is not a sustainable solution and could ultimately lead to a \u201cbigger is worse\u201d situation.\n2. Environmental Impact and Urban Sprawl\nThe Act\u2019s focus on road-building and expanding highways also overlooks the environmental consequences of such projects. More roads lead to greater carbon emissions, which is a direct contradiction to Ontario\u2019s climate goals. The construction and maintenance of highways require significant energy and materials, and increased car usage contributes to air pollution and worsens the province's carbon footprint. Additionally, expanding highways encourages urban sprawl, as more land is developed for new housing, businesses, and industries along major roadways. This sprawl can diminish green spaces, harm ecosystems, and increase the pressure on municipal services in new suburban areas.\n3. Neglecting Public Transit and Active Transportation\nThe Act\u2019s focus on roads and highways overlooks the crucial role of public transportation and active transportation (e.g., walking and cycling) in solving gridlock. For Ontario to truly reduce traffic congestion and improve quality of life, the government needs to prioritize investments in transit systems, such as buses, subways, and commuter trains. Expanding these systems would provide Ontarians with viable alternatives to driving, reducing the overall number of vehicles on the road. The Act should also place a stronger emphasis on creating safe cycling lanes and pedestrian pathways to encourage active modes of transport. By neglecting these areas, the government is not addressing the underlying need for sustainable transportation solutions.\n4. Lack of Focus on Congestion Pricing and Demand Management\nInstead of simply building more roads, Ontario should explore solutions that manage traffic demand. Measures like congestion pricing, which charges vehicles to enter high-traffic areas during peak hours, have proven effective in cities around the world, such as London and New York. The Act misses this opportunity to implement more sophisticated strategies to reduce congestion in a way that encourages people to take public transit or adjust their travel habits. Without addressing demand management, the province risks continuing to support a car-dependent culture, which exacerbates gridlock rather than alleviating it.\n5. Impact on Local Communities and Quality of Life\nThe expansion of highways and road networks under this Act could have detrimental effects on local communities. New roads often pass through residential neighborhoods, leading to increased noise, pollution, and the disruption of local businesses. These communities may find themselves trapped between expanding highways and deteriorating environmental conditions, ultimately reducing their quality of life. Additionally, road expansion can lead to displacement of existing residents, particularly in underprivileged areas, who may be forced to relocate due to construction projects or gentrification driven by increased access to transportation corridors.\n6. Missed Opportunity for Innovative Solutions\nInstead of continuing with outdated and car-centric solutions, the Ontario government should be looking for more innovative transportation alternatives. This could include increasing investment in shared mobility services like carpooling, ride-hailing, and autonomous vehicles. There is also potential to integrate smart traffic management systems that can reduce congestion by optimizing traffic flow. These technologies are not given enough attention in the Act, which suggests the government is still focused on old models of transportation infrastructure that may no longer be the most effective in addressing modern challenges.\nConclusion\nWhile the Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act proposes a solution to Ontario's traffic problems, its heavy reliance on expanding road infrastructure and neglect of alternative transportation options are shortsighted and ineffective in the long run. The government\u2019s focus on road construction is likely to exacerbate traffic congestion, contribute to environmental degradation, and encourage urban sprawl. To truly solve Ontario's gridlock issues, the government should prioritize sustainable transportation solutions, such as investing in public transit, improving active transportation infrastructure, and adopting congestion pricing and demand management strategies. Without these measures, the Act risks perpetuating the very problems it intends to resolve.\n"

        "comment": "Adding traffic lanes has been shown not to reduce congestion. Also, the building of highways can destroy ecosystems and harm human communities. The impact is often strongest on low income communities. We have processes in place to protect people and the environment. We should not seek to bypass them.\nA more effective way to reduce congestion is to reduce demand for roads. This government has invested in transit. That should be a priority. Public transit removes a lot of single occupancy cars from the road, leaving it free for those who must drive. Public transit also helps those who cannot drive like teenagers, the elderly, people with certain disabilities and the poor.\nMore structural changes are also necessary. People are commuting too far. This cuts into their leisure time as well as causing congestion. Increasing density near places of employment can help people live nearer their work. Encouraging remote work can also reduce time lost to commuting.\nThere are so many things to be done to reduce congestion without skipping necessary due diligence on highway construction. Please consider some of these.\n"

The City of Toronto political representatives have expressly opposed this Bill 212 amendment that undermines their democratic right and jurisdiction to make decisions about addressing traffic congestion and road safety in regard to bicycle lanes.\nThe Association of Municipalities of Ontario state:\n\"Bicycle lanes are an essential element of urban transportation planning and road safety. Requiring provincial approval would be a significant overreach into municipal jurisdiction.\"\nI am in agreement with the 120 physicians and researchers from the University of Toronto the are opposed to Ontario's legislation Bill 212 where municipalities and cities are limited in the ability for to make their roads safer for their citizens.\nI want and hope the Ontario Government with rescind Bill 212 and restore democracy to our Municipal Governments to make decisions for the road safety of their citizens in their jurisdictions which will always include safe bike lanes as part of their transportation plan.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to Bill 212, the Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act. I am deeply concerned about the potential implications this bill poses for urban mobility, transportation equity, and environmental sustainability in Ontario.\nBill 212 proposes unprecedented provincial control over municipal transportation infrastructure, specifically in mandating provincial approval for the installation of bike lanes that repurpose existing motor vehicle lanes. This approach undermines the ability of municipalities to design transportation solutions tailored to their unique needs. Furthermore, it fails to recognize the well-documented benefits that bike lanes bring to urban environments, including traffic congestion relief, emission reduction, economic development, and enhanced public health.\nAdditionally, Bill 212\u2019s prioritization of Highway 413 construction is concerning. The government\u2019s own modeling shows that this highway will bring very limited benefits to the transportation network and fails to meaningfully address congestion. Decades of research consistently demonstrate that expanding highway capacity ultimately induces more driving demand, leading to further congestion and pollution in the long term. Rather than investing in a project with limited effectiveness, Ontario should prioritize maximizing the use of existing infrastructure through travel demand management and congestion pricing, which are proven methods to reduce highway congestion. Complementing these approaches with investments in extensive transit and cycling alternatives will deliver more sustainable, resilient, and efficient outcomes for our transportation system.\nMost importantly, Bill 212 contradicts the principles of Vision Zero, which aims to eliminate traffic fatalities and serious injuries. Ontario has already experienced too many tragic losses of pedestrians and cyclists. By restricting the ability of municipalities to implement dedicated bike lanes and other safety measures, this legislation would almost certainly increase the risk of fatalities for vulnerable road users. Every death that could have been prevented by safer infrastructure will be a direct consequence of these policies, and the responsibility for these lives lost will rest with the provincial government. We must prioritize the safety of all road users by empowering local governments to implement proven strategies that protect the most vulnerable.\nOntario\u2019s cities are actively working towards transportation equity, offering mobility choices that accommodate people of all ages and abilities. Many residents cannot drive due to age, disability, or financial constraints. Providing safe, accessible bike lanes is essential to ensuring their mobility. Removing these facilities would disproportionately impact those who depend on cycling infrastructure, undermining their right to safe and accessible transportation.\nI urge you to reconsider this legislation and to collaborate with municipalities, transportation experts, and community advocates to develop a plan that genuinely addresses Ontario\u2019s congestion issues by promoting an integrated, equitable, and sustainable transportation system that protects all road users.\nThank you for your attention to these concerns.\n"
