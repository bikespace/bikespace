        "comment": "I think this is a great idea. Removing congestion in downtown will promote cycling and move toronto towards being a more walkable and bike friendly city. It will shift attitude about urban transportation. It will eliminate needless injury and deaths of cyclists who use these risky corridors for cycling.\n"

        "comment": "I am not in favour of this bill as proposed. It is unfounded in research that bike lanes cause congestion. A report authored by WSP found that bicycle lanes reduce travel time on average more than they contribute to it. More lanes for driving only temporarily cut down on traffic before more drivers are incentivized to use them.\nIn addition to this report, there are more residents of Ontario that do not drive than do. Young people, elderly and those who cannot or do not wish to drive make up the majority of the population. It is incongruent with this bill to limit municipalities from implementing their cycling master plans that create safer means of travels for everyone. Cyclists will always exist, making it more dangerous to cycle limits the ability for a majority of the population to get to school, work and appointments independently. Removing safe bike lanes will cause more accidents and as a result more major slow-downs.\nMunicipalities across Ontario have invested significant resources into Transportation and Cycling Master Plans that meet the needs of their communities. It is within municipal jurisdiction to plan for road infrastructure that includes cycling infrastructure. The Province is overstepping by introducing this bill. In addition, adding red tape to municipalities is a great hypocrisy of previous bills, namely the Cutting Red Tape bill.\nFinally, this proposal undermines efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. There is no path forward for a low-emissions future without appropriate and safe cycling infrastructure. Congestion is a problem that is not solved by adding more lanes. Climate change is not solved by more cars on the road. It is proven that safe pedestrian and cycling infrastructure encourages less people to drive, addressing the true root cause of congestion.\n"

Also, builfing more lanes for cars induces more traffis (see link).\n"

        "comment": "It is clear to anyone who takes any time to look at peer reviewed studies that we need to move away from a car centric community to one that moves as many people as possibly in the most efficient way.  We need MORE dedicated and protected bike lanes.  We need MORE dedicated bus/streetcar lanes.  We need MORE access to GO transit from outside the GTA during the weekdays and on weekends.\nRemoving bike lanes is a step backwards.  Slowing down the addition of protected bike lanes is a step backwards.\nMore egregious though is that fact that the Provincial government is overstepping its purview and its reach when trying to push through legislation that takes away or puts up barriers to municipal governments' decision making about their own communities.\nPlease start thinking about the future of our province.  Traffic is an issue because people don't have safe, effective, and enticing options.  Start thinking progressively and put money toward good options.\n"

The Ontario government should act on solid evidence and prioritize a fast development of bike lanes and bike express lanes and increase safety for cyclists and other traffic participants alike. The Ontario government should also not interfere with municipal urban development. Every city and municipality has their unique traffic profile which necitates local, and not provincial solutions.\n"

        "comment": "The Ford government is overstepping and pandering to his voters, rather than making an informed, fair decision to benefit all Ontarians, specifically the millions who live in Toronto. Studies show that increasing roadway for cars only increases traffic, rather than help limit it. Improving public transit and building infrastructure to accommodate commuting/travelling that doesn't require cars (bikes, scooters, walking) is the only way to get less cars on the road, and the only way to improve gridlock for those who choose to travel by vehicle. This has been proven in cities all across the world, and it is unquestionably stupid to think Ford knows better, based not on facts but on the feelings of a small group. The city has spent millions of dollars building bike lanes, and the Ford government has decided that after a short amount of time, it's not working for him. It's disturbing that our government is actively working against the best interest of the citizens of the largest city in the province, to appease foolish people who have somehow turned biking into a political issue. Do better, and do the right thing and do NOT pass this ridiculous bill.\n"

Them having their own lane keeps them out of ours, we as drivers will not be liable, forbid something happen.\nIt in fact decreases congestion due to bikers having their own lane and not sharing with vehicles. With the rate of car accidents, and with an influx of bad drivers in the city we need to do our best to keep each other safe.\n"

        "comment": "This legislation should not be accepted.  Local transportation planning should be in the hands of the Towns and Municipalities who were voted into position by local residents.  Decisions should be made based on empirical data of use, traffic patterns, safety needs and future transportation visioning.   Bike lanes are needed for the safety of cyclists. No more cars causing the deaths of cyclists!! Population explosion and the high cost of living means municipalities need to build for the future and find ways to develop a variety of transportation options that suit a wide variety of residents' needs, not just the preferences of drivers.  Do not take this decision making tool away from the local towns and municipalities. Do not add another layer of red tape complications and costs that will slow down the development of safer and more diverse infrastruction.\n"

Municipalities are the experts on their own needs, and it creates unnecessary red tape to involve the provincial government. Removing existing bike lanes or stopping the addition of approved new ones will be costly in its execution and will inevitably also result in costly litigation. As a resident of a suburb, I understand the frustration of driving into a city. It is frustrating. However, the solution is to reduce cars on the road - this is done by ameliorating other transit options, so I would recommend fully funding and expanding the TTC, for example, as a realistic solution.\n"

I am in favour of encouraging all forms of public transportation and prioritising those over motor vehicle traffic so that more people get to where they need to go faster.\nStudies published online and referenced by CBC demonstrate that bike lanes throughout Europe and North America speed up traffic by putting fewer people in cars.\nPlease don't take away the bike lanes. Drivers are not skilled enough to look out for cyclists, particularly not when they are mixed in with motor vehicles. Removing the bike lanes will put more people in cars or taxis, and will slow traffic down, all while removing a fitness possibility for those that previously biked.\n"
