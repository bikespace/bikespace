        "comment": "Removing already built bike lanes on Bloor, Yonge, and University is moronic. Not only will this be a colossal waste of tax payer money that no one asked for but this will put many lives in danger from collisions.\nThe Ford government wilfully is putting the lives of Ontarians in danger and this is disgusting.\nMaybe look into real solutions like completing and opening the still unfinished Eglinton Crosstown LRT.\nInstead our premier prefers to focus on populist \"one more lane bro\" rhetoric that has been proven across the world not do a thing to solve congestion. This might be new information to our premier but the only way to solve congestion is to provide other viable methods of transportation so people aren't forced to use the car for every trip. Forcing people to use the car for most trips makes traffic congestion worse not better because cars are traffic.\n"

        "comment": "I live in the Bloor West area and strongly support the removal of the bike lanes along Bloor. The traffic often backs up for blocks, making it near impossible to turn left on to street where I live. This alone adds 5-10 minutes to my commute in the evening. I also believe that the lanes should be removed from the Bloor Yonge area as I've seen how they have created gridlock in that area for much of the day.\n"

        "comment": "Absolutely moronic to remove heavily used bike lanes in Downtown Toronto, especially in this day and age.\nWith climate change an obvious reality, and the national increase in depression and citizens poor physical health, removing something that allows for increased physical activity and freedom is insane.\nToronto should be increasing the bike lanes, not reducing them. But I guess Ontario would like to make Toronto a laughing stock booney instead.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal represents a massive overreach that would effectively limit the toolkit my municipal government has to address issues that are important to me like cleaner air, eliminating serious injuries and fatalities from traffic collisions, and even tackling gridlock and congestion woes.\nMunicipal governments have the local knowledge and contextual understanding necessary to effectively address specific community transportation needs. Any provincial legislation that would limit municipalities from serving their communities ultimately undermines local governance and the ability of municipalities to protect the well-being of their residents. All levels of government have a clear public health obligation to ensure roadways are safe for all users.\nFrom a recent Ipsos poll commissioned by the Toronto Region Board of Trade, 86% of respondents agree that there is a traffic and congestion crisis in the region. But when asked about the causes of congestion, folks can plainly see what\u2019s right in front of them: 68% say too much construction and mismanagement of construction schedules, and 57% say too many cars and trucks on the road. Only 21% say the main reason for traffic congestion is due to \u201cother on-street uses (e.g. bike lanes, parking, CafeTO)\u201d. To be clear, that\u2019s not even 21% blaming just bike lanes. That number includes concerns about on-street parking and business-boosting initiatives like streetside patios and cafes. Even with bike lanes consistently and without evidence being scapegoated, the majority of folks refuse to take the bait.\nI urge you to reject making my safety (and my loved ones\u2019 safety) a pawn in a larger culture war. Riding a bike is not a left-right issue. In Toronto alone, six people have been killed riding their bikes so far this year\u2013more than the previous three years combined. The timing of this all is deeply invalidating to everyone who has lost a friend or family member in a traffic collision. Bike lanes save lives. Not every trip will be bikeable, and not every person will choose to ride a bike. But let\u2019s use evidence-based solutions to keep people moving across the province, and not take away the democratic voices of my municipal leaders and my community.\n"

Bike lanes promote health, prosperity, culture and add to the communities they are in. Please refer to the unique ways major,.important cities in the world treat bikes as a serious solution to congestion and climate change.

        "comment": "This is nonsense. The government doesn't seem to understand what \"evidence informed\" means. The best data we have points to bike lanes as improving local economies, safety, and enjoyment of travelling through cities. As for congestion, removing them will not benefit anyone. Again,  check the numerous studies on this. I trust them, not the government's foolish, uninformed opinions.\nHow dare this government say it doesn't want to tell cities what to do in one breathe while pulling this stunt in the next.\n"

        "comment": "A stupid idea. The roads should be for all users not just motorists. If you want to reduce congestion then reduce the number of cars.\nI live off of Montgomery Road in the Kingsway area. I own a car and drive regularly and the only time that I have seen congestion is during the rush hours. Outside of rush hour there aren't that many cars on Bloor St W. I have virtually never seen congestion during the day or at night.\nFirst, the real problem is a lack of synchronization of the traffic lights. That should be fixed before anything else is done. I don't believe these were synchronized before the speed limit was changed from 50 km/h to 40 km/h but now it is largely impossible to get through that stretch of Bloor St W without hitting a string of red lights. I even experienced this at 4:00 a.m. where I had to wait for 5 red lights along Bloor St between Islington Ave and Prince Edward Dr when there was absolutely no one else on the road. The traffic lights at the Bloor/South Kingsway and Bloor/Jane intersections are also a mess and cause a lot of congestion. The problem is the traffic lights not the bike lanes.\nSecond, many of the car drivers who are driving along Bloor St are not from Toronto. They are through traffic and are never going to use the bike lanes. They likely also don't pay City of Toronto taxes. If you want to reduce congestion then you should get more cars off the road. One way to do that is to introduce a road tax for people who don't pay Toronto taxes but still want to use the roads. That would force at least some to find alternative means to get in and out of the city, such as subways, GO trains and so on. I pay Toronto taxes and I use the bike lanes. Bike lanes are for residents.\nThird, putting bike lanes on secondary roads is a bad idea. You can't ride a bicycle far on a secondary road without reaching a major thoroughfare. Then to cross that thoroughfare you need a new traffic light which is only going to slow traffic on the thoroughfare further. Map out a network of cycle routes criss-crossing the city on secondary roads and then count the number of additional traffic lights that you will need. It won't be 5 or 6. There are also few secondary roads that cross the city in either east/west or north/south directions.\nFourth, Bike lanes only start to be really used when a network exists that let people get to where ever they need to get to. Such a network can't be built overnight. The city of Toronto is building the network piecemeal. As the network is expanded more people will use it. I have spent a lot of time in a European city that has a daytime population of about 1.3 million. About 15 years ago they started to create a cycling network that covered most of the city. Usage started as a trickle but now most of the bike lanes are full during the day. When I am there I use a bicycle almost exclusively for travel year round because I can get just about everywhere I need to go by bicycle. And yes, they do have winter and they do have sub-zero temperatures. You only need to look at Montreal as an example in Canada.\nFifth, it makes sense that the bike lanes on Bloor St have been extend to where the new Etobicoke Civic Centre will be built a Six Points (Bloor/Dundas/Kipling). When that is completed there will certainly be more bicycle traffic both from people needing services to city employees who will work there.\nSixth, Doug Ford should stop interfering with city of Toronto business. He ran to be mayor and he lost! The people of the city of Toronto rejected him! The people of the city of Toronto rejected his ideas! He should concentrate on those issues for which he has a mandate. He should do something to improve healthcare. He should do something to improve the education system. He should do something to improve the transportation system. And he should leave the city of Toronto the eff alone!!!\n"

        "comment": "This Bill will make Toronto an outlier in regressive, car-dependent planning. From London and Paris overseas to Montreal and Calgary at home, world class cities everywhere are expanding and upgrading active transportation infrastructure. Toronto is not leading the way on this. Our bike network is modest by comparison. So it came as baffling news to me that the Province is proposing the removal of some of the most heavily utilised bike lanes in our city. We know not just from studies in Toronto, but from cities all over the world, that this will do nothing to lessen gridlock. Gridlock is eased by getting people out of cars and into more efficient modes of transportation. However, I suspect the Province is already well aware of this. I urge the Province to stop playing cynical political games and reverse this regressive policy.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are great but more thought needs to be put into where they go. Streets like Bloor and Yonge can\u2019t feasibly support bike lanes. It creates gridlock and hurts productivity. Additional streets with bike lanes should be re-examined. Like the Bayview extension as the Canary District expands and Mill street which is home to the Distillery District, one of the cities most popular tourist destinations. This area needs less bike lanes and more space for the dozens of tour buses that come on during peak seasons. This stimulates the local economy and supports small businesses. Cyclists are a safety hazard in this busy pedestrian area.\n"

        "comment": "Pulling out bike lanes is the wrong decision, that will have real consequences for cyclists. There's no evidence to support this decision, in fact quite the opposite. Reducing gridlock means getting more CARS off the road, encouraging active transportation, public transportation is the way to go. The cost and congestion that will come with destruction isn't fiscally responsible. I've watched enough debate in the legislature to know, bike deaths are preventable when there's a dedicated lane for cyclists. How many people need to die before this gov pivots? How many children are you willing to put in harm's way? As we stare down the barrel of a climate catastrophe gas guzzling cars need to go.This is such a backwards plan I'm baffled, leaves one wondering who are you pandering to this time around?\n"

Even though I have a car that I drive everyday, I find that bill absolutely stupid and counter productive.

Let's remove all street parking which essentially block a full lane pretty much everywhere before even thinking about removing bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "I cannot comprehend why we are removing brand new bike lanes on Bloor and University. They were considered valuable enough to be funded when they were installed: what changed? Now, the plan is to remove them for an even higher price tag than they cost to put in, all funded by taxes? Why are we paying for the privilege of moving backwards?\nI am a UofT alum and was at school both before and after these being added, so I have personal experience of their positive impact. If the idea is that without bike lanes, bicycles will disappear from the road to free up space for cars... they won't. Bicycles taking the lane is dangerous for the cyclists and not even beneficial for cars, which will need to slow down constantly to match a bike's speed. Cyclists will not simply leave downtown roads, because despite their potential danger they are the most straightforward commute paths. Please reconsider.\n"

Look at most major cities on our globe: they have invested heavily in different public transit methods like trains, subway, bike lanes, LRT, bus, etc.\nSuch investment to promote other means of transportation is an improvement to all.

Bike lanes provide clear distinction between the different modes of transportation on streets, and the provincial government does not have the insight on where these should be placed. What really displeases me however, is the distinct lack of competency when it comes to spending millions of taxpayer dollars to tear up perfectly working street designs in the City of Toronto. As the provincial healthcare system falls apart, as bridges across the province crumble into neglect, the Ford Government chooses to spend our money to ruin streets, create more traffic, and overreach levels of government for a higher chance of a vote. Stop playing political games and actually work on improving our province, thank you!\n"
