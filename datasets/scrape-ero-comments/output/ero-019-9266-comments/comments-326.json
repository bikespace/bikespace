        "comment": "Removing bike lanes is not a means of reducing congestion and gridlock. The problem is cars, not bikes. This has been proven repeatedly by studies conducted across this country and around the world. Adding more space for cars does NOT make congestion better; it's makes it WORSE. Doug Ford, previously quoted as being a supporter of cycling in cities, is using this as a way to create a divide among voters. Besides being entirely unfounded and counterproductive this creates MORE danger for cyclists, pedestrians, and drivers not LESS. This bill actually reduces the city's ability to create better cycling and active transportation connections (which would be a real solution to congestion) and reduces their ability to make meaningful improvements. If the province wants to see a reduction in congestion they would be investing in public transportation for cities not more car infrastructure. Not to mention that removing bike lines does not actually add much room to a road that already has an established footprint. I think the reality is that Doug Ford doesn't care about congestion. If he did, he would be putting fourth bills with grit and that are research backed.\nI am completely unsupportive of this bill and believe it is an abuse of provincial power. Cities have staff and political leaders to act in the public's interest. The province should not be involved in the minutia of cities.\n"

        "comment": "The Ontario government's plan to remove the bike lanes on Bloor St., Yonge St., and University Ave. in the City of Toronto and to return them to a lane of traffic, will not reduce gridlock for cars. Doing this will increase the number of cars on the road and worsen public safety. Doing this is a waste of taxpayers's money and Ontario should focus on investments to improve public transit services/infrastructure and bike lane infrastructure in the City of Toronto. The Government of Ontario can support making existing roads more efficient at moving cars, bikes and pedestrians, for example by implementing one-way traffic on roads resulting in higher traffic flow and enforcement of \"blocking the box\" issues in congested major intersections. Thank you for your consideration.\n"

You are lying about the impact of bike lanes on local businesses. BIAs do not support this rash and uninformed decision.\n3. This is enormous waste of money. Why in god's name are you ripping up recently completed infrastructure?!?\n4. Stay in your lane -- literally. You are not the mayor of Toronto.\n5. Bike lanes REDUCE congestion. Like many Torontonians, I am both a cyclist and a driver. Bloor is now one of the best streets in Toronto for both modes. If I'm in my car, I will choose Bloor over other arterials: the designated left turn lanes, bike lanes, and parking lanes meant that the driving lane is actually for driving!\n"

        "comment": "From spring time to late fall, I use the bike lanes in Toronto to get to and from my Apartment in midtown to my partner\u2019s downtown.\nThe bike lanes get me moving, (exercise) Improving my health. (Reducing impact on healthcare) I discover new business (supporting the local economy) and with the bike lanes, I don\u2019t fear for my life. I don\u2019t want to become the next person struck and killed by a car.\nWe\u2019ve all seen the videos of cars driving on side walks (often on Spadina) Being on the roads, or even the sidewalks, is not safe. Taking the TTC is full of delays and is becoming more and more unsafe everyday. Most times, when I bike from downtown, I get home faster than if I would have taken the TTC or a car. I can bike from Queen and Bathurst to Yonge and Bloor faster than it takes me to walk from Queen and Bathurst to Osgoode Station.\nIf there were more bike lanes, I would take a bike more often than I already do. The city\u2019s transport system is broken. The CITY, not the province, should add more protected bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "This is a terrible idea. Firstly, why are you removing bike lanes that were just built? A waste of taxpayer money.\nSecondly, the rates of bike riders is different for different parts of the province. This means that Toronto has different requirements for bike lanes than Mississauga. Why is the province painting the entire province with the same brush?\nThirdly, the reason why major roads are major is because they are a straight shot to connecting different parts of the city. For example, Bloor spans several km connecting central DT Toronto to the west end. There is no way to mimic this route by sideroads bike because it has to zigzag through various side roads.\nI am a driver first, and a biker second. I bike through the summer and winter. When deciding whether I should bike or drive, I look at the route to see how safe and complex it is compared to driving. As the infrastructure has been getting built, I have been biking more and more which indicates that I am taking 1 car away from congestion. Undoing the bike lanes will effectively add cars back to congestion.\nIf this law passes, myself and others will ride our bike in the middle of the lane instead of off to the side. Do you think that will increase or decrease congestion?\n"

        "comment": "This is such a tremendous overreach of the provincial government - I do NOTsupport this legislation. I am not a bike user and I live in Etobicoke, where there has been much debate about the installation of bike lanes along Bloor Street W. I too have experienced congestion, but that congestion existed well before the bike lanes were implemented. This is terrible legislation that is moving us backwards rather than forwards. This legislation does not seem at all evidence based. Waste of tax payor dollars, especially since this is the type of legislation that will no doubt end up in court for years (wasting more tax payor dollars).\n"

        "comment": "I am a car owner and resident of downtown Toronto. I drive a lot, but I also take the TTC and cycle for commuting a lot as well. As a driver in the city, traffic can be maddening, but it isn't as maddening as encroaching on the right of the city to determine which lanes should have bike lanes.\nI strongly oppose Bill 212 because it infringes on the right of the city to determine how they manage traffic. Also, the section which reads: \"The framework is proposed to require the province to remove sections of the Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue bike lanes in the City of Toronto.\" will make traveling downtown significantly more dangerous. I am an able bodied cyclist and I like to think that I am skilled enough to weave in and out of traffic, but not everyone is like me. I cycle along Bloor, Yonge, and University all the time and not everyone is as fast/agile as I am. Seniors and teenagers cycle too, they need to be protected from traffic.\nPlease, I urge the province to do the right thing.\n"

        "comment": "As a Torontonian who sold their car just this year and now bikes, walks or uses TTC to commute, I find this proposal not only irresponsible, but dangerous. Also, a complete overreach of the provincial government's authority. Municipalities know what is best for the people who live in their cities. I\u2019ve used the Bloor bikes lanes quite a bit over the last few years and three of my heath care specialists are located along University. It finally feels safe to ride my bike to get to my doctors appointments since the University bike lanes were installed/expanded. I also rode the Yonge bike lanes this month for the first time to run an errand, something I would NEVER have even thought of doing before the lanes existed. I will definitely use them again if they\u2019re left in place.\nI truly can\u2019t believe that the people of Ontario would prioritize a 1-3 minute reduction in drive time (what\u2019s been reported as the impact on Bloor since the bike lanes were expanded) over the safety - and in some cases lives - of their neighbours. This government is ignoring studies done all over the world that show adding more lanes just leads to more traffic, and that adding bike lanes, when implemented well, can actually lead to a reduction in traffic.\nPlease do not remove existing bike lanes or prevent new ones from being added in our cities! Some of us need to commute by bike. Not all of us can afford to own a car anymore, and I think my life, my husband\u2019s life, and the lives or my friends who ride are worth more than a couple of minutes saved in travel time for drivers. It\u2019s heartbreaking to see that Premier Ford doesn\u2019t feel that way. I want to make it home alive when I need to ride my bike. My loved ones count on that. This bill should not pass! And the Premier should stop treating those of us outside of cars like second class citizens.\n"
