Local officials we elected by their local constituents and should not be overridden by a higher level of government.  I think the Province of Ontario would have a big problem if the federal government decided to stop their projects\n2.  The local planners have the best knowledge of the local traffic conditions and have all the studies needed to make these decision on behalf of their citizens.   If the local population doesn't like it, they can always remove the officials they don't like.\n3.  The clearly defined bike barriers adds more safety for cyclists\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose Bill 212 and feel compelled to speak out because bike lanes have had such a positive impact on our city and my own experience as a resident of Toronto and casual cyclist. They are essential for safety, giving cyclists a protected space on busy streets, slowing down busy streets for our children,  and reducing the risk of serious accidents.\nBut bike lanes do so much more than keep people safe\u2014they make our neighborhoods more lively and connected.\nWhen streets are accessible to bikes and pedestrians, local businesses thrive, people spend more time outside, and our communities become more vibrant places to live. it\u2019s obvious that bike lanes are not just for cyclists - they improve communities & streets for all.\nThe argument that bike lanes increase congestion just doesn\u2019t hold up. As countless studies show, removing them will likely force more people into cars, worsening the very traffic problems they\u2019re meant to solve. Corridors like Bloor, Yonge, and University are vital for biking\u2014they connect neighborhoods and provide safe routes for people who choose cycling as their primary way to get around, or would like that option for safety, fitness or convenience.\nLastly, the cost of tearing out existing bike lanes is staggering and completely unjustifiable. That money could be spent improving infrastructure, not rolling back progress and creating more problems in the long term.\nI urge you to reject Bill 212 and protect the bike lanes that make our city safer, livelier, and more sustainable for everyone.\n"

        "comment": "This is obscene and should not be validated. Multiple examples in Europe - with arguably more narrow and antiquated infrastructure and streets - support and in fact thrive with bike lanes. As a physician, promoting more driving as opposed to cycling or even using public transportation have been shown to be harmful - it promotes obesity and decreased movement. Combatting gridlock is not achieved by increasing more lanes - studies of highways show that when more lanes are added, it doesn\u2019t decrease traffic, but ironically, it INCREASES traffic because MORE people use that method of transportation. We also haven\u2019t allowed enough time for the cycling lanes to really show their long-term benefits. We need more data points, and evidence based analysis. Bike lanes should be maintained. Public health officials should be consulted in this decision.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes provide a much safer environment for people to travel through metropolitan areas. Particularly along routes with heavy or fast-moving vehicular traffic where biking in the same lane as vehicles poses a much higher risk to bicycle riders. Particularly in the City of Toronto, biking on the road with vehicles (particularly on main roads such as Bloor St, Yonge St, & University Avenue) is outright dangerous. Drivers of vehicles do not respect the rights of bike traffic to take the lane, or pass bikes on the road at a safe distance. Drivers often are not aware of their surroundings and do not look for bikes before maneuvering. Bike lanes are a proven measure to increase the safety of cyclists against collisions with vehicles - potentially fatal collisions.\nBike lanes promote healthy and eco-friendly methods of transportation that should be supported and encouraged, similar to public transit. Removing bike lanes or introducing additional hurdles to install new bike lanes is not an initiative that prioritizes the best interest or safety of the public.\nTravel by personal vehicles is a luxury experience that is not accessible to many - particularly given the current cost of living crisis. The proposed legislation would remove accessible infrastructure and replace it with infrastructure that is only accessible to only a portion of the population.\nRemoving bike lanes that have already been installed and are serving the community is not a responsible use of public funds. Should bike lanes be removed from main thoroughfares, stipulations should be put in place to establish bike lanes on side streets along the same routes to allow people to continue to travel by bike safely throughout the city in a dedicated lane that is separated from cars.\nPeople will be injured and killed with increased frequency following the removal of bike lanes in Toronto and other cities in Ontario if this legislation is implemented.\nThe proposed legislation is prioritizing convenience over the safety of the public. This is unacceptable.\n"

        "comment": "Hi!\nI am strongly against this motion. Cities need to be able to make local decisions about local issues- such as the inclusion of a bike lane- without being caught up in bureaucratic red tape.\nAdding (or re-adding) traffic lanes will not solve congestion. Energy needs to be focused on addressing actual causes of congestion in cities- intersections and car volume- not on implementing \"solutions\" that are proven to not work, such as widening streets. Narrower streets are also safer for everyone, as motorists won't travel as fast down these city pathways.\nAs we move into the future, we need to design cities that meet accessibility needs and reduce our carbon emissions- neighbourhoods being bikeable and walkable is a step toward that.\nParticularly in large cities like Toronto, there is no safe way to travel by bike without bike lanes. The streets-particularly if there is parking- are unsafe and unpredictable, especially during rush hours and inclement weather. Bikes on the road add to the stress, annoyance, and need for vigilance for drivers- having designated (ideally not just painted but raised) bike lanes saves everyone a headache & makes the roads safer for everyone.\nBikers can't ride on the sidewalk because- aside from it not being legal- the sidewalks are busy with pedestrians. A designated bike lane gives people on bikes, e scooters, motorized mobility devices, and others on wheels a safer place to travel without annoying or endangering pedestrians.\nFolks without cars and those who can't drive- including youth, some elderly, and some people with disabilities - benefit from having safe and reliable alternate modes of transport. More connections mean people can participate in community more and reduce isolation, regardless of whether they own a car.\nAnd the better our cities' bike infrastructure becomes, the more connected the networks and safer the lanes- the more people will use them, getting people moving and some cars out of our congested arteries.\nYes, there will be times where a bike lane doesn't make the most sense in a certain spot, or there could be a different implementation that would work better- but this kind of super-local issue is something municipalities should be able to work out with their constituents, and not need to go through a review at Queens Park.\nFinally, regarding the proposed dismantling of the bike lanes on Yonge, Bloor, and University in Toronto-- Please, no. These routes are essential in navigating the city, and in a city plagued by construction projects going over time and over budget, it is incredibly frustrating when politicians want to tear out something that was just built. Let the bike lanes serve their purpose, and maybe instead of tearing up all that roadway yet again, put the money into maintaining our transit or something.\nThank you.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to strongly oppose Bill 212. The proposed changes are deeply concerning, particularly regarding bike lanes, taxpayer money, and broader implications like environmental impacts and provincial overreach. Here are my key concerns:\nBike Lane Removal Jeopardizes Safety:\nRemoving bike lanes on Bloor, Yonge, and University will drastically reduce safety for cyclists, including my children. Data from the City of Toronto shows a 56 percent reduction in cyclist injuries after the installation of bike lanes on Bloor Street, despite a 40 to 90 percent increase in cycling activity. Removing these lanes will reverse this progress and make our streets more dangerous.\nNo Traffic Improvements\nThe argument that bike lanes cause traffic congestion is not supported by evidence. For example, Montreal has successfully integrated an extensive bike lane network without negatively impacting traffic flow. Studies from Montreal demonstrate that well-designed bike lanes separate modes of transportation effectively, reducing conflicts and making streets more efficient for all users. City staff in Toronto also reported that removing bike lanes will result in minimal improvements in vehicle travel times, while the construction required for their removal will disrupt traffic for years. Removing bike lanes will discourage cycling as a viable transportation option, likely increasing car usage and further exacerbating congestion.\nWaste of Taxpayer Money\nThe estimated cost of removing the bike lanes is at least 48 million dollar,a staggering waste of taxpayer funds. These funds could be better allocated to projects that genuinely improve traffic flow, such as enhancing public transportation or repairing existing infrastructure. As a taxpayer, I am frustrated that my money is being directed toward dismantling infrastructure that has proven safety and environmental benefits.\nEnvironmental Concerns\nBill 212 proposes fast-tracking highway projects, such as Highway 413 and the Bradford Bypass, by bypassing environmental assessments. These exemptions threaten local ecosystems and ignore the long-term consequences of increased vehicle emissions and habitat destruction. Removing bike lanes and prioritizing car-centric policies contradict the province\u2019s stated sustainability goals and will worsen urban pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.\nProvincial Overreach\nThe bill undermines local governance by requiring municipalities to obtain provincial approval for bike lanes that reduce vehicle traffic lanes. Municipalities know their unique transportation needs better than the province and should retain the ability to make these decisions without interference. This overreach erodes trust in local leadership and sets a dangerous precedent for provincial control over municipal planning.\nConclusion:\nBill 212 is a regressive step that prioritizes short-term, car-centric policies over long-term, sustainable, and community-focused solutions. It puts my family\u2019s safety at risk, wastes taxpayer dollars, and disregards environmental and local governance concerns. I urge the government to reconsider and focus on strategies that benefit all road users and protect our environment.\n"

        "comment": "Ontario's Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, which aims to improve transportation infrastructure and reduce traffic congestion, is a proposal that may sound promising on the surface, but upon closer examination, it reveals several flaws that could worsen the problem it seeks to address and ultimately lead to long-term negative consequences.\n1. Overemphasis on Expanding Road Infrastructure\nOne of the central components of the Act is the expansion of road networks and highways to alleviate gridlock. While this may seem like a direct solution to traffic problems, it fails to account for the well-established phenomenon of induced demand. This concept suggests that simply building more roads encourages more people to drive, which can actually increase congestion in the long run. Rather than reducing gridlock, expanding infrastructure often leads to even worse traffic as more vehicles take advantage of the newly constructed lanes, quickly filling them up. This cycle of endless road expansion is not a sustainable solution and could ultimately lead to a \u201cbigger is worse\u201d situation.\n2. Environmental Impact and Urban Sprawl\nThe Act\u2019s focus on road-building and expanding highways also overlooks the environmental consequences of such projects. More roads lead to greater carbon emissions, which is a direct contradiction to Ontario\u2019s climate goals. The construction and maintenance of highways require significant energy and materials, and increased car usage contributes to air pollution and worsens the province's carbon footprint. Additionally, expanding highways encourages urban sprawl, as more land is developed for new housing, businesses, and industries along major roadways. This sprawl can diminish green spaces, harm ecosystems, and increase the pressure on municipal services in new suburban areas.\n3. Neglecting Public Transit and Active Transportation\nThe Act\u2019s focus on roads and highways overlooks the crucial role of public transportation and active transportation (e.g., walking and cycling) in solving gridlock. For Ontario to truly reduce traffic congestion and improve quality of life, the government needs to prioritize investments in transit systems, such as buses, subways, and commuter trains. Expanding these systems would provide Ontarians with viable alternatives to driving, reducing the overall number of vehicles on the road. The Act should also place a stronger emphasis on creating safe cycling lanes and pedestrian pathways to encourage active modes of transport. By neglecting these areas, the government is not addressing the underlying need for sustainable transportation solutions.\n4. Lack of Focus on Congestion Pricing and Demand Management\nInstead of simply building more roads, Ontario should explore solutions that manage traffic demand. Measures like congestion pricing, which charges vehicles to enter high-traffic areas during peak hours, have proven effective in cities around the world, such as London and New York. The Act misses this opportunity to implement more sophisticated strategies to reduce congestion in a way that encourages people to take public transit or adjust their travel habits. Without addressing demand management, the province risks continuing to support a car-dependent culture, which exacerbates gridlock rather than alleviating it.\n5. Impact on Local Communities and Quality of Life\nThe expansion of highways and road networks under this Act could have detrimental effects on local communities. New roads often pass through residential neighborhoods, leading to increased noise, pollution, and the disruption of local businesses. These communities may find themselves trapped between expanding highways and deteriorating environmental conditions, ultimately reducing their quality of life. Additionally, road expansion can lead to displacement of existing residents, particularly in underprivileged areas, who may be forced to relocate due to construction projects or gentrification driven by increased access to transportation corridors.\n6. Missed Opportunity for Innovative Solutions\nInstead of continuing with outdated and car-centric solutions, the Ontario government should be looking for more innovative transportation alternatives. This could include increasing investment in shared mobility services like carpooling, ride-hailing, and autonomous vehicles. There is also potential to integrate smart traffic management systems that can reduce congestion by optimizing traffic flow. These technologies are not given enough attention in the Act, which suggests the government is still focused on old models of transportation infrastructure that may no longer be the most effective in addressing modern challenges.\nConclusion\nWhile the Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act proposes a solution to Ontario's traffic problems, its heavy reliance on expanding road infrastructure and neglect of alternative transportation options are shortsighted and ineffective in the long run. The government\u2019s focus on road construction is likely to exacerbate traffic congestion, contribute to environmental degradation, and encourage urban sprawl. To truly solve Ontario's gridlock issues, the government should prioritize sustainable transportation solutions, such as investing in public transit, improving active transportation infrastructure, and adopting congestion pricing and demand management strategies. Without these measures, the Act risks perpetuating the very problems it intends to resolve.\n"

        "comment": "To whom it may concern in the Ontario government,\nI am writing to voice my concerns and serious dismay regarding the potential removal of cycle tracks on Bloor St., Yonge St., and University Ave. Not only will it put the lives of my friends and family directly at risk, but it will also make Toronto and Ontario less attractive places for the world's top talent looking for a vibrant and innovative place to live.\nRegarding safety, I have several close friends who don't have cars and use these cycle tracks on a daily basis. One of my best friends uses the Bloor cycle track to get to work downtown from his home along Bloor St. Three of my friends frequently use University Ave. to traverse downtown and access businesses such as gyms. These people do not have cars, and these cycle tracks serve as lifelines for getting around the city. If they are removed, not only will many of the city's amenities will become more inaccessible to them, but their lives will also be put in direct danger as they ride in mixed traffic with cars and trucks, so I will be terribly worried for their safety. Over half of households in Toronto's densest wards in the urban core do not own cars (see TTS survey in the attached URL), and cycle tracks make our city's streets more accessible and safer for these households.\nRegarding making Toronto less attractive, I can speak from experience. I am a Torontonian PhD student studying engineering in Boston-Cambridge. I grew up in Toronto and went to U of T for undergrad; I love the city and wish to make it my home in the future. Currently living in Cambridge, Massachusetts, I have discovered the benefits of safe and comprehensive cycling infrastructure. The city has invested significantly in connecting different areas with safe cycle tracks along main streets. This has empowered many people like me, who came to Cambridge to take part in its innovative academic and entrepreneurial organizations, to be able to get around efficiently, safely, and affordably without owning a car. It has enabled me to see my friends, attend community events, and access local businesses and restaurants without stressing about parking or getting stuck in traffic. This demonstrates how cycle tracks provide an alternative way to get around that makes sense in dense neighbourhoods such as Toronto's innovative urban core. If all the newcomers in these densifying neihbourhoods drove, our streets would be even more congested and grimy, no matter how many car lanes there are, making our city a worse place to live. I dream of moving back to Toronto after finishing my PhD, but if I am faced with a Bloor St. that is grimy, congested, and unsafe, then I would seriously have to reconsider that choice and perhaps choose more livable cities like Cambridge instead.\nI desperately plead for my elected representatives in Ontario's government to respect the needs of residents in Toronto's densest neighbourhoods by preserving these crucial cycle tracks. They enable safe, affordable, and efficient transportation for many people, make our main streets vibrant and attractive, and make our city more livable and competitive on the global stage.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is based on an entirely flawed premise. Removing the bike lane doesn't add a lane for car traffic, as removing the bike lane doesn't remove the cyclists or on-street parking. The cyclists will continue to exist (as they should) in the right-hand lane, and cars won't be able to use that lane as a full lane anyway.\nThis phenomenon happens all the time on other corridors like Jarvis or Spadina, where there is no dedicated bike lane--drivers just avoid the right lane because cyclists are moving slower than the speed of traffic. Removing the bike lanes would just cost an enormous sum and have no impact on the flow of traffic. If anything, the construction required to remove the bike lanes would slow down traffic for months!\nMaybe the people proposing this change should consider taking public transit or biking to work. Drivers aren't above traffic, they ARE traffic. The bike lanes on University and Bloor are well-researched, well-implemented solutions. Bike lanes dramatically reduce accidents for both motorists AND cyclists.\nThe thing that would actually improve traffic flow the most is better enforcement of motorists. Plenty of motorists illegally make left turns during rush hour with no consequences, fail to yield to TTC buses, or blow right by streetcars with open doors. Drivers get stuck in the middle of intersections frequently, and while the fine for that has gone up, there has been no notable improvement or enforcement.\nPut the $50 million into public transit.\n"
