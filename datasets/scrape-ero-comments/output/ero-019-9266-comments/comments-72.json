        "comment": "There is no reason for the provincial government to interfere with municipal manners like this.\nThe older cities like downtown Toronto or Ottawa, were built before the car and therefore most streets were not designed to be wide enough for both vehicle travel lanes and bike lanes.  As such, these cities must decide between removing a lane to add in a bike lane or keeping the status-quo (which is often no bike lane or a 'painted lane' that offers no protection to cyclists).\nI understand that congestion is a serious issue that cities and the province must tackle as our population grows but removing existing bike lanes and adding more bureaucratic barriers to building these infrastructure will not solve congestion.  For example, look at downtown Toronto.  There is gridlock in many major streets regardless if there is an existing bike lane or not.  The reason for congestion is because the city street grid was not built to handle the sheer amount of automobile traffic that enters the city (especially via the Gardiner and Don Valley expressways).\nThe bill makes reference to 'getting drivers where they need to go faster' but it doesn't acknowledge other forms of transit.  Pedestrians, cyclists and public transit users are also just as important (if not more important in the context of downtown Toronto).  Will the province make bills that 'gets pedestrians, cyclists or transit users where they need to go faster'?  Drivers already have various highways and large arterial roads to drive on.  Cyclists barely have dedicated infrastructure themselves and pedestrians often have to deal with walking on streets that feel unsafe or uncomfortable.\nIf the province wants to 'fight gridlock', they can instead focus on speeding up the construction for various transit projects like the Eglinton LRT, Dundas BRT, Durham BRT and the GO Expansion Project.  They should also support new projects as well like the modernization of the Toronto streetcar so that it reflects the quality of streetcar systems found in Europe or by expanding GO rail service by adding new lines that serve new areas (e.g. a midtown line, the Bolton line) and by adding new stations in an urban area to aid intraurban travel (e.g. new stations in Downtown Toronto, Hamilton, Kitchener-Waterloo that let people travel within the same city and not just to and from another city).\nIf the province wishes truly wishes to be involved with traditionally municipal manners like this, then I hope that the province is willing to also partially fund the 'studies' for building future bike lanes and maybe even partially funding that actual construction of bike infrastructure.\n"

The bike lanes along Bloor allow me and my family to get to activities across Toronto safely and efficiently, in a manner that provides excercise and uses no fossil fuels.  In addition to being gross provincial over reach, by removing the bike lanes you are endangering the lives of me and my children.\n"

        "comment": "Premier Doug Ford is abusing his power. Torontonians should not have to suffer because he got his feelings hurt when he lost the mayoral election. Municipalities should have a degree of independence to govern based on their resident\u2019s needs. Toronto is a bustling city that benefits greatly from having safe cycling infrastructure. I\u2019m sorry that Premier Ford can\u2019t imagine himself riding a bike, but many of us across the province rely on cycling as our primary mode of transportation. Perhaps instead of blaming traffic on bike lanes, the province should be reconsidering street parking on major arterial roads and investing into mass transit infrastructure to move as many people as possible. Removing bike lanes won\u2019t solve the problem, people need viable alternatives to driving. This is a disgrace.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my frustration and disappointment at the proposal of the provincial government to remove bike lanes in Toronto. As a driver and cyclist in this city, I rely on bike lanes to keep my drive safe and fast and reduce stress. These bike lanes are extremely well utilized in the city and reduce congestion and traffic. In addition, our municipal property taxes paid for them, and the absolutely waste of having them removed over a year later is an insult to our governing systems. A government with a minister of \"red tape reduction\" should know better than to waste precious time and resources removing infrastructure when we are facing a cost of living crisis, health care emergencies, and housing issues. Focus on what ontarians need!!\n"

If you want to get rid of traffic, get rid of cars. Create better alternative transportation. I am deeply sadden in the direction of Ontario going. We could be like Europe; where cars, bikes, scooters, and trains co-exist. Don't be like America. We are better than that.\n"

I am not a cyclist and never will be due to injury, but as a motorist, I see how segregated bike lanes have helped to improve safety and traffic flow. More people will get out of their cars and take their bikes if they have the safety and security of bike lanes, which means less traffic. Stop wasting time and tax dollars on this and focus your attention on our failing health care system.\n"

        "comment": "I have two questions that Doug ford so far hasn\u2019t answered, despite them being genuine questions:\n1) if Doug is so worried about reducing congestion, then how is getting rid of a bike lane and forcing bikes into car lanes going to do that? Has he ever driven behind a bike? It significantly slows down traffic because the cars behind have to go the same speed as the bike in front of them. As a driver, I vastly prefer bikes having their own lanes so I can go faster in mine without having to slow down because a bike doesn\u2019t have its own lane and has to now ride in front of me\n2) if Doug\u2019s actual goal was to reduce congestion, then why stop at removing bike lanes from roads? Frankly the biggest issue is whole cars parked in open lanes on the side of the road. Those cars actually reduce a whole lane of traffic. Why is parking on the side of major city arteries allowed?? I don\u2019t ride a bike, I drive. But it\u2019s hard not to feel like this is an attack on people who choose to bike given cars that are parked taking up a WHOLE LANE of traffic isn\u2019t being discussed at all in this, but tiny bike lanes on the side of the road are being proposed to be removed\u2026\nCan the premier or anyone on his team please give an answer to these two questions? Because neither have been addressed to this point, I\u2019m really forced to believe this issue isn\u2019t about congestion at all and seems to be some weird populist vendetta against bikes in service of pushing more people to drive which \u2026 only increases congestion.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose Ontario Bill 212 \u2013 Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024, as it could severely limit the development of much-needed bike lanes by creating unnecessary barriers to removing traffic lanes. This approach is counterproductive and ignores the proven benefits of well-designed cycling infrastructure in reducing overall traffic congestion, improving road safety, and fostering more sustainable urban environments.\nEvidence from cities around the world highlights the positive impact of bike lanes on traffic efficiency and public safety. For example, a study conducted by the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP) found that cities with comprehensive cycling networks, such as Copenhagen and Amsterdam, experience lower levels of traffic congestion because more people opt for cycling as a convenient and efficient mode of transport. This shift not only reduces the number of cars on the road but also contributes to smoother traffic flow for those who continue to drive.\nFurthermore, in New York City, the installation of protected bike lanes led to a 14% reduction in traffic-related injuries for all road users, including drivers, pedestrians, and cyclists, according to a report by the New York City Department of Transportation. The same report also highlighted that bike lanes can lead to reduced travel times for vehicles by organizing traffic more effectively, contrary to the belief that they create additional gridlock.\nResearch from McGill University shows that cities with robust cycling infrastructure, like Montreal, have seen significant public health benefits, including lower air pollution levels and increased physical activity among residents. Encouraging more people to bike, by making streets safer and more accessible for cyclists, is also aligned with Ontario\u2019s climate goals. Transportation is one of the largest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, and shifting a portion of trips to bikes can substantially reduce emissions and contribute to meeting the province\u2019s climate targets.\nOntario should focus on forward-thinking urban planning that promotes multimodal transportation solutions rather than prioritizing single-occupancy vehicles. By limiting bike lane development, Bill 212 risks stalling progress on climate action, public health improvements, and long-term traffic reduction strategies.\nLimiting or removing bike lanes would have long-term negative effects on Ontario\u2019s job growth and overall economy.\nLoss of Jobs in Infrastructure Development: Investments in cycling infrastructure create jobs in construction, engineering, and urban planning. The construction of bike lanes, pedestrian pathways, and other active transportation infrastructure stimulates local economies by providing employment opportunities and generating economic activity. According to the League of American Bicyclists, cycling infrastructure creates 46% more jobs per dollar spent compared to road-only projects. By removing or limiting the expansion of bike lanes, Ontario risks missing out on job creation in this sector.\nNegative Impact on Green Jobs and Innovation: As Ontario moves toward a green economy, cycling infrastructure plays a key role in sustainable urban development. The province has the opportunity to be a leader in green transportation solutions by investing in cycling infrastructure, which supports new job opportunities in clean tech, urban mobility, and environmental sectors. A report by the International Labour Organization (ILO) suggests that a shift toward sustainable transportation systems, including cycling infrastructure, can create thousands of green jobs, contributing to long-term economic growth. By restricting bike lane development, Ontario may fall behind other regions that are prioritizing investments in green transportation, limiting its potential to attract businesses and investments focused on sustainability.\nIncreased Costs of Congestion and Reduced Productivity: Without viable cycling alternatives, more people will rely on cars, exacerbating traffic congestion. According to a C.D. Howe Institute report, traffic congestion already costs the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) an estimated $6 billion per year in lost productivity. Increasing the number of vehicles on the road will only add to these costs, further hampering Ontario\u2019s economic productivity and growth. Encouraging more people to cycle through safe, accessible bike lanes would reduce congestion, improve overall commute times, and increase worker productivity.\nImpact on Tourism and Livability:\nCities with bike-friendly infrastructure attract tourism, boosting local economies. According to the European Cyclists' Federation, cycling tourism generates billions of dollars globally every year. Ontario, with its natural beauty and urban attractions, could attract more cycling tourists with enhanced bike infrastructure.\nHarmful Effects on Ontario\u2019s Economy and Job Growth\nRemoving bike lanes would make Ontario\u2019s cities less attractive to both residents and tourists, negatively affecting local businesses and reducing the province\u2019s overall competitiveness as a livable and appealing destination.\nIn conclusion, the framework proposed in Bill 212 is a step backward. Instead of prioritizing car-centric policies, Ontario should embrace more sustainable and equitable transportation systems that include well-planned bike lanes, which have been shown to reduce traffic congestion, improve road safety, and support a healthier environment.\n"
