        "comment": "Removing bicycle lanes is one of the most ineffective things you could possibly do in an attempt to reduce gridlock. How many real bicycle lanes are there even for you to remove. If you were serious about removing gridlock, implement a rule that ensures that lane closures within the downtown space have to be coordinated in a way that does not make travelling a 5km strip a literal 30minutes nightmare.\n- construction that closes a lane needs to be limited in time or done BEFORE (8am) /AFTER (7pm) office hours\n- lane closures needs to have indication as far as 100m to ensure traffic is aware and can move swiftly (no more zig zagging in attempts to move faster - it actually slows the 2 lanes down further)\n- no trucks stopping in main roads between hours of 8am - 10am and 4pm-6pm and ensure we fine the business owning the truck as well as the operator\n- no street parking of any kind on main streets (we need dedicated parking buildings or lots to replace this of course)\n- add cameras at all intersections within downtown toronto to auto-fine and deduct points for drivers that block the traffic\n- make U-turns on King, Queen, Bloor street illegal\n"

        "comment": "Removing the newly installed bike lanes on major routes like Bloor is the kind of short-term thinking that has caused this issue to begin with.\nWe need to focus on alternative solutions to more cars. Better transit, more walkable areas, and improved bake lanes are what we need more of, not less of.\nYes Toronto traffic is bad, but making it harder to safely bike will have the opposite effect. If I can\u2019t safely bike to visit my family on the east side of the city, i am more likely to drive.\nThis type of decision would keep me from voting for the Fore government in the next election.\n"

        "comment": "There is absolutely no reason to do this, there is no real data to support the idea of bike lanes adding to gridlock. If anything, it's the opposite: the more safe, reliable options you give people to get around the city, the fewer people feel obligated to drive (thus reducing the number of cars on the road). The people in the city of Toronto do not want this and it is an egregious waste of funds that we could be using to solve the housing crisis and improving public transit. Safe cycling infrastructure is the key to solving the gridlock problem and helping to alleviate pollution caused by car traffic. Please focus your time, energy, and funds on what really matters: improving life for the citizens throughout the entire province of Ontario. In addition to my point above about bike lanes actually being a good thing for alleviating traffic, focusing on bike lanes like this is a massive waste of this province's resources and unfair to the residents who do not live in Toronto. Please use the money that would go towards the removal of bike lanes to support the needs of the communities outside of the GTA.\n"

        "comment": "Hi there,\nI\u2019m a resident of Toronto West - High Park/Parkdale Area.\nWhen I moved here 2.5 years ago, I was excited to live close to downtown. It would make it easier to commute and get downtown for events and work.\nHowever, it\u2019s been shown based on multiple ways to get downtown (streetcar, subway, go train, car) that bikes remain the most efficient, quickest and environmentally friendly way to get downtown. We specially subscribed to BikeShare for this purpose.\nWe believe it is an insurmountable waste of resources to remove the bike lanes along University and other areas? Why? It is not proven in anyway that adding more lanes to busy gridlock areas actually \u201cdecreases traffic\u201d. Any evidence  is purely anecdotal and not based in fact whatsoever.\nWe should be investing in proper infrastructure for public transit and bike access. My fianc\u00e9 dislikes biking downtown but with the recent addition of some bikes lanes, she\u2019s taken to using it more often. This is in contract to us taking a four seater car downtown and bogging the roads down even more.\nPlease do not vote this through, there is so proof this is effective and frankly it leads me to believe this government has no care for the community they serve when the focus is put on these priorities. This bill looks to move us backwards in time when we should be putting more emphasis on our environment and not less.\nThank you and please consider this plea from a community member.\n"

        "comment": "Team, this decision is short sighted because you have completely disregarded people like me who cannot afford vehicles, who depend on a free mode of transport like a bike to get around.\nThe Ford govt has been constantly further marginalizing people, focussing on only those who are wealthy enough to own a vehicle, not giving even a lick of thought to pdestrians and cyclists.\nHaving more modes of transport - such as biking, walking, transit, in addition to vehicles will help in easing congestion.\nGuess what will happen when you remove or don't add bike lanes? All us bikers will be on road, occupying the space of 1 whole vehicle. Road rage from large vehicle owners will increase, leading to more collisions from them and death of bikers - that blood is on the Ford govt's hands.\nBecause us poor people don't have a choice, we will need to keep biking - so we will. We will take up the space of vehicles on the road and cause further congestion.\nYou watch us.\n"

Now THERE'S an initiative that would reduce congestion.\nI weep for this province if this is the best approach to reducing congestion our leadership can come up with.\n"

This law should not go through because Doug Ford is trying to divide cyclists and drivers.\nI have a car but I choose to cycle, why is it your right to determine who gets priority on the road?? Shouldn't we all get home safely? There should be more equity and equality in road space for all users and not just people in cars.\nDoug Ford stay in your own lane and focus on solving homelessness and moving people by the masses and not by car.\n"

        "comment": "The background of the proposal states that the government of Ontario \"recognizes the need to build priority highways faster as our province grows in order to get people and goods out of gridlock and save drivers and businesses time and money\". However, the entire proposal focuses on the implementation of bike lanes. Bike lanes do not exist on highways, so how will limiting bike lanes will lead to faster building of highways and how it will reduce congestion on highways? The best way to reduce gridlock and reduce congestion is to reduce the amount of cars on the road. The only way to do that is promote alternative methods of transportation, including public transit, trains and cycling. A better focus for the government of Ontario would be improving these alternate methods of transportation.\n"
