More and safer bike lanes along with wider sidewalks make things safe for humans. Why do cars get all the room?\nMontreal, Paris, Stockholm, they all invest in bike lanes and commuter trains.\nThis will make gridlock and pollution worse and make city streets even more unsafe for anyone not in a car.\n"

This includes a more robust public transit system and promoting active transportation.\n2) Expansion of highways and centring roadways on motor vehicles will only create induced demand, so gridlock will go up not down as people will be incentivized to use single passenger motor vehicles.\n3) Municipal governments are in a much better position to evaluate the needs for and benefits from bike lanes.\n4) The province overruling the decisions of municipal governments is anti democratic.\n"

With the state of the world as it is, it is more important than ever to invest in green transportation and safety.\nThis bill is reckless, ignorant to data, and irresponsible. I would go so far as to say a resignation is in order for those members who tabled this disgrace. I cannot imagine how future generations will see the actions of this government. Destroying greenspaces, privatizing the public commons, and plowing through effective green initiatives to make room for climate destruction is anti-Canadian, anti-environmental, and anti-future.\nShame! Shame! Shame!\n"

        "comment": "People who use active transportation are reducing the number of vehicles on the road, reducing climate change, and improving their own health. Every bicycle on the road is better for those who drive vehicles and are unable or willing to bike. More cyclists reduces traffic congestion. Bike lanes are essential for safety and for encouraging a greater number of cyclists and lowering the number of vehicles.\n"

        "comment": "This bill has it all wrong - bike lanes are effective tools for reducing traffic, and limiting their availability to municipalities as a planning tool is backwards thinking, not to mention the provincial overreach into what is under municipal planning jurisdiction.\nIf the province is serious about reducing traffic, then supporting municipalities with additional funding for active transportation and public transit infrastructure projects would create momentum for less driving. In addition, supporting the growth of inter-city transit, especially rail/GO train links, would also have significant impact on reducing traffic and congestion.\n"

Cyclists deserve the same infrastructure as drivers.\nRemoving bike lanes won\u2019t reduce traffic\u2019s congestion (see \u201cinduced traffic demand\u201d) but it will make cycling less convenient and less safe.\nFinally, decisions regarding city roadways should rest with the municipalities (who are expert on the needs of their citizens) not be legislated by the provincial government for what, frankly, appears to be ideological and political reasons.\n"

Removing bike lanes will only increase the number of people driving which will increase the number of cars on the road which will increase congestion. Induced demand is well known at this point.

        "comment": "Bike lanes and multi use pathways are an integral part of safe transportation in cities and town, and even in rural settings. Bike lanes are mobility lanes, they enable kids and parents to ride to school, and adults to get to work and run errands more safely. Bike lanes provide safer space for people outside of cars to exist. People outside of cars mean that fewer cars are on our roads, which is in fact the actual way to reduce congestion. Better transit, and safer alternatives to driving large vehicles, often with only one passenger, are ways to reduce traffic. Riding a bike is enjoyable, eco-friendly, efficient, and offers a freedom of movement that even seniors and children can participate in and enjoy.\nBike lanes are AN INTEGRAL PART OF TRANSPORTATION IN CITIES AND MUST NOT ONLY REMAIM IN PLACE, BUT BE ADDED TO. In a climate crisis, the only responsible thing a government should be doing with respect to transportation is investing in making it easier for people to NOT DRIVE.\n"

Almost universally local business interests and drivers object only to eventually be defeated by the cold hard facts. Building quality cycling infrastructure makes the roads safer for all, lets people choose to bike, and increases both traffic throughput and average speed while increasing revenue for nearby businesses. The Premier\u2019s anti cycling rhetoric is based on lies and is going to get people killed. This bill cannot be objected to strongly enough.\n"

Blocking new bike lanes and threatening to remove existing bike lanes does nothing to address congestion where we see it most. If bike lanes don't exist, cyclists will still bike and cars will have to accept to share the roads with us, as is our right.\nMoreover, cyclists who feel unsafe riding on roads without bike lanes may well go back to driving their cars (if they have or even want one), thereby increasing what this proposal is meant to alleviate - namely, congestion.\nWe ask you to stop this legislation.\n"

        "comment": "The biggest obstacle to everyone I talk to about why they don't bike is because they don't feel safe. A single driver feels they have more right to the space than a single cyclist even though it's the same number of people. Keeping existing protected bike lanes and building more will encourage more people to start cycling, reducing the number of cars on the road and therefore reducing traffic. The only solution to car traffic are viable alternatives to driving such as cycling and public transit and removing or reducing either is counterproductive to the problem.\n"

By removing the ability to add bike lanes, you're ensuring that people drive, which only creates traffic.\nAdditionally, this is a gross overreach of provincial jurisdiction.  You're taking away a city's tools to do what it wants in its own city, and adding red tape.\n"
