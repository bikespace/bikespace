I was so scared of the city at first and thought we could never ride bikes again, but when I got brave enough to try on Bloor street with my dad it was so fun. i don\u2019t like riding my bike outside a bike lane, it is too scary but i love to ride bikes with my dad every saturday to go and get a treat.\n"

        "comment": "I am largely concerned that the proposed act will be counterproductive, encouraging more drivers on the roads and increasing gridlock. Cycling is a green, sustainable mode of transportation; however, adequate bike infrastructure, such as bike lanes, are crucial for the safety of cyclists. We should be encouraging the use of bike lanes, as opposed to removing existing bike lanes and make them harder to construct. Incentivizing the use of alternative modes of transportation, such as bike lanes, takes cars off the road and can reduce congestion, as opposed to increase it. I am also largely concerned that this act would enable the province to make retroactively make decisions on existing bike lances, undermining the democratic process of municipal governments.\n"

        "comment": "I am strongly opposed to this legislation, especially with regards to bike lanes. Removing bike lanes would be working counter to Ontario's environmental and air quality goals, and would further be a massive waste of taxpayer money. During this time of affordability challenges, the government should be trying to ensure Ontarians have MORE low-cost options for how they move around their cities - not forcing them to rely on expensive, polluting cars more than ever. Furthermore, research has repeatedly shown that widening roads actually worsens traffic congestion, and will not necessarily improve business as many people in urban areas (myself included) rely on bike lanes to safely reach the business they want to patronize. Without bike lanes, there are many local businesses that I will be less likely to support simply because it will be harder and less safe for me to get there. Additionally, it is baffling that the same government that implemented the so called \"strong mayor\" powers would meddle so blatantly in an area that municipalities are clearly better suited to address.\nI am also very opposed to any part of the proposed legislation that would infringe on Ontarians' rights under the Expropriation Act for the purposes of priority highway projects. Ontario should be finding ways to reduce demand for roadways by expanding public transit and active transit infrastructure, rather than forcibly taking people's land to build yet more highways that will ultimately not help to alleviate traffic congestion.\n"

        "comment": "I had to move my family to Toronto from Baden for work, which especially negatively impacted my 10 year old son. He was initially terrified of the change to the big city. One of our favourite ways to bond was to ride bikes together in the country, but I couldn\u2019t convince him to give it a try here (I also would never get him to ride with me on a busy street without a bike lane). One morning out of the blue, he told me he wanted to go for a ride together. I jumped at the opportunity, and we rode all around the bike lane safe routes for hours. It felt like the first time my son accepted Toronto as his new home. This was so special to me, as I used to ride with MY dad when I was a kid. Now, every Saturday we go for a ride together to pick up a snack or check out a new part of town. I\u2019d be devastated if the lanes were removed, which allow me and my son to safely explore the city together.\n"

I will not be voting Conservative in this or the Federal election because I do not respect this initiative.\nRegardless of the fact all data points to bike lanes being a net positive for communities, this government is acting without wisdom, foresight or with an eye to the growing demands of cities in Ontario.\nThere simply are not enough parking spaces to hold all the cars we currently have, let alone add more to the city. Bike lanes, and all alternative modes of transit are the best solutions we have.\nSTOP BILL 212\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong support for the expansion and improvement of bike lanes in Toronto. As our city continues to grow, traffic congestion remains one of the most pressing issues we face. Investing in dedicated bike lanes is a critical step in addressing this problem. Removing bike lanes WILL ONLY INCREASE CAR TRAFFIC.\nPersonally, I bike and walk around the city on a regular basis because it is often faster and more efficient than driving. During peak hours, cycling allows me to avoid traffic jams and get to my destination quickly, while driving can result in long delays. By prioritizing bike infrastructure, we can make it easier for more people to choose sustainable modes of transportation\u2014helping to reduce the number of cars on the road, ease congestion, and improve air quality for all residents.\nBike lanes not only provide safer routes for cyclists but also contribute to a more livable and sustainable city. The success of bike lanes in other major cities shows that they are a smart, long-term investment that benefits everyone\u2014drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians alike.\nI urge you to continue supporting the expansion of bike infrastructure in Toronto as part of a comprehensive approach to reducing traffic and building a more sustainable, future-focused city.\n"

        "comment": "As a resident and taxpayer in Ontario, I'm appalled at the proposal to remove bike lanes in Toronto.\nIt's an egregious waste of public money to pay to rip out bike lanes that were recently installed - many  within the past five years. I live and drive in Toronto. The source of traffic and gridlock is not the bike lanes. I'm thankful that we have infrastructure that encourages people to ride their bikes *instead* of driving.\nAdditionally, I care about public safety. Bike lanes - especially separated bike lanes like those proposed for removal - provide a safe environment for Ontario residents to ride their bikes. When I ride my bike I specifically plan routes that include infrastructure like that on Bloor, Yonge and University.\nShame on the current Ontario government. If you're looking for a way to win votes prior to the next election, your efforts would be better spent elsewhere.\n"

        "comment": "This legislation will endanger cyclists and will result in deaths which the government will be directly responsible for.  It is grossly unfair to people who live in the area and cannot afford expensive cars to get around. The downtown Toronto area did not vote for the current Conservative provincial government in the last election and they therefore have no mandate or right to override the decisions of our local elected municipal government. It is estimated that removing these existing bike lanes will cost $48 million making this a poor investment as well as a poor decision all around. There is no evidence that this change (removing existing bike lanes) will improve gridlock at all and in fact will likely likely make it worse as now there will be substantial road construction required and more cars on the road afterwards. The idea to remove these existing bike lanes appears to be solely at the selfish whim of the Premier without any traffic studies or research to justify it (as was done by the city before it first install the lanes).....Only useless anecdotes. The minister of transportation quoted badly outdated 33 year old data from 1991 (saying that only 1.2% of Torontonians commute by bike) when trying to justify this absurd idea. It's obvious that this is a political wedge meant only to ensure the support of the passage of the bill by those who don't even live in the area. The local constituents should have greater say in the matter and the provincial government should stop meddling in municipal matters! This is an abuse of authority.\n"

Bike lanes improve mobility and accessibility for many citizens, from the young to the old, and businesses benefit from them too as People do shopping, not cars.\nThe Minister should be looking at improving public transit like delivering the Eglinton Crosstown as it is now pass its 14th year of construction with still no opening date in sight.\nif Ford and the minister wants to improve traffic east west across the city, OPEN THE DAMN CROSSTOWN.\nFord should start working on actually listening to the people on Ontario like fixing the healthcare system, instead of wasting taxpayer money on trying to build highways no one wants and interfering with cities that are trying to build a better more health and economic future.\n"
