Bike lanes are a more efficient, cheaper and healthier form of transport that should be promoted.\nIf you want to reduce gridlock you should take a look at reforming street parking and public transit initiatives.\nBuild more multi story parking lots to restore full lanes of traffic that are used for outdoor car storage on most roads.\nAlso the province should stop meddling in municipal affairs where most resident support bike lanes.\nI hope the city can stand up to and resist this measure and other policies of ford government.\n"

Taking that away only will create much more friction and coldness to a less accepting society. We need variety and be more open to other ways to get around minus just using cars that damage our climate and only make things cluttered. I think its more about redesigning our roads and creating systems that are multi-purposeful so that there is ease of flow and ease of use with no friction.\n"

The people of these communities voted for and pay for these bike lanes (commuters do not); they should have the say as to whether they stay, just as it always was.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose this proposal. There is no evidence from research on traffic and city planning that suggests reducing bike lanes will move more people faster. Indeed the opposite is true.\nToronto is quickly becoming a cycling city, which is good not only for reducing traffic (a bike takes up less space than a car), but also from a health standpoint (which is important given the healthcare cost savings of having a healthy public), and an environmental standpoint. By every metric, with perhaps the exception of drivers\u2019 satisfaction with street parking options, the bike lanes are a better use of space. Please stop this bill, and keep our bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "Dear Premier Ford,\nAs a tax-paying citizen of Toronto and Ontario, I am very concerned at the overstepping of the provincial government into the transportation needs of Toronto.  I know I can speak for many when I say that cycling in the city has increased, reducing the need for cars within the city and .  Bike lanes increase the safety, the wellbeing (mental and physical) of cyclists and all citizens - increasing cars does not.  Many people feel more safe to start commuting by bike because of the additional safety. The Ontario Traffic council and others state that the data does not validate comments that this is a solution for traffic congestion which seems to be a desired outcome.\nTaking away built lanes is a double-whammy for tax payers - putting them in and taking them out.  It doesn't matter if it is 7 million (per news from Queen's Park) or 48 Million (Per the City) - it is money that could and should be spent where we need it more. Education, underhoused, healthcare, etc etc.  Personally, it doesn't matter which level of government pays for it, it still comes out of our pockets unnecessarily.\nWhy is there a need to put peoples' lives at risk?  Even car drivers breathe the air they pollute.\nI appreciate your re-consideration and elimination of this proposal.\n"

Environmental assessments are there to protect us the people just as much as it is there to protect wildlife.\nSchedule 4 shows a complete lack of understanding of traffic patterns, or was put in there just to distract from the blatant abuse of power taking part in the rest of the bill. Both of these possibilities are embarrassing and disgraceful.\nThis bill is an attack on the people of this province and should be torn up immediately if you have any shred of decency or integrity.\n"

        "comment": "I support bike lanes.  Bikers use bike lanes to travel safely and affordably\nBike lanes do not cause traffic congestion, cars cause congestion.\nWithout bike lanes in my community, I would not feel safe biking to most destinations and would be forced to travel by personal vehicle, causing increased traffic, and producing more greenhouse gases.  Transit is currently not generally adequate to provide a reasonable alternative to cycling.\nThe selection of bike lane locations should be a municipal planning and transportation decision, not dictated by the province.  Science and factual analysis should be used to determine the value of the lanes, not anecdotes from drivers.\nRemoving existing bike lanes that have been shown to be well used and which support vibrant streets is not a good use of tax dollars.  Lower use bikes lanes that are an initial phase of a larger cycling network should also be left in place until the full network is constructed.\nI understand that emergency services have not raised concerns about facing difficulties due to bike lanes.\nI feel that making cycling less safe by removing bike lanes will lead to increased injury and death of cyclists. The life and safety of cyclists should be a higher priority than the (unsubstantiated) potential of cutting seconds off a commute by car. Bike lanes are a safe and valuable way to get around cities, we need more of them not fewer.\n"

        "comment": "I am strongly opposed to Bill 212, and in particular, the provisions requiring provincial approval of new bicycle lanes and removal of existing bike lanes on Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue, because:\n(1)\tIt represents an unwarranted intrusion onto municipal responsibilities\n(2)\tIt allows one person (the Minister) to over-ride decisions (the construction of the afore-mentioned bike lanes) that were the result of a long consultative process involving all stakeholders and professional planners\n(3)\tThe reasons given for these actions (to reduce traffic congestion) are invalid (it has long been demonstrated that increasing road capacity by adding or, in this case, restoring traffic lanes does not cause a significant long-term decrease in congestion because it simply attracts more drivers).\n(4)\tThe are other and better ways to address the reason given for removal bike lanes \u2013 such as better management of construction, better enforcement of illegal parking and turns, and improved rapid transit alternatives to driving.\n(5)\tTo the extent that there is an inconvenience for drivers, this has to be weighed against the benefits for cyclists (especially reduced risk of accidents and death!).\n(6)\tThe world, including Canada, is facing the prospect of catastrophic climatic change due to emissions of greenhouse gases, with many obvious warning signs (extreme heat and rain, droughts, and forest fires) associated with the small (1.2 C global mean) warming that has occurred already. This means that urgent action is required in every area to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and that means doing everything possible to encourage less use of cars and more use of alternatives \u2013 including cycling for short distances.\nIt light especially of global warming, the governments actions in Bill 212 are incredibly backward and contrary to the amazing actions to provide networks of interconnected and physically separate bike lanes in other cities around the world \u2013 Paris, France being perhaps the most prominent recent example. For its health and environmental benefits, the Government of Ontario should be doing whatever it can to encourage people to drive less and cycle (and walk) more, not making it harder and dangerous to choose the better alternative!\nIt light of the above, Bill 212 should be withdrawn.\n"
