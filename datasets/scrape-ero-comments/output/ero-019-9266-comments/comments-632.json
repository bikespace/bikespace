        "comment": "This policy is based on a complete lack of understanding of urban transportation. Making more room for cars does not reduce traffic, and this has been proven over and over again with study after study for decades. The only solution is better transit and more options like bike lanes, which take up way less space per person. Spending all that money to reverse progress is just pandering to an ignorant voter base who are largely car commuters.\n"

        "comment": "Please leave the present bike lanes intact and usable. Removing will cost so much money, time and traffic. When there is construction happening there is also always an increase of risk on pedestrians and cyclists. Being a pedestrian and cyclist should be a safe act in a wonderful place like Toronto, but if people are forced to feel most safe back in cars then our ability to live together will diminish.  Living downtown Toronto means learning how to be with other people; living in Toronto means not always being in your car. Being in a big city and constantly interacting and sharing space with others in bike lanes, on sidewalks and on transit is important for all people to continue to learn how to live together.  If the streets are made unsafe by unnecessary construction (removal of existing bike lanes) and more people driving in cars we all lose. It is essential for community, communication, civility and empathy to foster if we continue to support safe physical interaction. Please do not remove the bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "I am commenting on the section on Bill 212 that specifically deals with the approval and regulation of bike lanes.\nI understand the need to find a solution for increased congestion; however, I do not believe that taking out vital bike lanes, or forcing the constructing of bike lanes to be approved by Ministry before being developed will be beneficial for reducing gridlock.\nThe construction of bike lanes has proven to increases the amount of local cyclists in multiple communities across Ontario. The removal of the bike lanes will only increase congestion as the roads become less safe for cyclists who will have to resort back to driving. Bike lanes encourage biking, which not only reduces per capita emissions, but also reduces the amount of vehicles creating congestion. Ontario's population continues to grow, and continuing to design urban communities around personal vehicle use will only result in more congestion. Additionally there will be continuous road repairs and work needed to be done once more cars are using roads, which will be reflected in the amount that taxpayers will have to pay in the future. Instead of implementing laws that make it more difficult for municipalities to create sustainable cities, why not aid in the transformation away from car dependency? Finish through on the promise for more reliable public transit, a solution that will get more people of the streets during rush hour.\nI would also disagree that bike lanes have proven to be useless and have just been taking up road space.\nFor example, in Toronto's 2023 cycling recap, the report found that the implementation of bike lanes along multiple streets has increased cyclists. The report found that between 2020 and 2023 the number of rides through Bike Share has increased from 2.9 million to 5.7 million, and the yearly memberships purchased increased from 18,855 to 35, 555. While this is only an example of one city, the statistics show that commuting by bike has continuously increased over the past three years, and by forcing municipalities to obtain provincial approval before constructing bike lanes, will only make the process more difficult and slower, and discourage citizens from cycling.\n"

        "comment": "The bike lanes provide an excellent means for people who need to get around the city for work or pleasure on their bicycles safely. There needs to be more consultation and participation on where they are put in to prevent disruption to the others who use the roads.\n  One example is the proposed change to one lane going south on Parkside Drive. This is a main thoroughfare for traffic getting down to the lakeshore and destinations either east or west. The whole idea is totally wrong and will add to gridlock and a lot of frustrated drivers.  Bicyclists have many alternatives to get to the lake including through High Park , Windermere Avenue and Ellis Avenue.\n    The above proposal is ill conceived and will cause major disruption to the community at large.\n"

        "comment": "Hello\nI strongly object to Bill 212 - Framework for Bike Lanes as an approach to reduce traffic congestion and grid-lock and in particular the provision for the removal of bike lanes on Bloor Street, University Avenue and Yonge Street in Toronto.  The separation of bikes from vehicular traffic lanes actually facilitates to the efficient and orderly movement of cars, trucks and bikes.  If only vehicle lanes are available, bikes will use the vehicle lanes will slow down and impede cars and trucks.   The provision of bike lanes also encourages more people to bike safely as an alternative to driving.  This is clear when observing the large numbers of bikes in the existing lanes on these streets.   Imagine all those bikes mixed in with the cars and trucks.  To be clear I do not ride my bike in the city but I certainly support the provision of bike lanes for the benefit of all road users.\nI also do not support the Province reviewing and approving bike lanes.  This is clearly a municipal responsibility.  Duplication of government responsibilities is not an effective approach to address traffic congestion.\n"

        "comment": "The proposed legislation that restricts new bike lanes or even removes existing bike lanes is awful.\nBike lanes have made streets safer and commute easier by encouraging people to travel by bikes instead of cars. Over the past few years, I have noticed a drastic increase of cyclists and less speeding cars on roads where bike lanes are present. It is a much more convenient way to move around the city. Even as a pedestrian, I feel much safer as cars are less likely to speed on these streets. Studies from within Canada and other countries have shown that promoting cycling and public transportation while discouraging use of cars alleviate traffic congestion effectively. Blaming cyclists and bike lanes would just worsen the problem. (As a comparison, traffic on all HWYs in GTA have significantly worsen over the past decade, are bike lanes also the cause?) It's upsetting that the Ontario province is ignoring the scientific evidence and expert advices to favor drivers, while at the same time putting minimal efforts addressing car traffic violations such as speeding that threaten street safety.\nIt is even worse that this legislation, in essence, is a severe violation to local democracy by forcing rules onto municipalities. Municipal councilors are elected by voters to represent LOCAL residents' will on LOCAL affairs. Bill 212 is totally disrespectful of that process. Or put it more vividly, it's RAPE to residents' will.\nBased on the aforementioned, I urge the Ontario Government to reconsider this Bill.\n"

        "comment": "The Ontario Government\u2019s attempt to remove of bike lanes in Toronto is not conducive to solving the problems of gridlock in the City of Toronto. Large amounts of construction in the City, including the Ontario Line, the Gardiner Expressway, and the demolition of Ontario Place, alongside the underfunded TTC, now running unreliably, directly result in gridlock. Removal of bike lanes will not only fail to substantially address the gridlock in question, but may contribute to further gridlock if cyclists, who are unable to safely bike around the city, must resort to using cars instead.\n"

        "comment": "I live in the Bloor West area, and I completely agree with Mr. Ford. These bike lanes have dramatically increased traffic in the Bloor West area. Given that the cyclists constitute an extreme minority on Bloor Street, it is illogical that the traffic capacity of such a busy street would be halved in the interest of cyclists.\nFurthermore, the design of the bike lanes on Bloor is extremely dangerous for cyclists. When motorists wish to make a right hand turn, they are now required to cross a bike lane where cyclists emerge from the driver\u2019s blind spot at speeds often exceeding 40 km/h. This type of right hand turn is an extremely challenging manoeuvre that is dissimilar to any of the other manoeuvres that are typically expected of Ontario motorists. Even the most scrupulous and well-intentioned motorist would have difficulty executing this maneuver without endangering cyclists. This challenge is even greater in the context of bicycle lanes that are separated from motor vehicles by parked cars because the parked cars visually mask the bike lane, thus making it even more difficult for motorists to see cyclists while executing right hand turns.\nIn summary, Toronto\u2019s busiest streets should not be made busier in the interest of including bicycle lanes, especially when those bike lanes are designed in a manner that further endangers cyclists.\n"

        "comment": "Gridlock is a major problem in Ontario, however the solution to this problem is not building more roads. There have been many studies that have shown that adding extra lanes to roads in fact increases traffic over time. As a daily commuter on Bloor (sometimes by car and sometimes by bike), I am strongly opposed to Bill 212. The bike lanes on Bloor not only make it safer and easier for cyclists to commute, but they also make it easier for drivers as well. Cyclists can have their own space on the road, ensuring less conflicts with cars. The more people who can cycle safely to and from work, school and errands also has environmental and health benefits. Moreover, not allowing people to use accessible thoroughfares on bikes will push these commuters back into cars, further adding to the congestion. There is a hard limit on how many more cars we could possibly fit on the roads in Toronto, however, the scaling of bike lanes and public transit is exponential. If the focus of this bill was truly to reduce gridlock, the government would be focussing on expanding transit, adding more bike lanes and providing more accessible options for getting around that don\u2019t rely on our already overly congested roads. Bike lanes must remain on main arteries, as these are the most efficient routes for commuters, and secondary roads won\u2019t provide the same efficiency, thus forcing cyclists to use the main arteries regardless.\nI am also not in support of the fast-tracking of building highways, including the 413. There is no reason to not perform due diligence when spending billions of taxpayer dollars on a massive project that will have major impacts on the environment. All road projects that pass through protected land should be subject to environmental assessment to ensure that impacts are minimized, and this should not be accelerated under any circumstances.\nStop Bill 212.\n"

Please leave this matter to the municipalities.\nI live and work in downtown Toronto and I regularly get around the city by bicycle, using the bike lanes along University Avenue, York Street, Adelaide Street, Richmond Street, Blue Jays Way, Queens Quay and Sherbourne Street.  Not just for commuting to/from work but also for running errands, shopping, eating out and visiting friends.\nIf these protected bike lanes weren't there I'd do all of those things by car, ADDING another car onto the road and making congestion worse.\nThere is literally decades of research showing that adding more car lanes makes traffic worse, not better; it's called induced demand.\nHaving dedicated, safe cycle lanes makes cycling a viable alternative to driving, which is better for Ontarians' health and our environment.  Furthermore it's better for Ontarian businesses; it is easier and safer to spot a nice shop/restaurant on a bike at 15km/h, park the bike and go in, than it is to fly past the shop/restaurant in a car at 40km/h and be unable to find parking.\nThis legislation puts lives Ontarian lives at risk, goes against its stated aim of \"reducing gridlock\", makes it harder to patronize local shops/restaurants, and encourages more people into cars with all associated ill effects on health, air quality and climate.\nLiterally no other jurisdiction in the developed world is proposing to do something like this; not even in the car-centric USA.\n"

Evidence shows that returning these lanes to car traffic will have minimal impact on congestion - to do that, the city needs reliable public transportation infrastructure.\nMy teenage boys use bike lanes to travel all over the city - to their part-time jobs, to their leisure activities, to see friends. I never worry about their safety because of the excellent cycling infrastructure developed over the past decade.\nThere is practically zero enforcement of traffic violations in the city, drivers are more dangerous than ever and the TPS is useless. If my kids - or anyone\u2019s - are harmed by a driver because these lanes are removed, I hope this government accepts their culpability.\n"
