        "comment": "After we've had 6 cyclist deaths this past year, shouldnt we do something to work against that ( not for it?) I don't think this will improve gridlock like you think it will. Biking is one of the better ways to get places in toronto right now, but its far better when you can separate yourself from the vehicles that could crush you. With the TTC operating as shoddily as it is, people need OPTIONS. Infrastructure needs to be put in place to encourage folks for other options, as this many cars were never meant to be on the roads.\n"

        "comment": "I am strongly AGAINST removing existing bike lanes, or restricting the development of new bike lanes. I am deeply concerned about the direction Bill 212 is headed and oppose it for many reasons.\nIn Ontario, we need more active transportation corridors that are safe for users.  Key priorities of the government should focus on reducing GHG in the transportation sector to get us closer to our GHG emission targets, which is more effectively done by getting people out of their single driver vehicles and onto bikes, walking paths, or public transport.\nWe need MORE dedicated bike lanes in Toronto and other cities, to improve safety for cyclists. Too many deaths have occurred due to cyclists sharing the road with careless and reckless drivers. Data from jurisdictions worldwide shows that dedicated bike lanes significantly reduce the number and severity of collisions between cyclists and motor vehicles.\nResearch consistently demonstrates that well-designed cycling infrastructure not only enhances safety for cyclists but also improves overall traffic flow and reduces congestion in the long term (Toronto Centre for Active Transportation, 2018). Additionally, studies show that businesses in areas with protected bike lanes tend to see an increase in sales, driven by greater foot and bicycle traffic (New York City Department of Transportation, 2014). These facts contradict the government\u2019s claims that bike lanes negatively impact local businesses and inconvenience motorists.\nThe changing nature of work in large cities puts many workers on bikes: as couriers, food delivery drivers, and for workers who cannot afford other transportation options. Bike lanes offer a way for these workers to get to/from or to do their work safely.\nPutting hundreds of thousands of bikes in Toronto INTO the vehicle lanes will surely create more congestion, not less? It's just common sense. Where will all the cyclists go when bike lanes are removed? They won't be stopping their cycling, they will now be jamming up traffic amongst the vehicles on the road. As \"vehicles\" under Ontario's MVA, we have a right to be on the road and need somewhere safe to ride.\nTo roll back the progress we have made on safe cycling infrastructure is to undermine years of investment in road safety, environmental sustainability, and economic vibrancy.\nI urge the government to put the brakes on Bill 212 and focus on developing more active transportation infrastructure, not less.\n"

Cars will still be stuck on Bloor St.  Doug Ford will make life more dangerous for cyclists and pedestrians by prioritizing cars.  If he really wanted to reduce gridlock he\u2019d finish transit projects.  A congestion charge would be progressive but he\u2019ll never do that to car drivers.\nThe $200 bribe is 3 billion that could be used on transit.\n"

Every bike takes up 1/5th of the space of a car which usually only has 1 or 2 people in it. It also makes parking better when there are less cars, and it\u2019s better for the environment and health of the citizens. You should be encouraging this! More people will use bike lanes if they are there, and they are safe.\n"

If the province is looking to add space for drivers, then I would suggest eliminating street parking, especially on Bloor Street and other major roads where congestion is a problem.

        "comment": "Bike lanes help diversify urban  transportation options. I suggest we build an even larger network of safe bike lanes so that they will be a more viable option to city residents.\nRemoving bike lanes will only lead to more cars on the road and continued gridlock.\nFundamentally the city is not designed for cars.  Motorists should be dissuaded from driving in the city.  Alternatives like improved public transit, an elite, world enviable network of bike  lanes, improved commuter trains and beautified pedestrian sidewalks....promenades!...should be invested in.\nYou have to improve the alternatives.  Go trains need to run more often from more suburban areas.  TTC has to be cleaner and safer.  Bike lanes have to be separate from roads.  Metrolinx  will be great.\nCity driving should be limited to existing urban residents, emergency vehicles and \"working vehicles\".  I don't suggest this be policed, but I suggest it become part of the intentional language around urban driving.  Change the talk.\nParking should be removed from much of the downtown area. In this way people, other than existing urban residents,  will be forced to find another way to get into the city center.\nTraffic fines should be increased for illegal parking/stopping in the downtown core.\nThere will NEVER be enough room for cars in downtown Toronto.  The only way to ease congestion is to prevent cars from entering the core.\nDrivers need to realize that you just CANNOT drive downtown.  Stop trying.  It is delusional to think that the city roads can handle the volume of cars that \"want\" to drive downtown...bike lanes or no bike lanes.  It was never built to accomodate the level of cars that want to drive downtown...and it never will be!\nThe only solution is to do it differently.  Other cities have had to do this too.  There are effective models in place to follow.\nNew residential builds should not include parking.\n"

        "comment": "I don't think giving the province the ability to remove already existing bike lanes is necessary, nor a good idea. That seems like a municipal matter, and we should be able to trust that the municipal government will make the right decisions based on what the needs of the city are at that time.\nTraffic isn't the only consideration. Providing transportation options that are better for the environment or more affordable are also incredibly important and valuable things to consider for the overall wellbeing of our city.\nIt's also not clear to me how removing bike lanes would help traffic at all to begin with. If anything, we should add more bike lanes so that more people feel safe to bike more often, and there are less cars on the road. That seems like it could actually reduce traffic.\n"

I am sure many people have already sent you links showing that removing bike lanes does not help with traffic gridlock. Removing bike lanes is dangerous for human beings and it doesn't help with the traffic. You're literally putting vehicle importance ahead of human lives if you remove bike lanes so more vehicles can go on the streets. Cycling is much better for health, having less pollution from vehicles is much better for everyone's health. Premier Ford do your updated research and care about your constituents at least a bit.

Further, bike lanes create safety for cyclists, and unlike most vehicles, bikes do not release carbon into the air furthering the climate crisis. If the provincial government wishes to provide municipal governments with tools to reduce traffic congestion, it should enact laws permitting municipalities to impose road pricing, just as municipalities can impose transit pricing, and it should provide more funds to support public transit..\n"

        "comment": "Safety - cyclists deserve safety, and are statistically the most at risk of death - the lack of safe bike lanes is not only a constant threat, but a major reason which deters more people from choosing cycling for their trips, or even trying it.  Drivers also don't want the risk and anxiety of intermixing with cyclists.\nHealth - increasing activity for our population is critical to improving physical and mental health, reducing obesity and associated conditions and health care costs\nFairness - people who choose to cycle should have access to safe, efficient and continuous routes to connect to their destinations and public transit\nEffectiveness - removing a few bike lanes to add to the existing thousands of car lanes is unlikely to significantly improve the severe congestion problem which is complex and requires deeper thinking and larger solutions - look to examples such as the Netherlands which managed a societal transformation improving safety, health, congestion, happiness...rather than regressing to car-centric design which got us here in the first place.\nEfficiency - most cars are mostly empty, unnecessarily consuming energy and space which should be better-allocated.  Managing bike (and scooter) traffic smoothly enables cost-effective transport options for many.\nAvailability Bias - bike lanes are an easy (but not necessarily appropriate) target as they are constant and visible, whereas most lane obstructions are caused by vehicles inappropriately stopped or parked, and inefficient construction closures where work is not being expedited - targeting these issues will yield far greater effect and also allow for revenue generation.\nGive people the choice of safe, clean, effective and efficient cycling, walking and rapid transit options and these will be the choice for many more trips while reaping these benefits.  Delaying, avoiding or undoing such solutions has gotten us to this point - execute on overdue transit plans to push through to a better future.\n"

If reducing gridlock is the goal, the choices made for Bill 212 are nonsensical.\nBike lanes are known to reduce, rather than increase care traffic, freeing up car lanes for drivers rather than taking it up.\nBesides this, bike lanes are an essential piece of infrastructure for any city to function appropriately, and a financial asset alongside being traffic improvers.\nI personally use the three bike lanes proposed for removal on a daily basis, allowing me safe journeys where it would be a risk to my life to go otherwise.\nBill 212 is an affront on our province, and one that I will remember upon any election.\n"
