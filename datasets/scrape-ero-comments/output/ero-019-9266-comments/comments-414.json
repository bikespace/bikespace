        "comment": "I oppose Ontario Bill 212, the Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 202*, due to several significant concerns. The proposal to remove bike lanes as a strategy for reducing traffic congestion is fundamentally misguided and contradicted by evidence. Studies and historical data consistently show that removing bike lanes does not alleviate traffic congestion; in fact, it often worsens it. This measure will likely increase accidents and fatalities, leading to higher costs for the city in healthcare, emergency services, and legal expenses. Additionally, this is a scary overreach of provincial powers into municipal affairs.\nToronto\u2019s own data underscores this point. When bike lanes were removed from Jarvis Street in 2011, city records revealed that traffic actually slowed, with increased travel times\u2014directly contradicting the goal of reducing congestion. Eliminating bike lanes only serves to endanger cyclists and discourage sustainable transportation, fostering a higher dependence on cars and further contributing to gridlock.\nRather than adopting policies that risk lives and degrade urban infrastructure, the province should prioritize investments that truly benefit residents, such as strengthening healthcare and education. This would better serve the long-term interests of Ontarians than removing bike lanes to cater to drivers and suburban commuters.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 ignores evidence of the demand and benefits of cycling. It illustrates the government's short-term-ism and lack of vision. There is no business case to support vehicles over pedestrians and cycling.\nIt is irrefutable that cycling on safe bike lanes is a superior transit form. Studies show it is better for human fitness, reducing emissions, social connection, reducing noise, promoting tourism, reducing energy and maintenance costs, saving space and stimulating local business. Evidence is abundant. No debate. (see references below)\nHowever, the Premier proposes a solution that eliminates the best solution! It's not only fiscally irresponsible, but morally reckless. The cost exceeds the benefit of tearing them down. It's similar to Premier Harris' filling-in the dug tunnels of the Eglinton subway, only to dig them up again at a higher cost.\nWhy are cities like Paris, Copenhagen, Amsterdam, Montreal, Stockholm so far ahead of Ontario in cycling networks? Good policy. They are dominating for a reason: They discourage the use of vehicles.\nThe Premier's personal bias against cycling is another example of unsupportable decisions, or worse, deliberate misrepresentation of facts. The government is losing trust and its ideas belong to the 1950's. The world has progressed.\nSources:\nhttps://www.govtech.com/fs/study-more-bike-lanes-needed-to-reduce-traff\u2026\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214140523000877\nhttps://www.thetrillium.ca/news/municipalities-transit-and-infrastructu\u2026\nhttps://www.euronews.com/green/2024/04/12/cycling-is-now-more-popular-t\u2026\nhttps://www.cbc.ca/news/science/bike-lanes-impacts-1.7358319\nhttps://openknowledge.worldbank.org/entities/publication/be01e203-e60d-\u2026\nhttps://www.fundersnetwork.org/a-broader-vision-of-biking-lessons-from-\u2026\nhttps://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/9682-Road-to-Health_I\u2026\nhttps://www.wri.org/insights/invest-walking-cycling-sustainable-safe-ci\u2026\n"

        "comment": "Dedicated and protected bicycle lanes reduce car traffic congestion. they allow people who wish to cycle safely and quickly to do so, instead of being forced into their car to drive to the shops/school/work. it also moves cyclists off the road and into their own dedicated lane, ensuring cars arent being slowed down by cyclists. it also makes streets more accessible as people who cannot afford a car can still access a cheap mode of transport that can get them to most of their frequent destinations. cycling is also great for businesses, as someone on a bicycle may see a shop and decide to enter and purchase something, as it is much easier to park their bicycle than finding a parking spot for a car. businesses also need less space for bike parking than car parking, increasing the maximum number of customers that can access their business.\nthe reason there are few cyclists on the road is because the roads are not safe for cyclists. people do not cycle because they are scared of being hit by vehicles due to a lack of protection or seperation. if protected or seperated bike lane networks (key word 'networks', not just a handful of lanes) were built out, we would see a massive increase in cycling, and a massive decrease in vehicle congestion. it would make urban environments much more equitable and liveable.\nplease reconsider this bill.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes will not significantly reduce traffic. The bike lane on Bloor was analysed extensively when it was a pilot project and the total traffic delay was negligible. But removing it would negatively impact the environment, the culture of the city, and those who rely on the bike lane to travel. The bike lane is used extensively.\nFurther, having the province meddle in municipal affairs removes much of the accountability that is inherent in municipal politics. Why, if a city decides to replace a traffic lane with a bike lane, should the province have any say, rather than the voters in the city itself? It smacks of government over reach.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes do not cause congestion. To argue that bike lanes do cause congestion is like arguing that go transit causes congestion. It is a completely ridiculous argument to make especially considering the fact that go transit`s sole purpose was to alleviate traffic on Ontario`s highways. If the current cycling network was to disappear tomorrow traffic would definitely worsen, but that misses the point. For some people it may be the only way they can get around safely and affordably. It may be the only way they can make a living wage. It is also critical to remember that these corridors are streets. They are a complex environment where life in our city takes place. Streets like Bloor, Yonge and University are destinations not through-fares. The bike lanes make theses streets human scaled and a pleasant environment encouraging people to experience the street on foot shopping in the businesses adjacent to the street. With bike lanes; Bloor, Yonge and University are great and get the most value out of the space available. Ontario would commit suicide if it removes any of the current cycling network which is why bill 212 must not ever be passed by current or future governments.\n"

        "comment": "This is absolutely preposterous, elitist and unsafe. This government is taking the province backwards rather than improving accessible infrastructure and adding more of it. We don't need more highways for cars, we need MORE bike lanes and more transit options. Every road should have a bike lane and walking path, cars aren't the only mode of transportation. What a miss that clearly only caters to old white conservatives who only think about themselves and never those of future generations or those that are less fortunate and more vulnerable. You should all be ashamed of your policies and selfishness.\nWill never be voting for this government because it clearly only cares about a very small sliver of the population. It's clear no one in government has taken a look at how other nations who have bike infrastructure and traffic management figured out. All this administration is doing it making our roads more unsafe and inducing more traffic, congratulations. Every time I come back home from traveling I realize that we live in a parking lot centred around the car, rather than human-centred city design. Honestly makes me want to move out of this country and go to a more progressive nation.\n"

Removing bike lanes will simply result in more drivers on the road, leading to more congestion. As Toronto's population intensifies, it will simply not be possible to move everyone in cars, it is *necessary* for the population to use multi-modal transportation. Please take the money you would have spent administrating this proposal and put it toward improving other modes of transportation to get more drivers off the road and onto feet, bikes, and public transit.\n"

A bike lane can remove cars from the road by providing options and is much more space efficient thus money efficient, pavement is expensive!! I would much rather have bikes in their own lane instead of slowing down traffic and increasing congestion since their lane is removed and are forced to drive.\nI strongly suggest keeping bike lane options available without the red tape and restrictive bureaucracy and to provide transportation alternatives which free up space on the road for those who drive. More bikes means less cars, so despite there being one less car lane, cars end up having more space.\n"

For many people, especially those without the means or ability to drive, biking is a primary form of transportation. I myself relied on biking for a decade to get around for the majority of my trips as it was cheaper and often faster than public transit. For so many people, driving is simply not an option, and public transportation can often be encumbered by transfers and infrequent schedules. Bike lanes provide much-needed space and safety on the road. We need to provide solutions that support everyone's safe and timely travel, not just those with cars.\nIn addition, active transportation provides physical and mental health benefits and is an important step towards net-zero cities.  Prioritizing car over bike infrastructure is a step backwards.\n"

        "comment": "Earlier today I shared my reasons for opposing the province\u2019s proposal to remove by claims on Bloor Street,  Yong Street and University Avenue and to allow the province to determine where by clans would be located within the city of Toronto.\nIn particular, I shared a story of how I encountered a young mother and her five-year-old son biking down the bike lane on Adelaide Street this summer and how the bike Laine provided the safety necessary for her five-year-old son to get back-and-forth across downtown Toronto. I further shared that what she had informed me was that by being able to allow him to ride back-and-forth, saved her an hour each way rather than commuting on public transit.\nAfter sharing my concern and my position I hopped on my bike and I went to visit my in-laws in Bloor West Village. Along the way at the corner of Parkside Drive in Bloor, I encountered another young mother with her three kids all on bikes. I asked if I could take their photo which they permitted me to do.\nI\u2019m sharing the photo with you here because this is the reason that we need bike lanes in Toronto can you imagine this young mother with her nine-year-old daughter and her two sons in the carrier behind trying to cycle down any street where there weren\u2019t dedicated bike lanes.\nI then took my elderly in-laws out to Elora for lunch. It then took us three hours to drive back down the 401. Rest assured that the incredibly lengthy drive that we had coming back was not a consequence of any bike lanes in Toronto but rather because of the construction on the Gardner and various other construction taking place in and around the GTA.\nRespectfully, why doesn\u2019t the premier and the province stay in their lane and actually deal with the gridlock that is being created by the province itself. By that I\u2019m referring to the reconstruction of the Gardiner Expressway, the shutting down of Yonge and University at Queen Street for construction of the Ontario Line, and need I mention the Eglington LRT?  These are all projects that are in provincial jurisdiction that are currently causing far more gridlock in the city of Toronto than any bike lane on Bloor, Yonge, or University.\nFor the safety of the kids and young moms - those that can\u2019t afford a car and who have to rely on other means of getting around Toronto \u2014 stop making a political issue of bike lanes and provide them the safety and convenience they deserve.  And instead - the province should stay in its lane and deal with the projects in its jurisdiction that are truly shutting down traffic in the city of Toronto.\n"
