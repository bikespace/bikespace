        "comment": "The decision to \u201crip out\u201d bike lanes to accommodate more cars makes no sense at all when the problem is clearly too many cars on the roads. Trying to improve traffic flow for cars is a self fulfilling prophesy in that it will only encourage more people to drive their cars and worsen the problem of gridlock. The solution lies in improved and reliable public transit with new projects completed on a timely basis and allowing for more bike lanes - not less. A well established safe bike lane network will encourage more people to leave their cars behind and lead to a healthier population. The Ford government needs to look at the science and how other large cities are managing not just spur of the moment decisions that offer no real solutions.\n"

The amount of space required for urban sprawl and parking lots is taking away farm land and housing spaces. Bike lanes aren't the problem, our city designs and reliance on cars is the problem. Other countries with much larger populations have found solutions for this. We need better public transportation and less cars.\n"

The idea that MORE money would be spent to take out these lanes, because \u201cjust one more lane will solve traffic\u201d is delusional.

It has allowed me to reduce my reliance on a car, lower my GHG emissions, and arrive at work refreshed and having already done something good for my mental and physical help. Making it harder for municipalities put in protected bike lanes means fewer Ontarians will see these benefits.\nThe provincial government should stay out of municipal planning.

        "comment": "Bike lanes (including pre-existing bike lines, newly constructed bike lanes) are essential to a city's infrastructure and actually IMPROVE trafffic flow and gridlock. Bike lines are crucial for the safety of cyclists and drivers. Having safe bike lanes actually allow cyclists to ride through streets, not clog up traffic and not get into bike accidents with motor vehicles. The idea that Ford wants to rip up pre-existing bike lanes is ridiculous, unsafe and a waste of money. Surely from a financial aspect if not from anything else, Ford and his government should realize that it makes no sense to tear up already completed lanes.\n"

But this is not possible.\nTaking out the bike lanes will not make your infrequent commute to Queens Park any shorter. It will not speed up ambulance times; the opposite has been demonstrated. Taking out the lanes will have the same effect as when you ripped out the EV stations at great expense, only to spend millions putting them back in. Short-sighted, ill-thought out, illogical, knee jerk reactions are your specialty.\nIt is time to resign.\n"

        "comment": "Check out Belmont Ave in Kitchener. It is the perfect example to support this bill. I've lived on the street for 5 years and it was originally 4 lanes with two in either direction. The city decided to reduce the street to 1 lane in either direction with a centre turning lane and two bike lanes.\nThe issue is Belmont Avenues bike lanes sit empty all day because the street runs parallel to a very popular riding/walking trail (Iron horse trail). The trail and the street are approximately 50 meters apart. As a result of the lane reduction traffic backs ups several blocks daily and restricts movement even through intersections. The centre turning lane is also an issue as I've almost witnessed several head on collisions.\nDuring the winter months the bike lanes are plowed constantly and sit empty. Yet our roads are horrendous. It's an absolute joke.\nThank you for reading.\n"

Why won't the government listen to the facts around induced demand, the pressing need for mode shifting to have fewer cars on the roads, the dangers cyclists face under current conditions, and above all, the need for municipalities to decide what's best for their own cities? The idea that the province would actually pay to rip up existing city infrastructure, upon which cyclists increasingly rely, is especially galling. This is a terrible idea and should be abandoned.\n"

        "comment": "I agree with the intent of Bill 212. In my area (Kitchener-Waterloo) bicycle lanes have been in place for years and go largely unused, even in warm spring and summer months and even in areas that should attract large numbers of riders (around the universities and schools.) They have been place for years and the public has spoken through non-use: They are an answer to a question only a very small cycling lobby group and activist regional and city council and staff asked.\nI support implementing multi-use walking and cycling paths through parks and \"hydro cuts\" etc, modifying existing sidewalks into multi-use pathways and implementing cycling lanes in downtown cores where they might actually be used and where vehicular traffic volume is low; that is, where such lanes make sense.\nI do not support carving bicycle lanes out of major city traffic arteries, especially when it has been demonstrated that such lanes do not get people out of cars and which thus contribute to the problem of traffic snarls by reducing lane bandwidth.\nThank you for this bill. I look forward to its passage.\n"

        "comment": "The entire premise of this piece of legislation is backwards, and will hinder Ontario's development. As a global society, we have no choice but to build alternatives to automotive travel. There's no other way to put it. The resources required for individual car travel are completely unsustainable, from fuel, to manufacturing materials, to road maintenance. The sedentary, resource-intensive lifestyle that cars facilitate is bad for people, and impossible to continue to reproduce on our finite planet.\nAs a society, we WILL move beyond the automobile - it is inevitable and out of our control. What is in our control is whether we will have alternatives when this transition occurs. Building new highways and blocking construction of active transportation infrastructure is unconscionably stupid in 2024.\nIf we build safe infrastructure for people to get around on foot, on public transit, and by bicycle, people will use it. But we must build it first. This should be our #1 priority and guiding principle.\nOverruling municipal authority is also antidemocratic and extremely cringe. Ford needs to get a life and realize it's 2024.\n"

        "comment": "Reducing grid lock can only be achieved by reducing the number of cars on the street. This is accomplished by encouraging alternative means of transportation: buses, trains, bikes.\nThis bill will accomplish the precise opposite of this by encouraging more people to use space inefficient forms of transportation: usually a large car with a single person inside.\nThe city of Kitchener found that the \u201c development of the downtown cycling grid has resulted in a 164 percent increase in ridership, with 54,781 cycling trips in the first seven months of 2023\u201d. Each of these represent fewer cars on the streets.\nA study linked below shows how improving bike lanes and routes encourages other means of transportation, and make traffic overall safer.\nA CBC piece linked below shows how bike lanes actually reduce congestion by reducing the number of cars on the streets.\nPlease reconsider the actual impacts a bill like this would have in our traffic.\n"

The fact that a provincial government in the year 2024 is pandering to a subset of ill-informed voters by pushing legislation like this that would move our society backwards is sickening. Put the tax revenues into projects that will provide benefits for the citizens that pay them - not take those benefits away.\nBikes don't cause gridlock in cities; cars do. Bikes alleviate gridlock when the proper infrastructure is implemented. Any sane city planner or policy maker, or adult human with an ounce of critical thinking ability could tell you that. Discouraging and removing bike lanes will only put cyclists in further danger, and the blood those future injuries deaths is on your hands if you proceed with this legislation.\nThis is our lives and our futures that you're playing with. Quit using them as fodder for your cynical political gaming to rile up your base of supporters who, by and large, live far enough from any city to have never been remotely inconvenienced by a bike lane.\n"

But without proper bike lanes to separate us from cars, we are at risk of being hit. Off road trails are great and we need more of these but that is not as feasible downtown. People who commute via bikes need and deserve to be safe. They are no different than car commuters who just want to get to work fast and take the most direct route. Congestion is caused by cars, so replacing cars with more bikes reduces congestion on the roads. We need to build communities that support walking and biking, not just city higheays for regional commuters. Cars are Coffins!\n"

For many of those years I was taking my life in my hands. I\u2019ve been cut off, knocked over, very nearly hit. Then the lanes were introduced, and I watched a steady increase of cyclists join me and not a single near accident after that.

        "comment": "Over-ruling the rights of cities to build bike lanes is an offensive over-reach of provincial power.  Demanding cities rip out existing bike lanes is doubly offensive.  Who is paying for the cost of tearing out this infrastructure?\nThe more people we can get onto public transit, and on alternate modes of transport like cycling and even walking, the fewer cars we will have on the road.  It is bizarre to see there is nothing in a bill dedicated to 'reducing gridlock' about increasing transit funding, or assessing new bus or train routes, or even expediting the completion of existing transit projects like the Eglinton Crosstown or the Hurontario LRT.  And it is strange to see no consideration of whether street parking on arterial roads is itself a greater waste of road space than even a dedicated and built-out bicycle lane.\nThe more construction projects we have dragged out over months and even years, the faster we can regain existing road capacity to get traffic moving.  But environmental assessments for any construction in the province or elsewhere is crucial, and need to be completed before any shovel goes into the ground.  Shortcutting the study process is a terrible idea.\nWhile I am a driver and appreciate discussion about freeing up road space, I also have to acknowledge that the problem is the traffic itself, not the road space.  Get me off the road with a bike lane, or an LRT, and I won't be part of the problem.\nOverall this bill repesents incredibly backwards thinking on the government's part.  Build better, build properly.  Study, consult, plan, and THEN build.  And stop thinking of the car as the one hammer that can be used to drive in this particular nail.\n"
