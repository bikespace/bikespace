        "comment": "The primary problem causing congestion on Toronto streets is construction. Removing bike lanes on major streets will of necessity create new construction sites on those streets. Construction projects in Toronto, especially those involving collaboration with the province, frequently take much longer than expected (as well as costing much more than expected). It seems very obvious that removing bike lanes will only make traffic on those streets much worse in the short term, and actual studies of induced demand in traffic congestion indicate that it will have no effect whatsoever in the long term.\nI am firmly opposed to my tax dollars being spent on useless roadwork to remove existing bike lanes. I also do not think the provincial government has any reason to be involved in municipal decisions regarding the placement of new bike lanes, especially if this is an example of its decision making.\n"

Perhaps if the test to acquire a license was actually anything but cash grab people would have better understanding and being a pedestrian or cyclist would not require special lane in order to be safe.\nQuit perpetuating old ways of doing things.\nThe routes you're removing bike lanes from are fully accessible for public transportation.\nThanks again for considering only one point of view.\n"

        "comment": "Good grief, this is a completely unserious bill. Our transportation minister and premier need to take a basic transportation planning class. If everyone is forced to drive around in cars, congestion will be WORSE. Cycling provides benefits to mental and physical heath, reduces greenhouse gasses, takes up less space,\ndon\u2019t cost an arm and a leg to own and operate and most importantly ISNT LIFE THREATENING TO EVERYONE INVOLVED. Cars represent the biggest human-made cause of death in Canada. When people inevitably die on these routes, blood will be on the hands of Doug and Prabmeet. The way of the future is LESS PEOPLE IN CARS, whether the conservatives like it or not. The people of Ontario won\u2019t stand for this and will vote these clowns out.\n"

        "comment": "Your decision to remove bike lanes will make it even more dangerous to cycle here in Toronto than it is now. I use the bike path on Bloor almost daily. Even with this bike path I have been involved in numerous close calls involving  dooring incidents, being cut off and aggressive drivers. What you don't get is that the problem isn't you need more car lanes. The city of Toronto and the Province  of Ontario are making increased population density a priority. We have a large number of condo/apartment building projects being built or will soon be built in the West end. You can have 3 lanes of traffic both ways on Bloor and IT WILL NOT STOP GRIDLOCK!!!  One answer is to make safe purpose built infrastructure to support cycling in this city. If you build it the right way people will use it, and if you build it the right way car drivers will support it. Have you seen the Ghost bikes around the city? They represent people that have died on the roads of Toronto cycling. The first death on a reclaimed bike path road will be on YOU and your government. Do yourself a favour and go down to the Martin Goodman trail and look at the number of cyclists that use it. Say goodbye to those votes, I know I will be showing my objection to this move by making sure I never vote for Doug Ford and my PC  member Christine Holgarth again.\n"

        "comment": "I live near the Yonge St bike lanes.  When these were installed,  there was public meeting where the proposal was outlined --the work the city planners had done in making the proposal  was extensive.   They looked at traffic patterns on parallel  streets---Avenue Road and Mount Pleasant.   They considered times for emergency vehicles,  they provided for  parking so that the stores along Yonge from Bloor to Heath could get shoppers back to the area.  They also provided for some Cafe Toronto areas.  It was researched carefully and explained to people in the area.   They had a trial for about year and a half  and then made them permanent.    We are a neighbourhood and we enjoy our bike paths the way they are working.  We don't want traffic racing through our neighbourhood (what Doug Ford calls congestion )  People wanting to go north south  \"quickly\"  can do so on the two other major arteries or better yet by subway.   There are many walkers on Yonge Street and the four lanes is a safety concern especially for seniors in the area.   For Doug Ford to just high handedly say they must go based on his \"gut\" goes against the careful planning done when these were installed .  It  is an abuse of power . We want our city departments making decisions not Ford and his departments.   They should be fixing health care, education,  long term care and leave our city alone. (stay in YOUR lane)  We elect our city leaders to manage our city---let them.   Yonge street has  the subway so nobody has to drive downtown . Why feed the congestion further south?   What are all these cars going to do once they get to Bloor----add to the congestion further south.    The message should be take the subway , walk, or bike.   You can walk from Davisville to Bloor in half an hour.  You can bike downtown quickly. How are we going to meet our environment targets when we keep catering to the car at the expense of alternatives and neighbourhoods.  Great cities have figured this out.  Going back  is the wrong message especially when it is based on  \"fixing\"  congestion when there is no proof of this---just a political \"gut\"  over reaction.   We need to pay attention to people that studied this carefully and made a decision based on that research not on someone who thinks this is politically popular . It is  not.\n"

Bike lanes coverage should be expanded, not reduced, and we should be focusing on public transit infrastructure and culture that means less cars on the road, and more mobility across economic divides. And, factually, expanding lanes doesn't reduce traffic congestion, so it's not even smart, financially or sociologically.\n"

In Toronto, for example, I've seen many bicyclers weave in and out of traffic; many time they've almost caused accidents. Furthermore, any potential accidents will cause more money to be spent in the healthcare and insurance industries and people who use bicycles don't even pay any insurance. Having bicycle lanes downtown will only cause more gridlock and more accidents. Something we clearly don't need in Canada.\n"

These roads have historically always suffered from poor traffic unrelated to the cycling infrastructure. The separate lanes keep cyclists safe and prevent mingling with car traffic that will likely cause worse congestion than if they didn't exist.\nIt's also a poor use of tax payer dollars. Some of the lanes were recently completed and to remove them now is poor planning on the Provinces part. They've also been shown to help small business's along these routes.\n"

        "comment": "I am against Ontario Bill 212 (Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024) for several critical reasons. The proposal to remove bike lanes as a means of reducing traffic congestion is fundamentally flawed and unsupported by evidence. In fact, removing bike lanes will not reduce traffic; studies and historical data have shown the opposite. This measure will likely lead to more accidents and fatalities, ultimately costing the city more in healthcare, emergency services, and legal expenses.\nHistorical data from Toronto highlights this issue clearly. When bike lanes were removed from Jarvis Street in 2011, the city\u2019s own data indicated that travel times increased and traffic slowed, contradicting the intended outcome of easing congestion. Removing bike lanes only serves to endanger cyclists and deter sustainable transportation options, leading to higher reliance on cars and exacerbating gridlock.\nInstead of pursuing policies that endanger lives and diminish the quality of urban infrastructure, the province should focus on investments that directly benefit residents, such as enhancing healthcare and education. This approach would serve the long-term interests of Ontarians far better than dismantling bike lanes to placate drivers and suburban commuters.\nIn summary, Bill 212 is a step backward for Toronto and the province as a whole. Sustainable urban planning should prioritize multimodal transportation solutions that promote safety, efficiency, and environmental responsibility. The government\u2019s focus should be on creating a livable, accessible city for everyone, not just accommodating those who drive into the city for work.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is misguided in so many ways I can't possibly cover everything. As a resident of Toronto, I'm dismayed by the implications of this bill.\nProbably the most egregious is the ability of the provincial government to unilaterally remove or cancel municipal bike lanes. The statistic they're using in statements, that only 1.2% of Toronto residents bike to work, is wildly outdated - so much so that it predates most of Toronto's bike infrastructure. It also counts all residents of the GTA, stretching far beyond the reach of safe cycling infrastructure as it exists. Use of this statistic to justify this move is intentionally misleading.\nI bike recreationally around the city. I also own a car. Every time I ride my bike in a bike lane, I represent one less car on the road. When bikes don't have designated lanes, they're entitled to occupy an entire lane of traffic for their own safety. I fail to see how adding slow bikes to traffic lanes is supposed to reduce gridlock.\nThere are other failings in this absurd bill. The wanton destruction of important watersheds to build a new highway will result in disaster for the city, besides the ecological toll it will take.\nThis bill will cost taxpayers untold millions of dollars. I will donate my $200 OCP bribe to causes that oppose this government. I've had enough.\n"

It is ridiculous.\nThe government should be focusing on delivering the transit they have promised for a decade and expanding the existing transit to alleviate traffic.\nSpending provincial funds to endanger the lives of bikers so that traffic might get better is a gross use of taxpayer money.\n"
