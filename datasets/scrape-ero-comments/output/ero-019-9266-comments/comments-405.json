        "comment": "I am opposed to this bill for the following reasons:\n- If a city decides that cycling infrastructure serves its goals than philosophically I think the province has no business interfering. It is micromanagement; should the province also decide how parking should work or what the late fees at the library should be? Ridiculous.\n- Removal of existing bike lanes would mean:\n    - Spending public money to remove infrastructure paid for by public money. This is wasteful.\n    - For those who will cycle regardless of infrastructure, this intervention will make their journeys more dangerous. This is immoral.\n- When I'm stuck in traffic I'm stuck behind other cars not bicycles. Adding a car lane back to a handful of streets will make no appreciable difference; the 401 is huge and that thing's always packed. If the goal is to reduce traffic than taking steps to reduce the number of cars on the road is a better solution. Removing bike lanes might actually make traffic worse if cyclists are converted to drivers because they feel their route is now too unsafe to cycle.\n- There are good reasons to make commuting by bicycle safe in and of itself\n    - Physical activity is good for you. Healthier people tend to not only be happier, but require less healthcare leading to indirect savings for the province.\n    - It is far cheaper than commuting by car, even if the commuter still owns a car. No gas, no parking, & reduced insurance/maintenance/depreciation.\n    - Less driving means less CO2 emitted. Therefore cycling aligns well with the goal of reducing emissions.\n    - Bicycles do not create noise pollution like cars. Remember how quiet the early days of COVID were?\n    - It is safer for pedestrians because cars travel faster, have worse visibility, and are much heavier. How many pedestrians are killed by cars in a year? How many by bicycles?\nThat's everything that comes to mind at the moment, if you're still reading this thanks!\n"

        "comment": "The provincial government should not be meddling in municipal affairs, there is no evidence that white lanes increase congestion of car traffic. Much the opposite, more people biking is less people on the road driving, so people who actually need to drive can get to where they need to go quicker, which includes first responders. This also does not take into account the safety aspect of the bike infrastructure, in a time when there's an increasing amount of deaths of people cycling. As a driver, I feel less comfortable with cyclists weaving between me and other cars on the streets without proper bike infrastructure.\n"

        "comment": "Almost all cyclists also drive cars or take taxis or public transport. Dedicated bike lanes make it more likely that people will feel safe enough to ride bikes instead of driving cars. Too many cars on the road are what causes traffic congestion, not bikes. And people who do prefer to drive motor vehicles probably don't want to kill or maim cyclists or pedestrians. So everyone should slow down. Or take a train. All cities want to enable people to get around without causing stress and suffering and it's not for the provincial government to force them to backtrack on real progress.\nPlease don't pass this bill.\nPlease don't rip out any bike lanes.\nWe need more places where it is safe to walk and ride and breathe, not more room for more cars, which many people in this province cannot afford.\n"

Additionally, prioritizing alternate modes of transportation can reduce carbon emissions in our cities making the air cleaner and contributing to net zero carbon goals.\nRemoving bike lanes and prioritizing car-centric infrastructure is extremely short-sighted, and will be a detriment to our city, our environment, and our health.\nI have attached more links to my comment in support of my stance.\n"

        "comment": "Hi,\nI am a business owner based in the Vaughan\u2014Woodbridge riding and I am deeply concerned about this bill. I am a massive supporter of public transportation and bike lanes are a critical part of our public transportation infrastructure.\nWhen I visit downtown, bike and subways are the only practical way to get around. I use the Bloor, University and Yonge bike lanes quite often and have greatly appreciated the slow but steady improvements to the safety of these bike lanes over the last few years. This bill would completely turn back the clock.\nThe only way to reduce traffic in the long term, especially in growing urban areas, is by improving public and bike infrastructure. There simply isn't enough space to build enough roads to support the growing Toronto population. I don't want to imagine how much worse traffic in the GTA will get if we were to pull back on supporting this essential infrastructure.\nIt is also quite concerning to me that the Provincial government is introducing additional bureaucracy to slow down local governments ability to address local issues. I had been impressed by the Ford's government Healthcare and Education policies and had every intention to continue supporting them in upcoming elections, but if this bill were to pass, I'm not so sure.\nThank you for your consideration.\n"

        "comment": "I'm a driver. I don't like gridlock but I also like bike lanes that separate them from me. I don't really want to get into an accident where I run them down because they have to weave in and out of traffic and parked cars.\nI find the suggestion that removing bike lanes will improve traffic flow highly misleading and I don't think that my convenience should also endanger the lives of cyclists and pedestrians which by removing bike lanes without building anything as alternatives would ultimately result.\nFrankly, with the number of bad drivers out there I think more resources need to be committed to driver testing/retraining/recertification & enforcement. Bike lane removal does nothing for making people more responsible as drivers and making the public space a safer environment.\nI've had the privilege of travelling to other cities around the world like Seoul, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Tokyo and the one thing that makes them memorable from a transportation standpoint is great public transportation and emphasis on safety as a pedestrian and cyclist with spaces engineered to make things safe from motorists and strong legal measures to govern drivers and the mitigation of bad behaviors leading to a sense of entitlement.\nWe need more bike lanes and sidewalks for the city space to be inviting for us to dwell and spend time in rather than just getting from A to B. Spending money in cafe's and businesses is far more enticing when they are not simply located next to a highway. I don't for one enjoy sitting OR walking OR biking next to a highway.\nFix gridlock by investing in transit (trains, light-rail, buses) + biking and walking.\n"

        "comment": "Please reconsider. MORE bike lanes and bike infrastructure is what will reduce traffic in our city, not taking them away. I have been biking around Toronto since 2020 (I bought a bike in order to avoid taking TTC during the COVID pandemic) and have increased my usage every year since then. This past summer I rode my bike more than I ever have before and it was a great way to get extra exercise, get places more easily (I hate having to find parking when I drive into downtown or to friends places in the West end) and was so happy to have safe and accessible routes to get me where I needed to go. Removing bike lanes and refusing to build more means I will be less likely to bike as I won\u2019t feel safe to do so. This is an EXTRA CAR ON THE ROAD when there is no need for that! Please keep our bike lanes, peoples lives depend on it!\n"

In at least one case in Toronto, removing bike lanes actually INCREASED car travel times. The proposed move would make traffic worse, but cyclists at risk, and cost unecessary tax payer money. On top of that, climate change has become a very immediate and terrifying threat. Why would we push for more car usage and traffic, instead of focusing on better cycling and public transit infrastructure?\n"

Numerous times before the lanes were put in, I was almost knocked into traffic by parked vehicles opening their doors on me. The new intersections make it much safer to cycle along these routes!

Many of us in this city use multiple forms of transportation and we make choices about which based on what is efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally conscious.

I can guarantee there are people who would happily bike to work or school that don\u2019t do it because the infrastructure to keep cyclists safe is still in its infancy.

        "comment": "Toronto should prioritize the maintenance of its existing bike lanes for several compelling reasons. First, these lanes promote cycling as a safe and viable mode of transportation, encouraging more residents to choose biking over driving. This shift not only helps reduce traffic congestion but also lowers greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to the city\u2019s sustainability goals.\nMoreover, bike lanes enhance public health by promoting physical activity and reducing air pollution. When more people cycle, there is a corresponding decrease in respiratory issues and other health problems linked to vehicle emissions. Additionally, the presence of dedicated bike infrastructure can lead to increased local business activity, as cyclists are more likely to stop and shop in their neighborhoods.\nFinally, maintaining bike lanes fosters inclusivity in transportation planning. They provide essential connectivity for those who may not have access to a car, ensuring that all Torontonians can navigate the city effectively and safely. Keeping these bike lanes intact supports a holistic approach to urban mobility, benefiting the environment, public health, and the local economy.\n"

Bike lanes are reducing congestion, improving people's physical and mental health and helping create a vibrant city. The plan should be to create more Bike lanes and invest in public transit. Time to get inspired by cities who are doing a great job like Copenhagen. This proposal wastes taxpayers dollars and wipes out crucial investment that has already gone into vital city infrastructure. I use Bike lanes, and I walk in the city, drive a car and take public transit. Riding my bike is by far my favorite way to get around the city.\n"

        "comment": "For the following reasons, I would like to propose this exception to the requirement for approval.\n\"Where a highway/road has or will have two or more lanes of traffic and an unprotected bike lane, or at least three lanes of traffic and a a protected bike lane, and it is not a major highway, the highway/road is exempt from all approval requirements under this act in regards to the bike lane.\"\nThe Ontario Onwards: Action Plan posted by the Ontario Government highlights such goals as 'reducing red tape' and 'undertaking a review to find ways to simplify the process (of Development and construction approvals)'.\nThe 'Reducing Gridlock' bill serves exclusively to create additional red tape for cities - the province has already delegated responsibility for city development to municipalities, it is counterproductive to the government's stated goals to create a system whereby cities must obtain approval for development.\nThe Ontario government has no special expertise about bike lanes, and no legitimate interest in limiting bike lanes except in relation to inter-city highways, and roads that lead on or off said highways.\nGridlock, generally, is caused by driving errors at intersections, and the cars on a road exceeding the throughput of the intersection.\nBicycle lanes serve to reduce the car load on a road, and provide a place for a vehicle that must stop (for example, if involved in a collision) to pull over to without blocking a traffic lane.\nWhile some bicycle lanes require the removal of a traffic lane, many do not, and those that do often form key components of a 'bicycle lane network' - a series of bicycle lane that make it possible to safely travel from one area to another. The bike lanes that could be removed or denied under this act would cripple existing bicycle infrastructure by creating or leaving large gaps in bicycle networks.\nWhile a second lane of traffic allows faster traffic to pass slow traffic, a third lane is often of significantly less benefit. A third lane of traffic necessitates more complicated intersections, dedicated turning cycles, and provides substantially less benefit than the first or second lanes.\nBicycles have significantly less environmental impact than cars do. The environment is a significant concern to many Ontarians.\nCommuting via bicycle is a healthy activity. 30% of Ontarians are obese, and the overloading of Ontario's health services is a significant concern to many Ontarians.\nThe current Ontario administration has experienced significant scrutiny and backlash for its tendency to micro-manage municipal affairs. While the Ontario government is able to do so from a legal standpoint, acts like this are not popular with voters, because the public perception is that the Ontario government should leave city affairs to municipal administrations.\n"

        "comment": "As a driver who commutes in and out of downtown Toronto every weekday, I find the proposal to remove bike lanes on Bloor, University and Yonge to be an unacceptable and utterly wasteful use of government resources. We have already dealt with enough disruptive, poorly managed construction projects on our crucial arteries. There might be a chance it will slightly improve traffic flow, but there is a guarantee there will be more slowdowns, detours and frustration for the foreseeable future.\nI am also skeptical that these promised traffic improvements will ever materialize. Unprotected turns onto side streets will remain a problem thanks to Toronto's broken street grid. Look at Dundas and Queen, or Bathurst and Dufferin. No bike lanes, yet still horrible traffic because of lanes taken up by drivers waiting to make left turns. And if anything should be looked at, it's street parking permissions on every arterial, as a parking lane takes up more space and creates more conflict points than most bike lanes. (This also wouldn't require ANY construction spending.)\nFilling in the Eglinton subway tunnel in 1995 set this province back years and cost taxpayers untold sums of money. It remains one of the biggest stains on Mike Harris's legacy. Tearing up the bike lanes on these corridors promises to echo that infamous decision. Worse yet, it is such a clearly controversial plan that protests will undoubtedly erupt in the downtown core. Cyclists who are legally permitted to share the lane with cars will do everything in their power to prove their point. I know I'm not looking forward to it, and neither are my fellow commuters just trying to drive home. We've dealt with enough protests and construction this year already.\nDoes the Ford government want to be remembered for putting exciting new infrastructure plans forward, or does it want to waste time and money sloppily undoing completed projects? Regardless of the intent behind these plans, there is only one path I see coming from them. It is a path of frivolous spending, frustrating construction and public unpopularity.\n"
