With more people on bikes there will be less cars and then our goods movement can be better.\nBuild less highways, more bike lanes and more transit. This is proven in every other country in the world to work. It is working here but it will take more bravery on behalf of the government and I have faith they will step up and stop this bill.

They are hazardous to pedestrians and cyclists.\n"

        "comment": "Impact on Traffic Flow and Vehicle Speeds\nIf bike lanes are removed or restricted, bicycles will be forced to mix with motor vehicle traffic, occupying lanes previously dedicated to vehicles. This could inadvertently reduce overall vehicle speeds and increase congestion, as slower-moving bicycles would share space with cars and trucks. Rather than improving traffic flow, the absence of designated bike lanes may lead to greater delays and less efficient road use. To avoid these unintended consequences, the proposal should consider how bike lanes help manage traffic flow by creating safer, designated spaces for cyclists, thereby reducing disruptions in auto lanes.\nThe potential impact on vehicle speeds and traffic flow from mixing cyclists with vehicles suggests a need for a more comprehensive review of the proposal before it is passed as legislation.\n"

        "comment": "The provincial government shouldn't be adding red tape and bureaucracy to slow down local governments trying to increase transportation options. I use bike lanes everyday and consider them essential transportation infrastructure like sidewalks.\nWe need to think about guaranteeing safety and providing options for vulnerable road users instead of just maximizing the number of cars on the road, because more people would consider biking if it was a safer option which in turn would reduce car traffic. The data that's being used to evaluate the popularity of cycling is being taken out of context given that most cycling networks are under development and incomplete, which does not provide a safe trip for the average cyclist. Food delivery drivers in the denser population areas of Ontario will continue to cycle regardless of the existence of bike paths... do we really consider their safety less important than saving on our travel times?\nWhen I do drive I would much rather cyclists be out of my way in their own bike lanes. Bike lanes even support transit investments by making it easier to get to stations to increase the number of paying transit users.\nThis bill seems like a major step in the wrong direction for Ontario residents.\n"

        "comment": "This act is meant to reduce gridlock and save time by provincially defining where bike lanes can and can not be installed.\nThe provincial government should not be adding red tape and bureaucracy to slow down local governments trying to increase safe, and viable transportation options.\nThe best way to reduce gridlock and save car commuter's time is to reduce the amount of cars on the road. Let cities decide what they need and want. Give people viable alternatives to travel.\nThe act also allows the provincial government to remove bike lanes that have removed car traffic lanes when they were installed. You will be ripping out bike lanes that cities have spent millions installing to increase the traffic lanes by 1/2. Great, now you'll waste millions of provincial money to remove these bike lanes and have 2 lanes of bumper to bumper traffic instead.\nI use bike lanes when I commute to work and I consider them essential transportation infrastructure like sidewalks. I use them because I feel safe and because I don't want to be stuck in traffic.\nWe need to prioritize and guarantee basic safety standards and provide options for vulnerable road users, instead of just maximizing the number of cars on the road.\nWhen I do choose to drive, I would rather cyclists be out of the way in their own separate lane.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my opposition to Ontario Bill 212, a proposal that introduces substantial issues across its provisions for bike lanes and highways. This bill, if passed, would have unintended consequences that impact residents and the environment negatively.\nIncreased Red Tape: Bill 212 introduces unnecessary regulatory hurdles that complicate urban planning and infrastructure projects, particularly regarding bike lanes and highway improvements. Rather than streamlining processes for building safe and efficient transportation routes, the bill burdens municipalities and contractors with excessive compliance requirements. This red tape slows progress, increases costs, and hampers the adaptability of cities to evolve their infrastructure to meet residents' needs.\nEnvironmental Impact: The environmental implications of Bill 212 are concerning. This legislation threatens Ontario\u2019s climate goals by impeding the development of bike lanes, which are an essential part of reducing vehicle emissions. By restricting these sustainable transport options, the bill pushes people back to cars, worsening air pollution, congestion, and greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover, additional regulatory requirements for highways could lead to increased construction times and resource use, further harming the environment.\nRestriction of Choice: By limiting the options for alternative transportation, the bill restricts the freedom of Ontario residents to choose eco-friendly and health-conscious modes of travel, such as cycling. This is a step backward for public health and urban mobility, as it limits accessible and sustainable transportation options that have become crucial for many Ontarians, especially in urban centers.\nSerious Safety Concerns: Finally, Bill 212\u2019s restrictions on bike lane expansion raise significant safety concerns. Without sufficient infrastructure for cyclists, there is an increased risk of accidents and conflicts with motor vehicles. For highways, the additional regulatory constraints on development and maintenance may lead to delays in crucial safety upgrades, endangering drivers and commuters. Safety should be a priority, and this bill does not adequately address the safety needs of all road users.\nIn summary, Ontario Bill 212, as currently structured, is a step in the wrong direction. It burdens Ontario with excessive regulation, harms the environment, restricts residents\u2019 choices, and jeopardizes public safety. I strongly urge a reconsideration of this bill to prioritize streamlined, environmentally friendly, and safety-oriented policies for Ontario\u2019s transportation future.\n"

        "comment": "The single biggest contributor to long commutes or congestion is other cars. Research shows that bike lanes can shorten commute times in (at least) two ways.\nFirst, bike lanes encourage people to bike and get them out of cars. This means less traffic on the main roadway, especially since bikes take up significantly less space than cars.\nSecond, bike lanes make traffic flow more uniform by removing bikes from the road. This makes it easier for drivers to navigate because they will have to worry less about cyclists appearing unexpectedly. Bike lanes make commuting faster, less stressful, and less dangerous for both drivers and cyclists.\nBike lanes are also proven to increase economic activity. In addition to reducing unproductive gridlock, measures that improve pedestrian or cyclist access can increase retail sales by as much as 30 per cent and each square metre of bike parking has five times the impact on retail sales when compared to car parking.\nThe overall result of obstructing bike infrastructure, and eliminating the little that currently exists, will be worse economic outcomes, and more dangerous road conditions.\nLastly, traffic lights technology have proven to be better at resolving congestion. A new generation of traffic tools has taken intersections well beyond green-yellow-red to include AI-enhanced 24/7 video surveillance, data collection and analysis, as well as the ability to optimize traffic signals on the fly.\n"

        "comment": "I oppose Ontario Bill 212 (Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024) for several critical reasons. Removing bike lanes won\u2019t reduce traffic congestion; studies and historical data have shown that taking away bike infrastructure actually slows traffic and increases gridlock. This move will not only worsen traffic flow in Toronto but also likely lead to injuries and potential fatalities.\nThe history of Toronto underscores this problem: when bike lanes were removed from Jarvis Street in 2011, city data showed that travel times increased, directly contradicting the goal of easing congestion. Removing bike lanes endangers cyclists, discourages sustainable transportation, and leads to even more cars on the road, compounding gridlock and pollution.\nRather than enacting policies that compromise safety and degrade urban infrastructure, the province should focus on initiatives that truly benefit residents, like improving healthcare and education. This kind of investment would serve Ontarians far better than dismantling bike lanes to appease drivers and suburban commuters.\nIn short, Bill 212 represents a step backward for Toronto and the province, sacrificing smart urban planning in favor of culture war rhetoric rather than sound political policy. The government should prioritize a livable, accessible city for everyone by supporting multimodal transportation that ensures safety, efficiency, and environmental responsibility\u2014not just catering to those driving into the city for work.\n"

        "comment": "I'd appreciate if decisions by the provincial government were made using evidence-based research.   There is lots of research showing that gridlock is caused by citizens relying on cars as the only viable form of transportation.    There is research showing that building more roads or having more lanes does not reduce gridlock in the long term.   There is research that shows that 90% of people shopping along Bloor street are pedestrians or cyclists.        Removing bike-lanes goes against all this research and has no research to support it will actually reduce gridlock or save \"me\" time.\nI live in Hamilton and I want a city where I can feel safe to cycle anywhere in the city.   And hamilton has done a great job improving their cycling network.   I can cycle 5km to work on 95% dedicated bike lanes.   I also have a car and would not cycle if I had to share the lanes with other vehicles.   By removing the bike lanes, you will be adding my car back onto the road and increasing gridlock.\nPlease stay out of making decisions that you are not following the research on.   It may get you a few votes in the short-term, however it will damage your legacy for decades to come.\n"

        "comment": "I am a mother of two children who lives in the area of Bloor West (between Runnymede and Jane, north of Bloor).  The implementation of bike lanes along Bloor St. West have greatly improved the quality of life for my family in our neighbourhood in terms of safety, area enjoyment and walkability/bikeability.\nWe shop the local businesses along Bloor St. West daily and have found that the street now feels majestic and grand and like a true Avenue where we were can, as pedestrians and bikers, enjoy life, free of the fear of getting hit by a car or having to run across four lanes of traffic to cross the road.  The traffic has slowed down and the bike lanes have created a barrier between the sidewalks and cars and it is truly enjoyable and relaxing and I now have the feeling of being in a European city where we know the local shop owners as do our children.\nWe use the bike lanes daily to take our children to school from north of Bloor, along Bloor and then South of Bloor.  We also use them to bike to our children's activities (tennis and baseball and soccer south of Bloor) and to enjoy High Park and Rennie park and Swansea both on weekdays and weekends.  We rarely have to rely on our car as I have a basket on my bike to carry items (like a small trunk of a car).\nBefore the bike lanes were implemented, I had to navigate local side streets, which still do not feel safe to take children on due to parked cars, narrow streets and two way driving and drivers not regularly abiding by local signage (speed limits, stop signs, etc).  The Bloor West bike lanes are free of debris, create unobstructed pathways for transportation and the barriers provide safety and space between bikers and cars.  I feel these lanes are safe for my children and require cars to slow down and look as they can expect bikers (prior to turning for example) where on local side streets, this is not the case.\nI do not think the provincial government should be overriding the municipal government in this case.  This is a local matter and should be handled by local government.\nThere are a number of fast driving thoroughfares in our neighbourhood (Queensway, Dundas, Lakeshore Blvd W, even Annette and the QEW).  Cars do not need to stop and shop along these stretches of road as there are limited businesses on them.  Bloor St. W should be for leisure and is not intended to be a thoroughfare.  There is ample parking behind the stores on the north side.  I would even suggest that most people in the area are walking and pedestrians and not drivers (between Runnymede and Jane).\nI would suggest that all those opposed to the Bloor bike lanes try to walk the street on a sunshiney day, buy a croissant from a local bakery and just sit and enjoy life.  When you're sitting in traffic, you get angry but there is a different way and it is here and I am proud to show my children what is possible and create a beautiful, local life for them. The Bloor West bike lanes have made this possible.  I have no doubt.\nThank-you for your consideration.\n"
