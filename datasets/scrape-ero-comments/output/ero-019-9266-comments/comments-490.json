        "comment": "This bill is outrageous, and is the exact opposite of what we should be doing with our tax dollars. Adding more red tape and bureaucracy instead of letting local government, and people, decide what is best for them. Of course, there are not many cyclists at the moment, but only because our cycling infrastructure is fragmented and unsafe at the moment, and is in its infancy. This should not be a partisan issue, biking lanes benefit everybody (the planet included). Douggy wishes he could ride a bike.\n"

        "comment": "This is silly - bike lanes are an important part of our overall transit infrastructure and need to be a NETWORK in order to enable throughput. If MORE bike lanes were divided from traffic I would be much more willing to cycle in Toronto. Removing these lanes is pushing us backwards in our transit journey, as well as being costly. Stop putting your nose in municipal business and work on funding healthcare!\n"

        "comment": "This bill is an absurd waste of taxpayer funds. There is no benefit to the province in whole or in part by forcing the removal of bike lanes. This is, at best, cartoon villain nonsense disguised as remedy.\nTraffic speeds and travel times by car will not improve in any meaningful way. I say this as someone who is a car owner and near-daily driver within the city of Toronto. The actual culprits are an excess of people driving for Uber/Lyft who have no concept of how to drive within the city limits, along with tourists coming into the city who should be using municipal transit to get around, rather than again, coming into a busy downtown core and making the roads much busier and much more dangerous on account of their inexperience.\nWhen I talk to friends who live in other cities in Ontario, they are filled with rage and frustration at the idea that the current government would rather piss away funding than use it for anything remotely beneficial for ALL Ontarians.\n"

Passing this would be an absolute shame and disgrace. Has anyone even considered the safety of cyclists?

        "comment": "Bill 212 is the opposite of what will work for Toronto in the future. We know the population of the GTA is exploding, and so is the downtown core. If we want to reduce traffic, we need to develop reliable alternatives for transportation. Instead of building an underground highway which has historically failed for North American cities such as Boston, we should emphasize the importance of high speed rail. 50% of the Canadian population lives in a straight line from Windsor to Montreal, if we built a train that would relieve so much congestion. This bill is misguided because it reduces the compliance stages to building a highway, we of course know will be filled with numerous accidents on the daily.\n"

This is an efficient way to move the economy around in the city. Lastly, it keeps bike riders safe! We certainly be less safe if bikes lose their lanes and are forced to exist with cars.\nLastly, the more bikes, the less pollution. Have you taken a big breath of the big smell in the city? Pollution is a risk factor to lung cancer!\n"

It's good for your physical and mental health, helps reduce emissions, and it's so much more pleasant than sitting in gridlock everyday. If you think bike lanes are always empty, perhaps take advantage and start biking!\n"

The bike lanes that currently exist have created a safe, affordable and environmentally-conscious commute option for people who actually live within the city of Toronto. Aside from the fact that this is not a provincial issue to begin with, it\u2019s a horrible proposal that will cost us time, peace from construction, money and our safety getting around the city. Toronto\u2019s roads don\u2019t belong to Ford, and if traffic is so horrible then we should be investing in alternative options for people to get around - public transit, walking, and bikes!\n"

        "comment": "As a Toronto resident, I am deeply frustrated and disappointed by the Ontario government's proposal to not only remove specific bike lanes from key arterial roads in Toronto, but to legislate provincial authority over municipal city planning.\nFor many, car ownership is out of the financial reach while municipal public transit (ie. TTC) are decades behind in terms of infrastructure and service making it increasingly unreliable. Cycling offers many a quick mode of transportation for commuting, as well as non-work related trips. It's important to note that removing bike lanes does not equate to eliminating cyclists - people will continue to cycle regardless of whether there are bike lanes or not. Without bike lane infrastructure, cyclists will simply be forced into unsafe circumstances, utilize the same lanes as motor vehicles. One only has to look at history to understand the consequences of not having dedicated bike lanes, especially on busy arterial roads. Should the Ontario government be so headstrong in dictating municipal city planning, then they, as a governing entity, have a duty to ensure safety of those in the city. In fact, I believe we should be investing in more bike lanes to create a continuous and safe network that encourages more individuals to cycle the same way that dediated wide, continuous sidewalks encourage those to walk. Anecdotally as a driver myself in Toronto, I prefer having bike lanes. It helps me feel safer and more confident having clear delineations on the road.\nMoreover, introducing more lanes for motor vehicles does not guarantee, let alone predictably estimate, less traffic congestion. In fact, introducing more lanes for vehicle traffic induces more demand for driving which leads to greater congestion. Even prior to the dedicated bike lanes on Bloor, Yonge and University, congestion was significant meaning that bike lanes are not the cause for congestion. Ironically, the city has seen increased travel times by car and greater congestion on roads and in parts of the city where there are no existing bike lanes, again pointing to the fact that congestion is not a direct by-product of the existance of bike lanes. Cars inherently is one of the least efficient modes of transportation in terms of the number of individuals moved per distance and space. By that logic, the Ontario government be  concerned with moving more people over greater distances with less space. Yet, there is no motion to remove street parking on these busy arterial roads which would achieve the goal of alleviating congestion without removing bike lanes.\nAdditionally, the part of the proposal that calls for provincial review and approval of future bike lanes is going to be adding more red tape and bureaucracy to cities and systems that desperately need less. Increased administrative red tape holds cities back from accelerated growth and innovation, which is a particular problem for a fast growing city that is struggling to meet the needs of its population. Less bureaocratic restrictions would speed up much needed progress in our cities and prepare better for future growth. Increased government overreach from the provincial level is not the answer.\nThe cost of removing bike lanes that the city of Toronto has already invested in while other public provincial services in healthcare and education continue to see cuts and neglect is truly a slap in the face to all Ontarians. I implore the Ontario government to prioritize our deteriorating public services over the micromanagement of Canada's largest city. Larger, more prominent cities around the world (ie. NYC, Paris, London) demonstrate that bike lanes are an important piece of the urban fabric, moves people and makes our cities vibrant. They are a clear example that investment into public infrastructure and transit (including bike lanes) are not hindrances to the health and flourishment of a city.\nThank you.\n"
