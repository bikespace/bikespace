However, this form states above \"We will not publish your comment if it includes any identifying information, like names, addresses, or phone numbers\" so the conflicting messages may be creating an unnecessary and undemocratic delay and or termination of important public input.\nIn 2024, the number of Toronto cyclist fatalities is greater than the previous three years. It is clear we are not moving forward with enough proper and safe bike lanes in a city with a growing population that wants to use bicycles as their mode of transportation.\nIn 2023, 5.7 million bike trips were made with the city's Bike Share program.\nGlobal research confirms that more cycling infrastructure (1) keeps citizens safe and saves lives while (2) bettering the commute for both cars and cyclists.\nI am both a driver and cyclist and I confirm that driving is much safer when there are visible, separated bike lanes.\nWe can no longer allow for so many single-occupant vehicles to clog our roads & intersections. Removing bike lanes is a wrong move for Toronto. We need only to look to European cities on how engrained cycling infrastructure creates more livable cities for citizens while increasing access to businesses and their success.\nUltimately, Toronto was on the right track and making adequate progress on safe cycling infrastructure. We cannot, as a city who wants this, allow a premiere to veto the wishes of the public.\n"

        "comment": "Dear Doug. Countless studies, thriving higher population cities, and examples from our city, show that bike lanes and public transit, are what improves traffic for everyone.\nThere was a recent INRIX study of our traffic and it shows the biggest bottlenecks are on our highways and where there is construction.\nLet's improve inter-municipality public transit. Let's improve cross-Ontario and province high-speed trains. We've reached a population and density, similar to Europe where this is viable and more effective.\nIncreasing and improving bike lanes for inner city transit as well has been proven. We're not the only cold city with bike lanes, Montreal, Vancouver, London, and the Scandinavian countries all prove the weather isn't preventing more people from using them. It's safety!!!\nBike lanes and better public transit allow more people options for what kind of transit they need and thus allowing cars too, to face less congestion.\nIt's safer, faster, cheaper, will hugely benefit our economy, and overall the better option for everyone (including you and other drivers) and the planet.\nAlso the land expropriation clause that was snuck in is downright dictatorial. Tell everybody about what you're doing here and see if it's actually what the people want.\n"

        "comment": "Traffic in Toronto is unbearable, and the transit system is lacking -- to say the least. I live just off a busy street with constant condo development, and rely on the bike lanes for both ease of movement, and a sense of safety, as I navigate busses, ubers, construction, etc. Removing such lanes -- and many other in our city -- would be outrages, not to mention a total waste of resources.\nI recently took advantage of the new lanes to go out to Etobicoke along Bloor, which was fantastic! Made parts of this city much more accessible to me.\nWe need more designated bike lanes, and more public transit, and less incentives to drive. Not less.\n"

        "comment": "The removal of bike lanes anywhere in Ontario would increase gridlock, reduce foot traffic to local businesses, increase pollution and noise, and most importantly harm the health of cyclists and pedestrians. I cycle to work every single day all year long unless it is the harshest of snow storms, in which case even driving a car is dangerous. I am also a licensed driver with a car. I have been hit 3 times by cars while cycling, in two different cities and had close calls more times than I can count. My life could have been permanently altered or ended each and every one of those times. I know people who have had life changing incidents, I know people who have died. This bill puts me and tens of thousands of others at risk and I might be killed one day as a result of it, if it is passed. I will not stop riding my bike because it is affordable, faster than driving in some cases, healthy, good for the environment, and even good for drivers. I wish the same consideration would be afforded to me by this government.\n"

        "comment": "As a resident of Toronto I am completely against this proposal. This is a government overreach into controlling how cities make the best choices possible for their residents, and this type of heavy handed governing by the Premier is completely antithetical to what the Conservative Party should stand for. These bike lanes have been an overwhelming success, working to create safe routes of travel for the thousands of residents in Toronto who do not rely on cars each day. It also makes pedestrians feel safer, reduces traffic noise, and encourages everyone to live more active and healthy lifestyles by creating a safe place to bike. As a driver, separating the bikes from direct traffic feels far safer as well. Not to mention, this proposal includes horrific legislation that would allow the provincial government to take your land without question if it\u2019s for the purpose of highway construction. As the daughter of farmers, who used to beleive the Conservative Party cared about rural Canadians, this type of overreach to expatriate rural owned lands is deplorable and disgraceful. Doug ford should be ashamed of himself for completely going against the ethos of his own party just to feed his ego. I do not support this proposal, and will not be voting conservative next election because of this proposal.\n"

        "comment": "Is this section not wildly open to interpretation?\nA provision prohibits registered owners from applying under the Expropriations Act for the adjustment of the date of possession for land that was expropriated by the Minister for the purposes of a priority highway project.\nDoes this actually remove the opportunity for landowners to request a reassessment of having their property reappropriated? Does this not literally infringe on Bill 190, Property Rights and Responsibilities Act, 2009?\n\"Under the Expropriations Act, an inquiry officer on an inquiry is required to consider the merits of the objectives of the expropriating authority and to add, as parties to an expropriation inquiry, the owners of all lands affected by the expropriation. The decision of an approving authority is subject to judicial review.\"\nThis seems incredibly damaging and not something the public would be comfortable with.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 is proposing to help eliminate congestion by removing bicycle lanes which the Government is planning to do on University Ave. ,Yonge St and Bloor St.  The use of bicycle lanes should remain with cities and not the provincial Government.  To suggest that the removal of these lanes will assist with traffic congestion is missing the point of why the lanes were created in the first place.  Congestion on these streets existed long before bike lanes were introduced.  The health and safety of cyclists should  be prioritized over traffic congestion.  Safety first needs to be adopted when selecting areas for cycling lanes.  Removal of the lanes will ultimately result an increase of cycling injuries which could be life changing for the parties involved.  The cyclist who could suffer  injuries or death and the car driver who could be charged with carless driving or vehicular manslaughter if the cyclist injuries caused death.  The use the identified cycling lanes reduces the probability of these types of occurrences happing as driver s are more aware of the lanes and cyclist are able to safely ride in a lane without fear of being hit.  Prior to bicycle lanes cyclist also had to be on the look out for drivers who parked their cars and open there doors resulting in the cyclist hitting the door causing injury.  This Bill is an example of the Governments lack of common sense and disregarding the safety of cyclists.  The decision as to were bike lanes should be implemented is a fit matter for the cities not the provincial government.\n"

By choosing to cycle, I am helping to reduce congestion and pollution and making the city more livable for everyone. Removing bike lanes would force cyclists like myself onto busy streets, increasing the risk of accidents and potentially pushing us back into cars, which would only add to traffic and emissions. I work at a fencing club, where all locations are in close proximity to Bloor St. I not only cycle to get to all three club locations around the city, but our students also use their bike or skateboards (within the bike lane) to get to their beloved sport safely and efficiently.\nBike lanes on streets like Bloor-Danforth have proven vital for safe commuting. Instead of taking them away, the Ontario government should be investing in more cycling infrastructure to support a healthier, greener, and less congested city.\n"

        "comment": "I vehemently oppose this bill, as do many, many Ontarians.\nFirst, the province should not be intervening in municipal decisions. It\u2019s fundamentally anti-democratic and represents massive overreach on the part of the province.\nSecond, bike lanes save lives. There will always be cyclists on the roads, and it is better for both the cyclists and drivers that they have separate, safe lanes of traffic. I both bike and drive, and I much prefer to have bike lanes on all roads, even if they cut down on space to drive. As a driver, I am terrified of hitting a cyclist, and as a cyclist, I am terrified of being hit.\nThird, bike lanes reduce congestion. I live just off of Bloor, and the bike lanes there have fundamentally changed how I move through the city. I am much less likely to drive or take an Uber because it is safer, easier, and sometimes quicker to bike. I believe that the more we invest in bike infrastructure, the more congestion will actually fall as more people shift to biking.\nFourth, specifically addressing the plan to rip out the bike lanes - I think we can all agree that it\u2019s ridiculous. As a taxpayer, I find it outrageous that a government would waste our tax dollars by building an infrastructure project and the spending more money ripping it out. Leave the bike lanes alone. It will cause years more of horrific traffic to remove them, and it makes this government look incompetent and absurd. You should be embarrassed of the waste and expense of this ridiculous proposal, if nothing else.\n"

        "comment": "I find this whole process to be anti democratic and counter to the best interests of the people of Toronto who are in the best position to determine their local priorities and how best to meet them. Seizing land and bypassing the provisions of the expropriation Act to build or expand highways, and removing bike lanes that were created as a result of a democratic and consultative process is entirely the wrong direction to take. There are too many tragic stories of cyclists who lost their lives or their mobility as a result of being hit by drivers in situations where the victims were not adequately protected by bike lanes. The answer is not to increase the road capacity for cars at the expense of cyclists. Cars will always fill the existing capacity of the road system and we will be right back to the same jammed conditions as existed before, with the cost borne by cyclists who are helping to keep cars off the road. This is a terrible idea. Please do not proceed.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal will do nothing to reduce gridlock or improve traffic flow on major roads. When bike lanes were installed, traffic studies were conducted demonstrating that the Doug Ford government is lying about the impact of bike lanes. In three years when the lanes are gone traffic flow will not have improved. Meanwhile, an increasing number of cyclists and mobility scooter users will have to take full lanes of traffic, with the expectation that an increase in accidents and fatalities will occur.\nThis bill is a shortsighted populist attempt to win favour with some voters who have been convinced by the Premier and others that there is a \"war on cars\", and a stupid and ultimately expensive decision is being made at the expense of evidence-based governance.\nAs a large number of empirical research studies have demonstrated, the only effective strategy for reducing gridlock is to reduce the number of vehicles on the road. Cycling presents one such alternative.\nHistory is not kind to populist leaders who govern based on 'gut instincts' rather than through the analysis of empirical evidence.\n"

        "comment": "The removal of bike lanes has been clearly shown in several studies not to reduce congestion. This is a known phenomenon called Braess' paradox and will substantially worsen areas of already bad congestion if bike lanes are removed from major streets in the city. Furthermore, thousands of riders use these lanes daily for commutes, transiting children, and personal use. Without bike lanes, they will be significantly more in danger or more likely to use already crowded and unreliable transit or cars that many do not have room for. Bikes alleviate much of these issues already, and further bikes lanes, better funded transit, and more robust safety mechanisms for riders must be the solution.\n"
