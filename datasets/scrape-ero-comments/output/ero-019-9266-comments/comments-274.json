        "comment": "This proposal is dangerous to pedestrians, bikers, and all people living in the city. Those bike lanes encourage people to use their bikes instead of a car. This is good for the planet and good for the city. It is more environmentally sustainable and provides Torontonians with a safe and economical way to get around the city. Since those bike lanes have been created I have used them regularly and have benefitted from their central locations. Cities should not be built only for cars. Cities should be built for people. This is a horrible proposal and the province should be ashamed of themselves. The province is just going to waste more money reversing something that was fine to begin with and destroy the city further in the process. This is not what residents of Toronto want. We shouldn't be encouraging driving when the effects of climate change are worse and worse each year. Shame on you.\n"

        "comment": "I would ask the province to reconsider this legislation. It is misguided. I understand that the province wants to help solve congestion, but this unfortunately, is not an evidence-based approach to resolve congestion. Indeed, all this legislation will do is make cyclists bike in the middle of the live traffic lane, and then cars will be parked where the current bicycle lane is. In this communications the province has cited outdated (2011) data that applied to the whole GTA, not the city of Toronto. More recent data shows that approximately 70% of Toronto residents cycle. Indeed, the routes targeted by this legislation are the most popular routes (seeing upwards of 8,000 cyclists a day on the Bloor bike lanes, alone), representing about 40% of all vehicular traffic on that route.\nBikes are extremely efficient modes of transportation. Encouraging more cycling (by having good cycling infrastructure, like the ones targeted by this legislation) is the only path forward. It is perplexing why this province is going to spend taxpayer money and resources to destroy infrastructure.\nThis legislation will cause significant safety issues for all road users (cyclists/pedestrians, particularly), while making congestion worse on the targeted routes. It truly is a perplexing piece of legislation that should be completely abandoned. If the province moves forward with this, the bike lanes will just be re-installed after the government is out of office. So the province is just wasting its time and money for nothing.\n"

        "comment": "I am a resident of Toronto and a cyclist. I use my bike to get to work every day. Removing the bike lanes on Bloor, Yonge and University will put me and many other cyclists at risk. More bike lanes = fewer cars, which is ultimately how you improve traffic on our streets. The city invested a lot of funds to install these safe bike lanes in the first place, removing them would represent a huge waste. Why would the Provincial government want to spend even more to make Ontarians less safe on our streets? Save our bike lanes! Keep our cyclists safe!\n"

If enacted, this bill will endanger my life and the lives of my family members, along with countless others who use these bike lanes as their lifelines.\nWe live here. These are our streets and our homes. Why are you prioritizing convenience for drivers at the expense of the safety of people who live here?\nThis is a ridiculously ill-conceived idea, given how research has consistently demonstrated bike lanes ease traffic congestion.\nWould you rather I just buy a car and jam up traffic even more? To quote our premier: \"Folks, give your heads a shake.\"\nThis bill has left me seriously considering moving from this province.\n"

Adding provincial oversight to bike lanes is a huge waste of taxpayer dollars. There is a housing crisis, a health care crisis, and many more urgent problems facing Ontario. Why are we wasting our time just because Doug ford doesn\u2019t like seeing bikers move faster than his car on his commute.\n"

Ha ha ha what a joke. It is so low.\nIs the subway along Bloor Street profitable?  Why would you cannibalize subway public transit by putting bike lanes on Bloor?\nAnd those white posts are so ugly. The prettiness of the Kingsway is gone. Who thought these posts were a good idea?  Where in the world do you see this?\nGet rid of the bike lanes on Bloor. I don't care what it costs.\n"

        "comment": "Removing these bike lanes is a terrible idea. Congestion is caused by bad drivers who don't follow rules, drive distracted, etc. Drivers block intersections, not allowing other vehicles to move ahead when they have the right of way. Drivers are the ones getting into collisions, stalling traffic and causing delays.\nThis government should focus on providing more alternatives to driving downtown, period. Take more cars off the road. There is literally a subway line right there under Yonge St, University Ave and Bloor Street! No need for so many drivers commuting downtown. Take the GO train! Take the subway!\nThis government has no long term vision. Bunch of short sighted maroons focused on getting votes when they call an early election. Removing these is a waste of our public money.\n"

        "comment": "This is incredible overreach from the provincial government. You do not have the authority to dictate to municipalities whether or not they install or have bicycle lanes. Unbelievable!\nThis government seems to forget that for every adult riding on a bike in a cycle lane, a car has been removed from the gridlock that you say you want to alleviate. Public transit obviously isn't solving the issue, which could be another option for you to pursue. Cars add to the pollution of our cities and it seems that you want the car to be the only way to move from point A to point B.\nA healthy community provides the means for its citizens to enjoy recreational activities. Cycling is one of those. Providing a safe way to do so should be a priority. Bicycle lanes do that. They also allow for other ways to run errands or go to work. We also have a society that is becoming more and more sedentary, increasing health care costs as a result. Removing or preventing the addition of bicycle lanes is incredibly short-sighted.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes is a costly setback, compromising safety, sustainability, and Ontario\u2019s economy. Studies show that bike lanes boost local businesses by increasing foot traffic and reducing car dependence, leading to increased retail sales and property values along these corridors. Cities worldwide are investing in bike infrastructure to cut congestion costs, improve public health, and reduce emissions. Ontario must follow suit. Removing these lanes jeopardizes the progress we\u2019ve made toward safer, more livable cities. We urge you to retain and expand bike lanes\u2014not dismantle them.\nI strongly oppose this bill.\n"

        "comment": "Bikes are \"traffic\" too and both the Bloor and Yonge bike lanes generate a substantial amount of bike traffic. Removing the bike lane doesn't remove the bike traffic, it just slows everyone down further as bikes flow at a different speed than cars.\nRemoving the bike lanes will not improve traffic flow. But it will cause the unnecessary and entirely preventable loss of additional lives. When someone dies because of this, it will be the Province's fault. Is the Province really ready to deliberately endanger people to score cheap partisan political points?\n"

When you take a person out of a car by putting them on a bike, there is more room for the remaining cars on the road.\nAlso, if bike lanes caused traffic, why does the 401 have so much traffic? the DVP? Where are the bike lanes slowing everything down there?\n"
