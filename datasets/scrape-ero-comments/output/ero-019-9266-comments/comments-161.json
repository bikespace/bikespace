You're telling me that municipalities don't have the ability to audit they own traffic and decide what's best for the city? Who does city planning, the city or the province?\nThe Ontario Premier coming out and blatantly calling out numerous streets that need bike lanes removed before anything has been passed or analyzed is frankly insulting.\nAs a Canadian, I strive to have a city that is more walkable, offers alternative means of transportation, commute on a bicycle safely and encourages others to be active.\nI fail to see how provincial money should be spent on this issue considering city planning does not.\nNot only is this a waste of tax payer money, considering the multitude of actual issues in our province but also fails to follow any of the data.\nI could link 100s of studies and reports of bike lanes easing traffic woes, hence why so many cities implement them. NYC, european cities with small roads/congestion issues.\nCycling is accessible to those who are lower income, and bike lanes provide a safe place to commute.\n"

        "comment": "I've taken a ln interest in bike infrastructure this year an didn't realize how far behind Canada was compared to some other countries. I understand Canada is a big place with neighboring cities being a few hours away, vehicles are very important to our lives and the economy. However stopping or even worse removing the infrastructure we currently have especially in a city like Toronto I feel is a step backwards, not only would it reduce the amount of cyclists or moves more cyclist's to side walks, but also increases the danger to cyclists. If the plan is to reduce traffic the goal should be to improve and expand on current bike info structure, reducing the amount of local traffic especially since nobody needs to drive somewhere they can get to in 30 mins on a bike and can be stored in a backpack. In Addition with the current cost of living being so high, it would benefit many people to switch to bikes saving hundred to thousands of dollars annually, the list goes on. For me personally on this topic I bike everywhere  in Kingston, but whenever I'm in Toronto I'm stuck in traffic 70% of the time and everyone I know is either stressed or hates driving in Toronto.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my concerns regarding the provincial encroachment on local decision-making related to bike lanes. As a 100% driver who does not bike, I still recognize the importance of maintaining and expanding bike lane infrastructure for the benefit of our communities.\nIt is crucial that cities like Kingston and Toronto retain the autonomy to determine their own infrastructure needs, particularly when it comes to promoting cycling. Allowing the Mayor of Ontario to dictate whether cities can install or maintain bike lanes undermines local governance and disregards the voices of residents who rely on these critical transportation options.\nMoreover, removing bike lanes will not reduce traffic congestion; instead, it will likely exacerbate the issue. Cyclists will be forced to share car lanes, increasing the risk of accidents and discouraging cycling altogether. True traffic reduction can only be achieved by enhancing public transport and encouraging walking and cycling, not by prioritizing car accessibility.\nMany cities have invested significant resources in bike lane infrastructure, such as the recently completed lanes on University Avenue in Toronto. To dismantle these improvements is not only a gross misuse of public funds but also a disservice to the community. As a concerned Ontarian, I believe these funds should be redirected to essential services like education and healthcare, rather than wasted on reversing progress in sustainable transportation.\nI urge the Environmental Registry to support local decision-making and prioritize the health and safety of our communities.\nThank you for considering my views.\n"

I work at Toronto General Hospital and the introduction of the bike lanes on University has made my ride so much safer. Cars drive far too fast on University, to the point that at 6am on my way to work I will witness SUV accidents where the cars end up flipped UPSIDE DOWN. Limiting cycling infrastructure is not how to get this city moving faster. Invest in transit. Invest in cycling infrastructure. Make decisions based on evidence. It is the absolute least a government could do. Or better yet, leave municipal choices up to the municipality. There are many issues for the Premier to focus on across Ontario.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing regarding the proposed framework requiring provincial approval for municipal bike lanes. This proposal raises significant concerns when evaluated against both the fundamental rights established in the Environmental Bill of Rights (EBR) and the Ministry's Statement of Environmental Values (SEV).\nFundamental Right to a Healthful Environment The EBR, as referenced in your SEV, establishes that \"the people of Ontario have a right to a healthful environment.\" This fundamental right must be understood to encompass our urban environments, where the majority of Ontarians live, work, and move through daily. Consider that:\nUrban environmental health directly impacts human wellbeing through:\nAir quality at street level where people walk and bike\nNoise levels that affect mental and physical health\nSafe spaces for active transportation and community interaction\nAccess to sustainable transportation options\nStreet-level temperatures and urban heat island effects\nOverall quality of life in our communities\nBike lanes contribute substantially to this healthful urban environment by:\nCreating safer streets for all users, including pedestrians\nReducing local air pollution exposure through decreased vehicle traffic\nDecreasing noise pollution that impacts sleep, cardiovascular health, and cognitive development\nEnabling active transportation that improves public health\nBuilding more livable, human-scaled urban environments\nSupporting sustainable urban development patterns\nProviding equitable access to transportation options\nThe proposed framework, by creating barriers to bike lane implementation, risks infringing upon this fundamental right to a healthful environment. The EBR's mandate \"to protect, conserve and where reasonable, restore the integrity of the environment\" must apply to our urban environment where environmental quality directly impacts human health and wellbeing.\nSpecific Concerns with the Proposed Framework\nContradiction of Multi-Modal Transportation Goals Your SEV explicitly commits to \"promoting a multi-modal transportation network, including active transportation.\" Most notably, your SEV specifically recognizes that improving \"public transit and active transportation networks\" helps \"manage congestion and reduce gridlock.\" However, the proposed framework:\nContradicts your own policy position that active transportation helps reduce congestion\nCreates new barriers to implementing active transportation infrastructure that could help manage gridlock\nPrioritizes single-occupancy vehicle traffic over sustainable transportation options that could reduce overall congestion\nUndermines your priority of \"increasing transit ridership\" by making it harder for people to bike to transit stations\nContradicts your commitment to \"promote an integrated transportation system that facilitates the use of public transit, active transportation, and other modes\"\nPlaces an undue burden on municipalities trying to develop integrated transportation networks that could help reduce gridlock\nEnvironmental Assessment Concerns While the proposal states that \"implications to the environment will be considered,\" this approach appears insufficient given your SEV commitments to:\n\"Integrate sustainability into the ministry's decision making, programs, policies and operations\"\n\"Reduce transportation-related air emissions\"\n\"Reduce transportation-related discharges of contaminants to water\"\n\"Support the Government of Ontario's initiatives to conserve energy\"\nThe framework should require comprehensive environmental impact assessments that consider:\nAir quality impacts\nStormwater runoff contamination from increased vehicle traffic, including:\nOil and gasoline leaks\nTire particles and microplastics\nBrake dust and heavy metals\nRoad salt and de-icing chemicals\nSediment and debris\nThe cumulative effect of these contaminants on local watersheds and water quality\nThe relative benefits of bike infrastructure, which produces virtually no water pollution\nClimate Change Obligations Your SEV specifically commits to:\n\"Reduce the impact of Ontario's transportation sector on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions\"\n\"Increase the availability of sustainable modes of travel\"\n\"Support Ontario businesses in developing sustainable new mobility technologies and innovations\" The proposed framework makes it harder to achieve these objectives by creating additional obstacles to sustainable transportation infrastructure.\nEvidence-Based Decision Making The proposal's narrow focus on traffic impacts:\nIgnores your SEV commitment to consider integrated \"social, economic, and scientific considerations\"\nCreates an asymmetric burden of proof that applies only to sustainable transportation infrastructure, where:\nOnly bike lanes must be justified with data\nNo similar requirements exist for car infrastructure\nMunicipalities face extra administrative burdens for sustainable options\nThe default assumption favors car infrastructure without equivalent scrutiny\nOverlooks the comprehensive benefits of bike lanes, including:\nReduced air pollution from decreased vehicle traffic\nSignificantly lower noise pollution, which research has linked to:\nCardiovascular disease\nSleep disturbance\nCognitive impairment in children\nMental health impacts\nReduced property values\nImproved public health outcomes through active transportation\nEnhanced road safety for all users\nEconomic benefits for local businesses and communities, including:\nIncreased retail spending from bike and foot traffic\nHigher property values on calmer, more livable streets\nReduced road maintenance costs\nGreater neighborhood desirability\nMore equitable transportation access\nMunicipal Planning Integration Your SEV emphasizes \"promoting the integration of transportation, land use and environmental planning in decision making.\" However, this framework:\nUndermines municipal authority to implement context-appropriate transportation solutions\nCreates regulatory uncertainty for municipalities planning long-term transportation networks\nMay discourage municipalities from pursuing active transportation projects due to additional bureaucratic requirements\nCould delay implementation of urgent safety improvements\nRecommendations:\nRevise the framework to include comprehensive evaluation criteria that align with your SEV and the EBR's fundamental right to a healthful environment, including:\nEnvironmental benefits (both natural and urban)\nPublic health impacts\nSafety improvements\nEconomic effects on local businesses and communities\nAccessibility enhancements\nClimate change mitigation potential\nIntegration with existing transportation networks\nEnsure the \"specified criteria\" mentioned in the proposal:\nReflect the full range of benefits that bike lanes provide\nConsider both immediate and long-term impacts\nAccount for municipal transportation master plans\nInclude environmental and health metrics\nSupport the achievement of provincial climate targets\nRecognize the value of creating healthful urban environments\nModify the data collection requirements to:\nInclude metrics beyond just traffic flow\nConsider seasonal variations in cycling usage\nAccount for induced demand in both driving and cycling\nMeasure safety improvements and public health outcomes\nEvaluate impacts on community wellbeing and urban environmental health\nI urge the Ministry to align this framework with both its own environmental values and the fundamental right to a healthful environment established in the EBR. The current proposal risks undermining Ontario's progress toward creating healthier, more sustainable, and more equitable communities for all residents.\n"

Why is the province wasting its time and resources micro managing municipalities?\nSecond, ripping out existing bike lines is just a stupid waste of money.\nYou want to reduce gridlock? Reduce the number of people in cars. Thats it. That is literally the only way. There is endless data demonstrating this. You will not solve gridlock with new lanes, or by pissing away billions of dollars on a tunnel. You need to\na) Divert people away from high density areas. People should not be growing THROUGH Toronto unless their destination is in Toronto\nb) Providing effective alternative transport methods such as robust public transit and avenues for active transport (LIKE BIKE LANES), so people can do things other then drive.\nc) Change zoning laws to allow for more mixed use neighbourhoods so more people can live close to where they work so they dont have to commute, or at the very least, live close to shops and services so they can access the majority of what they need either without a car, or with a very short drive.\nBlatantly ignoring evidence based solutions because the Premier has decided he has a beef with bike lanes for some reason will make gridlock worse, not better, and your time and tax payer money would be better spent addressing issues like Healthcare and Education, that are actually the province's responsibility, instead of micromanaging municipal affairs.

        "comment": "This is intrusive provincial overreach into immensely local decision making with respect to bike lane permissions. Urban planning principles all over the world, including from other Canadian cities such as Vancouver and Montreal, show that adding bike lanes and additional transportation options, reduces vehicle dependence, and gives people more options. Whereas adding additional car lanes just provides for induced demand, leading to more drivers.\nLocal city planners have the best feel for local conditions, when building comprehensive transit networks including bike lane grids, and public transit. Removing bike lanes creates less opportunities for families to go car-free by choice, less opportunity for healthy transportation, and creates more emissions. Bike lanes reduce car demand, leaving the remaining lanes (especially when fully segregated bike lanes are installed) flowing more freely.\nThe province does not need to micromanage these decisions from afar, just like the province did not need to ban ranked choice voting for the municipalities who wished to experiment with it. Let the cities plan in peace, without the extra layers of red tape and micromanagement that this government publicly says they want to reduce, but in practice is only increasing.\nAnd sneaking Highway approval planning into the same bill is poor form. All of this is backwards steps for protection of the environment and the long-term health of our province.\n"
