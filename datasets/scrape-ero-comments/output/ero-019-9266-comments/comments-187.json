The data supports the need for bike lanes. Why is the Ford government refusing to believe hard facts? This costly mistake will not only waste millions of taxpayer dollars, it will kill Torontonians. But let\u2019s not forget about the disgusting corruption behind exempting new highways from environmental and other studies. This government is scared of the truth. Pathetic.\n"

        "comment": "The City of Toronto insisting on forcing these under utilized bike lanes is artificially creating traffic congestion. The problem isn't that there's more cars now than 10-15 years ago; the issue is that the city planners are anti car. Looking past the long list of other things that have been enacted to force more cars to sit idle unnecessarily, bike lanes are only popularly used 2 months, maximum, out of the year. The rest of the time, they sit empty while car traffic is forced to build up because of the lack of road space. Reducing a 2 lane road to 1 lane and bike lane forces cars to wait behind letting and right turning vehicles, which is forcing longer idle times, all while 1 cyclist passes the traffic while riding on the road, not the bike lane. Stop forcing bike lanes on this city under the guise of eco friendly; it is an anti car tactic to make them seem worse for traffic and the environment.\nIf you're not willing to see the civilian reason, also consider that emergency vehicles cannot utilize those spaces in an emergency. Service vehicles are forced to avoid direct routes or take longer to get to those destination because they are stuck in the traffic because the traffic has nowhere to move over to.\nStop building bike lanes in Toronto.\n"

Removal of bike lanes is an unnecessary expense, and an excessive provincial overreach. Stay in your lane.\nIf the goal truly is to reduce congestion, the focus must be on public transit to alleviate single passenger car travel, and improve highway access around the GTA by lower the bar to access the 407 or shifting traffic to it.\nLastly, this proposal seeks to skirt critical environmental assessments for the dubious 413 construction, which is wholly irresponsible and unnecessary. These protections exist for a reason, and are not to be ignored when inconvenient. If the assessments harm the viability of the project, the proposed construction plan must be improved to be meet the needed criteria that all other developments must also satisfy.\n"

        "comment": "I am privileged to live in an area on downtown Toronto where cycling, walking, public transit and driving are all viable options, and I find myself constantly negotiating between these modes of transportation. Small incentives to opt for one over the other makes a big difference. Over the past 5 years, I've seen myself gravitating towards biking as infrastructure became more ubiquitous and increased my comfort commuting by bike.\nBike infrastructure decreases the barrier to entry for making cycling a go-to mode of transportation. For example, my commute to work via cycling used to require zigzagging through residential roads as advised by a coworker. Each new destination required research, and adding stops for errands in between was intimidating and required planing. Now that main arteries (ie. Bloor, College) have bike lanes, cycling to novel destinations is far more accessible. It's for this reason that I find myself gravitating towards biking south of Bloor and reach for the car north of Bloor.\nFurthermore, it makes sense that roads with many small businesses on them are friendly to pedestrian and bike traffic. It's not practical to build parking infrastructure for cars next to these businesses, so incentivizing pedestrian, public transit and cycling and disincentivizing driving on these roads is beneficial for small businesses as well.\nThe decrease of traffic lanes for the creation of bike lanes is not a zero sum game. The human-scale and form factor of bikes means that a bike lane has to capacity to transport more people per square foot than a car can (especially when seating one person per car). Any incentive to nudge people to choose cycling over driving could therefore have positive impacts for traffic overall. For example, if people only choose to make trips by car when they absolutely had to (ie. transporting cargo larger than a bike could), car traffic would improve for all as well.\nAs a driver and someone whose work relies on driving large vehicles around the city, I appreciate how bike lanes keep cyclists separate from traffic and adds predictability. I have different routes for each mode of transportation and understand that driving in the downtown core is a privilege not a right.\nOther cities (like Hong Kong) are designed so that cars and bikes do not share the road in the first place. While this is no longer an option for us, the solution to the problems with bike lanes is to improve them and continue to make them a more attractive mode of transportation, not remove them. For example, if bike lanes are not used in the winter because they are not plowed, then they should be properly plowed (I find that it's often down well and quality in downtown Toronto, so biking is still my preferred method of transportation in the winter!).\nAll of the above points are logistical reasons to keep bike lanes that reduce traffic lanes under municipal jusrisdiction, not even considering the myriad of health and environmental benefits that arise from increasing a municipality's bikeability.\n"

        "comment": "Setting aside the massive, undemocratic overreach by the province - as a driver, cyclist, and pedestrian in Toronto, the thing we need most for ALL of us is fewer cars on the road. We need it for the environment, for safety, and for general ease and quality of life in our city. On most streets in Toronto, cars have to creep by each other, edging bikes and pedestrians out, on streets that were never designed to have two lanes and street parking. It's dangerous for property and life. The only effective, long term way to make space on our streets is to offer alternative transportation infrastructure: BIKE LANES!! And safe, walkable sidewalks (which, incidentally, bike lanes help with, by providing a buffer between cars and pedestrians, especially when they are separated by solid dividers) and a functioning transit system, in which the province has completely failed us. Like Mayor Chow said, do your job, stay in your lane (and hands off ours).\n"

        "comment": "As a resident of Toronto who enjoys cycling, including for basic errands like grocery shopping, the recent proposals by the Premier of Ontario to require provincial approval for new bike lanes, and especially the additional suggestion that the existing bike lanes on Bloor and Yonge Streets should be removed by provincial authority, are greatly upsetting.\nFirst and foremost, I firmly believe that the way that municipal governments choose to regulate traffic falls outside the responsibilities of the provincial government. Even if no legislation exists to give municipalities strong enough powers to oppose provincial decisions like these, that does not mean that the province doing this would be a reasonable or fair exercise of its power. To simplify, just because the province can do it, does not mean that it should \u2013\u00a0certainly not without extensive consultation with the residents of the areas affected. The proposed legislation represents a disappointing degree of provincial overreach in municipal affairs. The Premier of Ontario is not the Mayor of Toronto, and has a mandate to serve the people of Ontario as a whole, not micromanage cities in the province at will. (Might I suggest running for mayor in the next Toronto municipal election? Perhaps that would be a more suitable job for a Premier who keeps expressing such a keen interest in municipal affairs.)\nSecondly, a decision to prioritize motor vehicles at the direct expense of bicycle infrastructure would be a step backwards in terms of both safety and efficiency. I can attest from my own experience that in areas of Bloor Street without physical barriers between the bike lane and the main road, drivers do often enter the bike lane. Removing the bike lane entirely would force cyclists onto the main road, which would not only make cycling more risky, but would also slow down traffic (despite the stated purpose of this legislation being to reduce gridlock), since slower cyclists would need to share the road with faster motor vehicles. It makes perfect sense on busy streets to have separated lanes for drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians, since these three modes of transportation have sizeable differences in speed.\nLastly, I believe that there is a reasonable financial argument to be made against the proposal to remove existing bike lanes on several busy Toronto streets: if the intention is reducing motor vehicle traffic, then one way to do that is to encourage people to reduce usage of motor vehicles \u2013\u00a0for instance, by subsidizing public transit to improve frequency and capacity. Investing money in removing bike lanes would be wasteful when that money could clearly be put to better use in an additive rather than subtractive way. If that money goes to the TTC and/or Metrolinx instead of removing bike lanes, it could help make it easier for people to reconsider driving on streets that are already heavily-trafficked and just take the subway instead.\n"

The number of cars and gridlock does not decrease when a city is made less cycle-friendly. These increase. Similarly, a city is not free of gridlock when public transportation is not invested in. This proposal is offensive and the epitome of a short term solution with no long-term planning. Accessible cities lower gridlock and decrease climate change. Leave these decisions to municipalities who are on the ground with their stakeholders and know their constituents.\n"

        "comment": "The proposed legislation is misguided, unlikely to \"solve\" congestion in urban centers, and most importantly, fuels the car vs bike culture war and endangers cyclists both in terms of physical infrastructure and attitudes from drivers. As someone who commutes by all forms of transit, including car, bicycle, and rail, I believe I have a right to travel safely by whatever means I choose. In recent years it has been good to see my tax dollars at work creating equitable, diverse means of wayfinding around the city, after nearly a century of car-centric infrastructure development and policy making. Removing these lanes won\u2019t solve congestion when literally millions keep sprawling further and further out of the core and have no option but to drive downtown due to our impoverished transit systems. I\u2019m not going to demonize anyone who chooses to live in a suburban or exurban community, given the costs and some people\u2019s desire for a parcel of land, but urban sprawl absolutely worsens congestion. There needs to be a multifaceted effort to tackle congestion, including congestion taxes for downtowns, massive enhancement and expansion of suburban rail, and densification within the cores of cities and along major mass transit routes. This proposal takes Ontario backwards, when urban centers all around the world are moving toward more mixed use and dedicated infrastructure for ALL road users, rather than only car-driving suburbanites.\n"

        "comment": "Study after study has concluded that the only way to reduce traffic congestion is to provide viable alternatives to driving. Since the installation of bike lanes on major streets, many more Torontonians of all ages have felt safe enough to cycle on our streets. Removing bike lanes will force cyclists into dangerous situations where their life may be at risk.\nThis government claims that their policies are based on evidence, and yet blatantly ignores the fact that public transportation and bike lanes have a higher throughput of traffic than a lane of single-occupancy vehicles. It is simple geometry that if every person who is now biking in the bike lanes switches to driving a car, congestion will only get worse.\nThis government consistently makes decisions that favour the convenience of wealthy suburbanites who want to speed dangerously through urban neighbourhoods over the very health and safety of the people living in those communities.\nThe Bloor Annex BIA has publicly stated that bike lanes on Bloor have actually helped their member businesses. There is further evidence that bike lanes and a more pleasant and safe pedestrian realm bring more customers to shops and restaurants than more parking and more lanes of traffic. Removing these lanes is an expensive way to only make congestion worse in the long term.\nIt has been clear for many years now that this PC government has a disdain for the City of Toronto and its citizens. I have to wonder if the Minister of Transport has even walked along Bloor St in the last five years to witness how much of a nicer experience the streetscape is since the installation of bike lanes and traffic calming measures. There is a subway line with a daily ridership of 400,000 people per day running underneath the street. Why is this government encouraging people to drive on this and other major transit corridors?\n"

Are they then going to start whining for more car lanes?\n.\nI can remember several billion dollars ago when the O-Train was supposed to be the greatest thing since sliced bread, and now that it's here, it's a joke. Even as little as 20 years ago, we had one of the leading transportation systems in North America, and now our transportation system is broken in the worst way.\n.\nJust like the O-Train, the bike lanes are a cycle (no pun intended).\n.\nOpinion by a person born and raised in Ottawa\n"
