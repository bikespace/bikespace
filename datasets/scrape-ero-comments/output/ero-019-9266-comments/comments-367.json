        "comment": "It is outrageous that the Ontario government is not only overstepping into matters of municipal jurisdiction, but that it is also doing so on the basis of nothing more than \"I don't like seeing bikes speed past me when I'm stuck in traffic\". Never mind the years of actual research and data that shows that bike lanes improve business incomes, and that infrastructure that supports people getting out of cars (which actually a large number of Torontonians doing that, much more than the outdated 1% figure being bandied about) improves traffic not the other way around, not to mention SAVING LIVES, because apparently Doug Ford thinks his \"instincts\" are more reliable than the real data and experience of professionals. And of course removing environmental assessments so that Doug's highways can be pushed through as well. Shame on you all, and know that you will have yet more deaths on your hands for the cyclists who will die as a result of Doug Ford's petty war on Toronto. Shame on you.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is an overreach of provincial powers into an area that should be the responsibility of municipalities.\nThe bike lanes on Bloor, Yonge, and University in Toronto have made it easier and safer for me to drive in these roads. Before these lanes were installed, cyclists shared the road with cars, often slowing traffic and creating unsafe situations.\nRemoving these lanes will increase traffic, contrary to the assumption of this legislation. Bike lanes do not cause congestion.\nI furthermore do not believe that the minister should have the power to keep the results of environmental assessment secret from the public. This clearly does not serve the public interest and should be immediately struck from the bill.\nPlease withdraw this mistaken and misdirected legislation.\n"

While I could drive my daughter to daycare, I instead bike, clearing up congestion. Remove bike lanes and you will have tens of thousands more cars on the roads.\nBike lanes also make us safer. We don\u2019t worry about getting doored or hit by cars. As a driver, I prefer separated bike lanes because I feel more comfortable sharing the road this way.\nRemoving completed bike lanes is financially irresponsible.\nAnd finally, this is a municipal issue. The city is conducting research and consultations on bike lanes. Please focus on broader Ontario wide issues that you have jurisdiction over.\nThank you.\n"

If the bike lane is removed, I will be forced to take up the whole lane to make sure that car drivers notice me and don't run me over. Or I will take my car, and add one more car to the already congested street.\n"

Bike lanes reduce the number of cars on the road which also contribute to safety. Biking is an environmentally safe way to get around in the city.

        "comment": "This proposal is not based in reality. The only way to reduce gridlock and save time is by providing alternatives to motor vehicle transport. Removing bike lanes is a step closer to further grid lock.\nMany cities around the world that implement bike lanes and other alternatives to driving experience less congestion and reduced emissions. Business also see improvements, like more foot traffic.\nIf this is the goal of the Premier, why would his government propose doing the opposite?\nThe Premier talks about the traffic on Bloor and Young street, but by removing bikes lanes more people will take trips by car and traffic will be even worse.\nThis bill will hurt Ontario, not help it.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes keep everyone safe: cyclists, car users and pedestrians.\nI have been living and working in downtown Toronto since 2006. I used to bike when most roads didn't have a bike lane. One windy day, the wind blew me onto the traffic - it was a near miss, but a frightening one at that. I decided to only bike on streets that have bike lanes. This meant that for some trips that do not have bike lanes, I had to use the car, therefore increasing the amount of cars on the road, contributing to traffic congestion.\nI recall the times when there was no bike lanes on university avenue. I was a pedestrian, and some cyclists, not feeling safe on the road, would often cycle on the sidewalk, endangering pedestrians.\nAs a driver, the most significant traffic congestions are those on Gardiner and 401, where there are no bike lanes.\nWe voted for a mayor that is a champion of sustainable transportation and cycling. This overreach by the Ontario government is essentially undoing democracy.\nThe ontario government can require that studies be made to inquire on the effects of bike lanes on traffic. But actually specifying which bike lanes to keep and which to remove should be up to the city. Even if its up to the Ontario government, we haven't seen actual systematic studies done that support the idea that removing bike lanes from Yonge, Bloor and University will improve traffic. And even if it will, how much is the expected improvement, and is this worth the risk to lives?\nI recall the story of a cyclist who got ran over by a garbage truck on Bloor street and he died. The government should be thinking of ways to improve protection of cyclists to avoid such incidents in the future. Instead, this proposal is removing the little protection that cyclists currently have.\nThe proposal also mentions the businesses. Yonge street in particular is full of restaurants that deliver food using bikes. Has there been a study to analyze the effect of removing bike lanes on these businesses? Will there be a decrease in the number of available runners to deliver the food as some decide its not worth risking their lives to do this job without bike lanes?\nTo improve traffic, it's well known that the best way is to reduce the number of cars by improving public transit and by encouraging alternate modes of transportation such as biking. So the amount of money that will go to removing bike lanes would probably be better spent on public transit. A major area with lots of room for improvement on the TTC is safety.\n"

        "comment": "This provincial government is not acting in the interest of its citizenry, otherwise it would have long realized the absolute folly of its current plans for transporation in Toronto and the GTA.\nThe benefits of car-alternatave means of transport (transit and cycling) have been studied and published ad nauseam, as have the inevitable results of adding more space for cars - induced demand means all of those new highways and lanes will quickly fill with more vehicles, and you're back to attempting to solve the same problem all over again. In enacting legislation allowing the province to remove existing municipal bike lanes, pandering to a small, loud portion of your car-driving constituents, you will be helping no one, both prolonging and amplifying Toronto's existing traffic woes.\nThe financial wastefulness this action entails should be obvious, and yet somehow still needs to be pointed out. In a province where the healthcare and education systems are in shambles, and where the province has dileberately withheld funds earmarked for the former in order to try to garner people's votes via a rebate comprised of their own tax money, destroying existing projects that took considerable time and funds to implement is beyond asinine. Don't think that people outside of the GTA can't see that these petty and frivolous plans are depriving them of funding and services they and their families need and deserve.\nI am also aware that the uproar created by the bike lane portion of this bill is a convenient means to distract from the other portion of it, which allows the removal of certain engineering assessments for the new highway 413. Continue on this trajectory and you will, like so many others, find yourself a victim of your own hubris.\nAll this to say, keep your hands off of Toronto's bike lanes - they're a vital and necessary part of the infrastructure in a rapidly growing and densifying city. Leave the cities to the cities.\n"

        "comment": "As someone who does not bike and cannot do so, bike lanes (especially on Yonge and Bloor, near where I live) have done nothing but improve my life. Infrastructure that supports bicycling supports taking cars off the road, just as infrastructure supporting more frequent mass transit does the same. Drivers who never touch a bike or the TTC are benefitted too -- by sharing the road with fewer drivers. As always, high occupancy transit should be the priority, but bike lanes provide quieter, greener, safer transportation for everyone involved. (And on that point of accidents -- car accidents block *far* more traffic than bike ones ever could, and result in *far* more serious injuries due to the high speed and weight of the bodies involved.) Support more bike lanes, support more car sharing, support more high occupancy transit, and invest in a cleaner, sustainable, more livable Ontario.\n"

Not everyone can afford a private car or can stand spending all day on crowded public transit so having the option to get around the city with relatively more safety THANKS TO the bikes lanes is important. The current provincial government needs to think about the citizens' wellbeing and safety and leave the bikes lanes alone and actually help create more bike lanes where deemed feasible.\n"

        "comment": "Please base your policy actions on real science and data. There has been no analysis done to see what kind of effect these bike lanes are having on traffic. A study in 2011 found that removing bike lanes on Jarvis actually INCREASED traffic. The same thing will happen here.\nI agree that traffic in Toronto needs to be fixed, but less bike lanes is not the solution. One thing that will definitely help, is to time he street lights better. It happens a lot that I'll be biking down Bloor and see a big line up at a red light. However, the next light will be green but nobody is going through as they're all stuck at the red light.\nAnother solution to get cars moving faster is to remove parking! Bloor is a major thoroughfare, there is no reason that we need so much parking on it. If you are absolutely adamant on having 2 lanes of traffic, why not leave the bike lane and remove the parking lane.\nPlease look at solving issues through data and facts, and not simply on emotion.\nFinally, the issue of bike lanes is not a provincial matter. Let cities make their own decisions on this matter. The provincial government has no right to come in and make our cities worse places to live.\n"

        "comment": "I am against Ontario Bill 212 (Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024) for several critical reasons. The proposal to remove bike lanes as a means of reducing traffic congestion is fundamentally flawed and unsupported by evidence. In fact, removing bike lanes will not reduce traffic; studies and historical data have shown the opposite. This measure will likely lead to more accidents and fatalities, ultimately costing the city more in healthcare, emergency services, and legal expenses.\nHistorical data from Toronto highlights this issue clearly. When bike lanes were removed from Jarvis Street in 2011, the city\u2019s own data indicated that travel times increased and traffic slowed, contradicting the intended outcome of easing congestion. Removing bike lanes only serves to endanger cyclists and deter sustainable transportation options, leading to higher reliance on cars and exacerbating gridlock.\nInstead of pursuing policies that endanger lives and diminish the quality of urban infrastructure, the province should focus on investments that directly benefit residents, such as enhancing healthcare and education. This approach would serve the long-term interests of Ontarians far better than dismantling bike lanes to placate drivers and suburban commuters.\nIn summary, Bill 212 is a step backward for Toronto and the province as a whole. Sustainable urban planning should prioritize multimodal transportation solutions that promote safety, efficiency, and environmental responsibility. The government\u2019s focus should be on creating a livable, accessible city for everyone, not just accommodating those who drive into the city for work.\n"
