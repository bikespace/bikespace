        "comment": "We use the Bloor street bike lanes every day, to safely get around the city with our 3 year old daughter. When she is old enough, she will need these bike lanes to get around the city safely on her own. Cars are allotted a massive amount of space in the city already and a small amount of space for cyclists to get around safely is so important to us and to actual residents of Toronto. It makes our lives better and safer. There just isn\u2019t enough space in the city for everyone to commute by car. Improve trains and subways and leave us our bike paths please.\n"

        "comment": "The Ford government\u2019s attempt to override municipal-level planning and infrastructure planning concerning bike lanes is shameful, and should not be tolerated by the people of Ontario.\nNumerous studies have shown the benefits of protected bike lanes, including improved safety for both drivers and cyclists, and economic benefits for improved foot traffic to local businesses.\nThe proposal to reverse the installation of bike lanes on streets is a gross mismanagement of provincial tax dollars and a reprehensible waste of the time, effort, and municipal taxes spent on critical transportation infrastructure. Taxpayers should not tolerate this profoundly wasteful bill.\nFurther, the included provision to reduce the required environmental assessments for construction of another 400-series highway is equally as shameful. The province of Ontario must be forward-thinking, and abandon the plan to build a new highway that would only bring induced demand for more single-occupant drivers. We owe it to our world, and to our children and grandchildren who will inherit this world from us, to be faithful stewards of the environment, and to take every effort to reduce our CO2 emissions and invest instead in sustainable mass transit initiatives.\nAs a resident of Toronto, and a municipal and provincial tax payer, I emphatically oppose this proposed legislation and I would call on every citizen of Ontario to do the same. The Ford government should be ashamed and embarrassed for reinforcing an extremely outdated mindset on how to improve transportation in this province. This legislation is not the way forward, and I call on the current government to withdraw the bill at once.\nSigned,\nA Concerned Citizen of Toronto.\n"

A health biking infrastructure is important for the growing city. It reduces the dependency on car and mass transit.\nIn fact, we should build more bike lines in Toronto so people are less dependent on cars and street will be less congested and safer.\n"

        "comment": "I am in complete favour of taking out the bike lanes on Bloor st. I hope this includes Bloor west up to Islington. The one-lane has been a complete disaster for traffic and has increased my travel time by 10 minutes at least. In addition, with all the markings and barriers and new signage it\u2019s difficult to know where to go and it\u2019s distracting. I find I\u2019m constantly looking everywhere to see where I\u2019m going and when a bike is going to zip by me when I\u2019m turning. Parking is a nightmare.  In the west end there has not been much use of the bike lane and does not justify taking out a whole lane. And when an emergency vehicle needs to get by, it\u2019s impossible to move over because you have those damn barriers. Rip this out! Secondary roads are perfect for bikers.\n"

As someone who has commuted by car, public transit, and bicycle Downtown cores are exactly where lanes dedicated to bikes and other small/personal transportation are needed. As a cyclist, if I am to follow the law putting me on unprotected roads puts me in danger.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are already installed to help protect lives, reduce speeding and protect neighbourhoods, school zones and makes area safer. Removing bike lanes will encourage speeding and reckless driving in these neighbourhoods where commuters only view these roads as thoroughfares roads instead of the actual residents and tax payers who use this infrastructure. If the Premier thinks we are dedicating space for 1% of Cyclers, then I we should technically expand sidewalks as there is a lot of traffic and congestion - it doesn\u2019t make sense to make a road so big for single occupancy vehicles. Or then we should also bulldoze more roads and buildings for mass transit since those carry more commuters than vehicles.\n"

        "comment": "This anti-bike lane bill is a tremendous and egregious waste of tax dollars that will only move Ontario backwards and undo decades of hard work. The removal of the key bike lane corridors (Bloor, Yonge, University) will be undoing the investments spent in building the bike lanes in the first place, spending more money to remove them, and then spending more money to build them somewhere else. This demonstrates a lack of care and complete fiscal irresponsibility. Furthermore, it will lead to the removal of essential transportation infrastructure, removing options from people to get around without the use of a car, reducing accessibility and forcing people to drive which will only increase congestion. It will put people's lives in danger, reducing the safety of some of the most vulnerable road users. It will also result in cars and bikes being forced mixing on the road without separated lanes, slowing down cars. It is a terrible overreach and abuse of power by this provincial government, who should be staying in their lane and focusing on key provincial projects, such as finally opening the overdue Eglinton Crosstown.\n"

        "comment": "I absolutely disagree with the removal of bike lanes on the major streets in Toronto. As a pedestrian who frequently walks those routes and a as someone who also frequently drives along those corridors I feel incredibly safe having those bike lakes. They provide a barrier between the cars and pedestrian and also provide a great space for bikers. I also believe this power should live squarely in the hand of the city and this is an incredible overreach of the province.\n"

However I can't ignore the fact that grid lock has worsened significantly in downtown core, with the lane reducing due to addition of bike lanes. I want to emphasize that driving is a choice and most people who choose to drive because they have to, due to each of their own reasons. I trust that the city council will make the right decision to help people save time and money, by increase the flow of traffic in the city's main arteries.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 prioritizes the perceived inconvenience of drivers over the safety and choice of those opting for alternative transport. Additionally, the bill introduces a redundant bureaucratic layer by requiring provincial government review of bike lane proposals that municipalities\u2014who are more familiar with local needs\u2014have already evaluated and approved. I find Bill 212 unnecessary and am disappointed to see the provincial government allocating resources to defend driver convenience at the expense of others' safety.\n"

        "comment": "I agree that driving in this city has become awful. This is the reason I plan to sell my SUV this month and bike daily. Since side streets don't follow a straight path I will probably just bike on the road. No joke.\nLately while driving I have attempted to stay calm and drive slowly and carefully. This is because I notice that people often speed up to a red light to then have to put on their brakes. We get where we are going to in about the same time all in all.\nBiking has really been picking up interest this past year. Most great cities realize you have to get people more by encouraging people to walk, take public transit or bike. Places that do this have much better driving experiences as well.\nMy suggestion to get people moving is make public transit free everywhere and provide separate lanes for buses/streetcars in large cities. Most would probably take the bus and leave the car.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 is short term thinking at its finest. We do not have enough road capacity for everyone to drive everywhere, all the time. Building out and expanding networks for alternative forms of transportation benefits drivers in the long run by getting other people out of their cars. If you want to drive, please, drive! I'm not interested in telling folks how to get around, but let's make it easier for people to pick other modes of transportation. That means active transportation, walking, and public transit.\nActive transportation networks need to be complete and safe to pull in the general public. Build a complete network that gets folks where they want to go, and cyclists will appear. I only bike routes where I'm separated from drivers because I've seen far too many drivers drive poorly in a way that's dangerous to cyclists and pedestrians. The idea that the Ontario government would go further and rip out finished infrastructure to remove 3 bike lanes in Toronto is the epitome of government waste. I don't even live in Toronto and this sounds fully asinine. Have we really solved all the other major problems facing Ontarians that the government is ready to pay to destroy built infrastructure and add extra layers of red tape for all municipalities? Premier Ford often talks about mayors and municipalities know what's best for their local communities. Why are bike lanes any different such that the Ontario government should stick its nose in municipal jurisdiction? This bill should not pass. Ontarians need a variety of viable transit options so they can choose what is best for them. We do not need the provincial government taking a Queen's Park knows best approach.\n"
