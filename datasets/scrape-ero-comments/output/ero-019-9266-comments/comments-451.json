        "comment": "Hello Mr Ford and Mr Sarkaria,\nI am deeply troubled by this proposed bill from your government. While I doubt that you will take any of these public comments seriously, I hope that maybe this will lead you to have a second thought on this proposal.\nI live in Toronto\u2019s urban core, and use a bike as my primary means of transportation throughout the year (only opting for other means when there is heavy snowfall, which is quite rare even in winter in Toronto). Most of my daily trips are under 3 km, as is the case for most Torontonians. If I was forced to take a car for those short trips due to a lack of safe cycling infrastructure, not only would that be way more expensive (gas, parking, insurance, maintenance\u2026don\u2019t conservatives care about kitchen table economics?) but it would just add to the congestion the city already faces. Imagine if the >5 million bike share trips made every year were cars on the road. Now add everyone else who may not use a bike as a primary means of travel but use one frequently for shorter trips. Now add all the actual bike commuters (not using misrepresented census data like you have in the past). Do you think an extra car lane on three streets would do anything to alleviate the added congestion from those trips being made by car? Why not just eliminate all the on street parking? And again, I would love to see some honest stats from your government. Barely any of the roads in Toronto have a bike lane to begin with. If you took the percentage of taxpayer funded pavement that was dedicated to bike infrastructure in this province, I can assure you it would be infinitesimally smaller than the percentage of people who cycle (and pay taxes too).\nWe simply cannot continue forcing everyone to drive in this city due to a lack of safe and affordable alternatives. It will not help those who ACTUALLY need to travel by car, and will only make those who can\u2019t afford to drive less safe. But hey, what\u2019s the lives of a few \u201curban liberal elite snobby bikers who don\u2019t vote for you\u201d compared to posturing before an election anyways?\nI am also surprised to see a supposedly Conservative government creating more red tape and bureaucracy in this Province, by forcing local road infrastructure planning to be funnelled through the minister\u2019s office. What a ridiculous and inefficient state of affairs that would be. I thought that the best people to make decisions on their local affairs were\u2026locally elected representatives? Isn\u2019t that what conservatives used to believe? Who knows anymore.\nCordially yours,\nProperty Tax Paying Constituent in Toronto\n"

Perhaps give more funding to school boards for mental health initiatives or something similar?\nThere are countless studies that show that bike lanes actually improve traffic flow, reduce pollution, and keep people safe.\nAfter you have removed the bike lanes (I encourage to rethink this), the deaths of cyclists that will occur are squarely on you.

If we were not on bikes, we would likely be contributing to traffic congestion by using a car.\n- In most cases, removing these lanes would not actually create an additional lane for traffic.\n- Please use updated, Toronto-focused statistics when building a case for your proposals.\n- Also, this should be a municipal issue not a provincial one\n- Finally, stop using an issue of citizen safety as a way to play to your conservative base -- its transparent and corrupt\n"

        "comment": "I think this piece of legislation is a mistake. The name of \"Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act\" seems suspect to me as it only focuses on removing bike lanes \"where the removal of a lane of traffic took place\" only. This is odd as there is no language in the bill considering if adding or removing a bike lane will actually reduce congestion. It's surprising that the Government of Ontario would meddle in a matter that is normally up to the Toronto council to decide when they make no mention of using traffic data to decide on if bike lanes should be removed.\nAs simple example, if bikes are currently in bike lanes, they are out of the way of traffic. The removal of such bike lanes will mean they are now in amongst traffic. Now cars have to slow down (as bikes are generally slower than cars) causing congestion. Now bikes being on the road instead of in bike lanes has caused congestion, as even the lane that was already there has cars swerving into it to avoid the cyclists. Do the authors of this bill simply imagine that those that cycle already will just go away, they removing the problem of cyclists slowing down cars?\n\"Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act\" would surely be better served by reducing the need for people to use cars. One bike takes up significantly less space than a car. 80 bikes in a bike lane makes the bike lane look almost empty, but 80 cars (as most people do not car share) fills up even a 2 lane road quite handely.\nAccording to urban planners (i.e. experts in getting cities to work efficiently) \"Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time\" can be most effectively done by reducing the number of cars on the road by increasing use of public transport and bikes. There is no data to suggest that simply removing bike lanes to allow for more car lanes decreases gridlock. Actually, the data suggests the opposite.\nI hope the Government of Ontario will reconsider this rediculous policy, and get back to actually fixing the problems that we are facing such as the housing crysis going on in Toronto and forcing local municipalities to build more housing where it is sorely needed.\n"

        "comment": "As a nurse, avid traveller, and overall human I can't stress the importance enough of having bike lanes in the city.  Look to Copenhangen, Paris and even Montreal to see how bike lanes have improved circulation in a city, and I would even bet, decreased hospitalizations as a result of bike injuries.  To go backwards and remove bike lanes is short sighted. The proposed removal of bike lanes along Bloor, University and Yonge is the wrong move.  Cyclists will continue to ride those streets regardless, leading to unsafe commutes for cyclists and drivers alike.  Culture change takes time, and if the city continues to ADD more lanes, more opportunities for people to access bikes quickly (Bixi bikes) slowly more people will ride, but the roads need to be SAFER to do that. If you want to reduce congestion, look to others as inspiration.  I do not support this bill.\nMy question here is: does it even matter what the public thinks?  Or will this continue regardless of many who will disagree with it?\n"

        "comment": "I am beyond disappointed.\nThe proposed restrictions on future bike lanes and the removal of existing lanes will make traffic worse, commuting more expensive and ultimately people will die because of it.\nAlternative modes of transportation such as walking, and cycling are absolutely essential. The stubborn focus on cars and the disregard for reality is frankly astounding.\nCars are huge. Geometrically there simply is not enough space in cities for everyone to drive. It doesn't matter how many paths and parks you demolish and pave, there will NEVER be enough space for everyone to drive. This has been known for decades. Removing alternatives forces more people to drive which will immediately overwhelm any new capacity and end up making the problem worse (which has been shown time and time again in studies looking at induced demand).\nCars are expensive. By removing affordable options like cycling you are forcing people to pay huge amounts of money for vehicles. Car payments, gas, insurance, vehicle maintenance, road maintenance. Do people really need to own 2 tons of steel and bring it with them to work every day? Of course not! Putting aside the societal and health costs associated with complete car dependence, removing the option of cycling effectively imposes huge financial burdens on everyone who must now purchase a car.\nSafety. I often hear about cyclists being unsafe or interacting with traffic in ways that drivers find unsafe. But really, it is the involvement of cars that make things unsafe. If you were walking down the sidewalk and a child stepped in front of you, would you be furious and declare that the sidewalks are unsafe? Of course not. But if you are driving a car, the stakes are raised and this situation becomes one of life and death. Do you really want to force more people into life or death situations every single day?\nDrivers are angry about times they have had to interact with cyclists. The answer is obvious: give cyclists somewhere else to be. Providing bike lanes gives cyclists space separate from cars which greatly reduces these interactions. Removing bike lanes will force cyclists to mix with traffic and/or pedestrians which will cause more of these conflict, more animosity between road users and more injuries and death.\nIn some statements, low bike lane usage is used to imply that they are not needed and are a waste of space. This is factually incorrect at best and a deliberate manipulation at worst. The existing bike networks are woefully inadequate. Bike lanes are incomplete and randomly just end, forcing cyclists into traffic. Or poor connectivity means people cannot reach destinations by bike and so they feel that driving is the only option. You cannot dismiss the need for a bridge because no one ever swims across the river. Quite simply, the network is incomplete and pathetic. You cannot dismiss the entire idea of bike lanes because a half-baked, poorly executed version of the idea is not instantly more popular than decades of car-centric infrastructure specifically designed to discourage cycling. Imagine if 90% of the car lanes magically disappeared and the remaining lanes were broken up and disconnected, would it be fair to say that nobody wants to drive, and thus remaining roads should be removed? Of course not. That is a ridiculous, inaccurate and unfair assumption.\nIf the goal is to reduce traffic, the answer is simple, there needs to be fewer vehicles on the road. Yet removing bike lanes removes an alternative means of transportation and forces more cars onto the road which will make things worse. I don't know what the actual reason for wanting to remove bike lanes is. Is it personal prejudice? Stubborn wilful ignorance? Was a cyclist rude to you one time? Do you stand to gain personally? I don't know. But one this is clear, the proposal to limit and/or remove bike lanes is not based on reality, evidence, or the best interests of the citizens of Ontario.\nI urge you to looks at the data. Look to European cities who have embraced bike lanes and improved the lives of their citizens as a result.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes increase bike ridership and remove cars from the road. By adding more bike lanes, bike ridership will go up and car ridership will go down. This is observable in any community in Toronto with a well established series of biking lanes. This is the same in areas where there is a reliable cohesive system of public transit. Ask anyone that used to live in Toronto before the addition of bike lanes and they will tell you how atrocious the traffic used to be.\nThe reason we are given is that this will be done to increase traffic flow. By that logic why not remove sidewalks? Why not add lanes through buildings? Maybe we should remove historic buildings within the city core and replace it with a new express way? Those that suffer in traffic should consider advocating for better transit, something that could be reasonably achieved with a government that actually puts the needs of the people first. The provincial government is needlessly adding red tape and interfering with a system that the City of Toronto has been perfecting over time.\nThis move by the province will only make the roads more dangerous, increase traffic, and make driving in the city even more of a night mare. Removing bike lanes moves Toronto backwards by decades and will devastate Toronto socially and financially for years to come.\n"

        "comment": "As an avid cyclist and a driver, I'm fully in support of Bill 212.  Frustrating drivers with clogged roads does not make the roads safer for anyone.  Increasing idling times of vehicles caught in traffic also increases green house gas emissions creating an environmental impact.  I have an example of a project that is about to start in Ottawa that I hope you can stop before any tax dollars are wasted.\nIn Ottawa, the Bank Street bridge that crosses the Rideau River currently has four lanes for traffic.  The number of vehicle lanes are soon to be reduced to add bike lanes.  The vehicle lane reductions will not only cause traffic to back up on Bank St. but the implementation will impact traffic at the Bank St. and Riverside Drive intersection.  City engineers estimate that the commute time on Riverside Dr. will increase by 2 to 3 minutes.  That's 2 to 3 minutes for thousands of cars stuck idling on Riverside drive every day in rush hour.  The impact will extend beyond Bank St. and Riverside Dr. into smaller neighbourhood streets as drivers seek alternate routes.\nPlease use Bill 212 to stop the Bank St. Billings Bridge lane reductions.\n"

        "comment": "Hello.\nI strongly oppose this bill for the following two reasons, and I am extremely upset that it is being proposed.\nReason 1:\n- bike lanes reduce gridlock by providing non-driving alternatives. This is what the extensive literature on bike lanes and transportation modelling shows. I bike in Toronto instead of driving. I do so with my baby. but I will not do so on unsafe roads without bike lanes. I will take other forms of transportation instead, adding to congestion.\nReason 2:\n- the Province of Ontario should not be interfering in municipal affairs. Why is the legislature's time being wasted on an issue that has been delegated to Toronto (like all municipalities) instead of serving people across the province. The city is going to fight this and make it unpleasant. I don't even necessarily believe the province will succeed. Is the ministry of transportation now going to be wasting its time fighting with the city, instead of delivering on the already over time and over budget transit projects? What a waste.\n"
