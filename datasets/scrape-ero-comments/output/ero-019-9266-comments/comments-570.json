I've seen them stuck in the gridlock. There are a VERY FEW cyclists that use these new bike lanes and so many drivers get stuck in non-moving or creeping traffic that is polluting our air. Cross streets are also gridlocked at busy times. Even fewer bicyclists will use these lanes in winter. And hey, will you now need new equipment to plough these lanes in winter? Taking away drivers' lanes both ways was a stupid, stupid decision.\n"

The $48 million cost is not worth it and the city study indicates that the removal would not actually improve traffic times. From an environmental perspective it would be construction and disruption with the waste and pollution that entails for no benefit. It also prioritizes cars most of which are still run by burning fossil fuels. It is the opposite of the direction we should be going.\n"

        "comment": "Dear Members of Provincial Parliament of the Standing Committee on Heritage, Infrastructure and Cultural Policy,\nMy name is x and I'm a resident of the [y] area. My family does not own a car and we rely on safe bike infrastructure in the city of Toronto to get us safely to our destination. Not having to own a car has saved us more than $10,000 a year and we rely on urban cycling as our main form of transportation.\nBill 212 with its proposal to rip out bike lanes on University, Bloor and Yonge street and to delay new bike infrastructure is going to make my and my family's commute a lot more dangerous and unreliable. In Toronto this year, we've had 6 cyclists die and just in the last 2 weeks, a 13 year old girl died riding her bike in Ajax (1) , while another woman died in Kingston riding her bike (2). Clearly there's not enough cycling infrastructure across Ontario despite the high demand for cycling across the province. It is not only people in downtown Toronto who bike, just last weekend I wrote to the Honourable Logan Kanapathico about the high demand for cycling in his region (see attached photo at the end)\nNow that Bill 212 is being reviewed by you, I urge you to reconsider this regressive piece of legislation. In the age of climate change, we should be encouraging more people to seek driving alternatives, as mentioned in Ontario's climate change website (3) and make it easier to bike with safe infrastructure. Cycling is a low cost form of transportation that Ontarians like me are relying on and the Ford government, with its mantra of saving the taxpayers' money should not be making our lives more expensive.\nKind regards, My name and Contact info\nSources:\n1 - https://toronto.citynews.ca/2024/11/07/ajax-cyclist-struck-13-year-old-\u2026\n2 - https://ottawa.ctvnews.ca/kingston-ont-woman-riding-electric-bicycle-di\u2026\n3 - https://www.ontario.ca/page/climate-change\nphoto - https://imgur.com/a/AuzL7Kd\n"

        "comment": "Creating more lanes will not fix our traffic problem. Bike lanes encourage other modes of transportation that is safe and accessible. Invest in public transportation that is reliable and fast to encourage people to use, not encourage more cars on the road. This is proven research and executed successfully in many countries. This will encourage tourism and benefit workers out of city workers as well. If bike lanes are removed, bikers will either be on roads with cars that will slow down traffic or be on sidewalks that is dangerous for pedestrians. We have already paid so much money to install bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "By reducing lanes of vehicular traffic by 50 % on major arteries has significantly increased the number of vehicles that are now using residential streets to avoid the congestion on the major arteries. These residential streets often do not have sidewalks and thus put the safety of pedestrians at greater risk. All major arteries have designated sidewalks.\nBy encouraging vehicles to bypass the major arteries, the increased noise and air pollution in residential neighbourhoods decreases the desire to live there. Homeowners have chosen to reside in such areas with the belief that their streets would not be impacted so dramatically.\nWe pay our property taxes with the understanding that our streets would not be subject to such drastic measures. Is it not much more desirable to place bike lanes on residential streets where the safety of cyclists, pedestrians and homeowners is the key concern. This in face does not discourage cycling but will make it more desirable on a safety and environmental basis.\nMajor arteries need to continued to be used for effective traffic flow. The congestion currently created by reducing four lanes to two lanes to vehicles, and using the other two lanes for bicycles does not make sense. These lanes are made up of many types of obstruction - it is not a smooth ride by any means - the curves, the bus ramps, debris (including leaves), snow and ice. As such their maintenance is hampered   Let us also remember that we live in a climate where it is much less desirable to cycle in the winter. What is the actual use during the different season? Even in the more desirable months, the number of cyclist is very minimal. Let us move these bike lanes to a residential street.\nIn addition, this reduced traffic flow causes an impasse to emergency vehicles. Each minute lost in congestion as a result of no accessible lane can result in tragedy to a city resident. By placing physical barriers in place, the street is truly only functioning as a two lane street, and thereby the possible maintenance of the bike lanes. It also creates much more ineffective use of time and money in keeping the two lanes for cars safe. Is the well-being of city residents, whether on foot, bike or car the most important consideration. Let us use the major arteries with full vehicular access and sidewalks and use residential streets for bike lanes. Health and safety for all.\n"

        "comment": "I am fully supportive of the proposed legislation that will mandate the removal of \"hard\" bike lanes on major arteries such as Bloor Street West in Etobicoke and University Avenue in Toronto.  Those lanes endanger public safety, cause environmental harm, economic harm and add to the gridlock choking Toronto.\nThe simple, painted bike lanes present in many cities including Toronto make perfect sense but the unique, unsightly 'hard', dedicated bike lanes, protected by vertical posts and cement barriers which were recently installed along Bloor West and other major arteries are a disaster.\nProponents of these hardened bike lanes claim, incredibly, that their installation is not responsible for any of their obvious negative impacts including worsened gridlock.  But \"the science is settled\", to coin a phrase:  The removal of 50% of anything usually has observable impacts. In this case, the dramatic narrowing of Bloor Street West from South Kingsway to Kipling from four lanes to two in order to permit the installation of little-used hardened bike lanes has easily observable negative impacts.\nFirst, and most seriously, they harm public safety:  fire, police and emergency services vehicles' response times have increased as a direct result of the bike lane installations on Bloor.  These vehicles, sirens blaring, lights flashing, are trapped in the gridlock caused by the hardened bike lanes, unable to move.  They cannot get through because on lengthy stretches of the route there is nowhere for vehicles in front of them to pull over:  traffic can no longer pull far enough to the right to allow fire trucks, police and ambulances to get through:  They are blocked by the cement bike lane barriers.\nLonger emergency response times that endanger lives and property on a daily basis are not a reasonable price to pay for bike lanes.\nThe restrictive design of the hardened bike lanes also endangers those trying to park in the bizarrely-relocated parking lane on Bloor:  it is now in the middle of what used to be a lane of traffic.  Instead of being next to the sidewalk, the parking lane is now a narrow space sandwiched between the remaining lane of traffic on the left and a hardened bike lane on the right.  Ironically, these parking lanes are also dangerous to the few cyclists who use the lanes.  People attempting to exit a parked car on the left, (drivers' side) are much greater risk of being struck by a passing car and those exiting on the right hand side of the car are now at risk of being struck by a cyclist.\nOr, they could be struck by an electric skateboard or scooter user in the bike lane, and there are actually more people on those devices using the 'bike lanes' on Bloor than pedal-powered cyclists.  These electric vehicles travel about 40 kms an hour in the bike lane, usually faster than car and truck traffic on the adjacent roadway.\nAnd of course, cyclists/scooter/skateboard users are also risk serious injury or worse when they impact a person or a car door that has opened into the bike lane from the narrow parking lane.\nSecond, far from decreasing negative environmental impacts, the bike lanes in question have increased them.  Vehicles, the vast majority powered by gasoline, now spend more time stewing in gridlock than previously, inching along, spewing exhaust gases into surrounding neighbourhoods.\nMany drivers, impatient with the gridlock, are now diverting through those same neighbourhoods, desperately looking for ways to reduce the amount of time trapped in traffic.\nThird, the logical result of installing hardened bike lanes on a major artery such as Bloor is an increase in gridlock, which now occurs not only east and westbound on Bloor for much of the day, from Islington to South Kingsway, but also north and southbound on Royal York Road, from earlier in the morning to later in the evening.  This unavoidable 'collateral gridlock\" sees traffic regularly backed up on Royal York south of Bloor from that street to Norseman and north of Bloor nearly to Dundas, even at 2:30 in the afternoon.  The constrictions on Bloor have, logically, led to the north-south backups on Royal York because left and right turns from Royal York onto Bloor take longer, just as travel along Bloor takes longer.  It's not rocket science:  It's bike lane science.\nGridlock affects everyone, not just drivers in private vehicles.  Everyone who depends on the TTC buses on Royal York, including students and workers are also unfairly and unreasonably impacted by the hardened bike lanes used by very few.  Does the city really need to make the lives of TTC bus travellers harder and more inconvenient?\nFor all the above reasons, it is sadly necessary for the Ontario government to act to undo the harm done by Toronto City Council.  In a city beset by inadequate public transit and gridlock, the decision to further restrict and choke access to the city by the nefarious installation of hardened bike lanes on major arteries is incomprehensible.\nThe mayor and councillors should take note of some recent advice from Alberta NDP Leader Naheed Nenshi.  Although he was not, of course, referring to bike lanes in Toronto, his views on the role of government generally are worth following:\n\u201cI believe government should try to solve the biggest problems that affect the largest number of people.\u201d\nFinally, complaints about the cost of removing the hardened bike lanes pales in comparison to the costs of not removing them.  In addition to the easily observable health and environmental impacts, the economic costs to businesses along the route are significant.\n"

        "comment": "I oppose this proposal. Aside from being a waste of taxpayer dollars, removal of the bike lanes is a reversal of efforts to encourage citizens to choose alternative modes of transportation to automobiles. Disincentivization of driving in the city core is surely a more rational way to reduce gridlock and air pollution.  Additionally, the province's resources should be directed towards addressing matters that effect all residents of the province, such as continuing to expand public transit and affordable housing. It is inappropriate for the province to interfere in affairs such as bike lanes which are clearly under municipal jurisdiction.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 is not a good bill for the people of Ontario:\n- bike lanes save lives, help improve congestion (bikes in the car lane slow down cars), ease pressure on transit, and are good for business as more people stop and shop. The data shows this, and we should be making data driven decisions, not those based on emotion.\n- the answer to solving congestion is not to build more car lanes. That is unsustainable and not future focused - the population of Toronto is continuing to grow, and the amount of car lanes we can build is limited. We have to invest in alternative means of transit, and we have to be doing this now. If we continue to build for cars only, we will be making the problem worse in the future.\n- I do not usually get involved in local matters, but these bike lanes are important to me. I personally have gotten involved with canvassing efforts with Cycle TO, to ask people on the street to sign the petition to keep the bike lanes. It's rare you stand in one place and see just how many cyclists go past, but I was very impressed with how many people rely on these lanes, even in cold mid November weather. It was an incredibly diverse group, racially, young and old, and even people with kids. I spoke with both cyclists and pedestrians, and I would say about 90% of people I talked to were in favor of the bike lanes, it was rare to find people who wanted them removed. It's clear to me that the city of Toronto wants these lanes.\n- It is a giant waste of money to remove existing infrastructure. This says to me that the people behind this proposal are not competent when it comes to spending funds.\n- The municipalities should have the ability to make decisions about their area and what's best for their people. The province does not have the resources or local knowledge to be making these decisions, all it is doing is adding another layer of bureaucracy to the process, as well as the associated cost. Again, not a wise financial decision.\n- I also dislike that bill 212 allows highways to be built without Environmental Assessments. This is incredibly important, and affects so many things, like our water, our forestry, our wildlife. Again, without these considerations, we are creating a worse future. It is also completely unreasonable that the province is proposing the ability to kick people out of their homes without notice to build these highways - this is an unacceptable level of power the province is asking for.\nOverall, this bill is extremely concerning, and the facts just don't stack up positively in any way, there is absolutely no data to suggest these are smart decisions. If the people behind this bill truly believe that this is the way forward, then it's incredibly clear to me that they are not competent enough to be making decisions for the people of Ontario.\n"
