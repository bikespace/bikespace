        "comment": "The decision by this government to arbitrarily impose restrictions on how municipalities manage their transportation infrastructure is a gross overreach. Municipal review of their transportation needs by experienced staff supersedes the political ideology of an arms reach party. Bike lanes are essential to reducing traffic congestion in municipalities. Without a SAFE means of biking people will gravitate back into cars or use active lanes of traffic while biking. This will increase congestion and slow vehicle movement. Instead of spending unnecessary time and our tax dollars on fighting an imaginary \u201cwar on the car\u201d, efforts should be made to improve alternative transportation options rather than personal vehicles.\n"

Removing thr bike lanes means thst cyclists and motor vehicles must share the right of way which has thr same impact on traffic flow as reduced lanes.\nThr Kingsway stretch of bloor street is inconvenient for me to travel to on foot.  IF I'm forced to take the subway to the Kingsway, I'm probably going to travel right past it instead.   The Kingsway feels like a small ontario town built on a highway with little reason to visit other than it's the only thing in town.  It needs something to bring people to the area and make them want yo stay and shop.   Bike lanes may not be the answer but it's a start.  Treating bloor street like a highway with street parking is NOT the answer.\n"

As a driver I am much happier to see cyclists off the road where there is no chance I can hit them.\nI know that having bike lanes (especially protected ones) reduces traffic in the long run. I fear this new act will increase traffic in already congested roads and so defeat its purpose. I do not support this act and think the provinces time and money is better spent elsewhere.\n"

        "comment": "I live and work in downtown Toronto. I strongly object to the passing of this bill for the following reasons:\n- The removal of bicycle infrastructure will drastically increase the dangers faced by cyclists downtown by putting them in the same lanes as cars. Far too many cyclists are seriously injured or killed on the roads of Ontario already. The provincial government should be looking to IMPROVE the safety of its residents not put them into harms way. regardless of whether the provincial government think the existence of bike lanes affects the travel time of someone else in a car, that cyclist deserves to be safe.\n- Faced with the decision to drive or take a bike, if there is a safe, protected bike lane I will take a bike. All year long. Without a protected bike lane I would likely drive. My car would take up much more room and cause much more congestion than my bike. It would currently take me 45 minutes to get to work by car, 20 minutes by bike, and an hour by ttc. This also means that if I were to drive I would be causing congestion in this city for 25 minutes longer than by biking. MORE bike lanes would REDUCE congestion.\n- Given that we are living in a climate emergency I would hope that any effort to reduce the reliance on cars should be taken. Bike lanes make sense both from an emissions standpoint as well as a space standpoint. the less infrastructure we need to build to support cars the better.\n- Please focus on getting mass transit running instead of destroying one of the very few quick ways to get around the city.\n"

        "comment": "To whom it may concern,\nI live in Waterloo Region, and my municipality has spent the last decade (and more) carefully planning investments in both transit and active transportation to create a city that people want to live in, as evidenced by it being the percentage-wise second-fastest growing CMA in 2023. It would be a huge detriment to our regional planning and growth to put more bureaucracy in-between the region and its implementation of the official plan that has been working quite well over the last decade.\nPlease abandon this proposal. Here in KW we can see the transit/active transportation strategy starting to work, and starting to reduce congestion by keeping cars off the road. It is very important that we let the strategy play out. Managing congestion as our population grows will be more about giving people reasonable alternatives to cars, and sometimes that requires tradeoffs against car lanes, but our region is doing an excellent job managing those tradeoffs now, and they should be allowed to continue unabated.\n"

If you go through with this you will be accountable for the excess deaths in the road. This policy won\u2019t even solve the congestion issue. It may improve temporarily but demand by car use will only just catch up and surpass capacity again. The only sensible thing to do is to create more options for people to get around which includes cycling. There are so many benefits to personal health, air quality, climate change and the vibrancy of our cities. Please just let municipalities and the people decide what\u2019s best.\n"

        "comment": "I am a centrist voter and want to chime in with my thoughts.\nRemoving bike lanes is not a viable solution to reducing traffic gridlock. In fact, it could worsen the problem by encouraging more car use and reducing transportation options for commuters. Cities worldwide have increasingly recognized that relying solely on cars leads to congestion, pollution, and inefficient land use. Bike lanes provide an alternative, allowing cyclists to travel safely and reducing the number of vehicles on the road. Removing them eliminates that option, forcing more people back into cars (their own, or Ubers), which exacerbates traffic issues rather than alleviating them.\nMoreover, bike lanes promote a more sustainable and efficient urban environment. They are part of a broader strategy to reduce traffic congestion by encouraging active transportation. Cyclists take up far less space than cars, and when more people bike, there\u2019s less demand for parking and less congestion overall. Cities like Amsterdam and Copenhagen have shown that prioritizing bike infrastructure leads to more efficient transportation networks, where roads are used by a variety of modes, each suited to different travel needs. Removing bike lanes takes away this opportunity and perpetuates car dependency.\nStudies have shown that bike lanes reduce congestion.  As a voter, I want decisions made based on evidence and common sense, not knee-jerk reactions to problems and culture war issues.\nI am also disgusted by the provincial government's overreach in trying to tell cities what to do with their own roads.  This is an abuse of power and not in line with conservatism.\nMy vote in the next election will be decided on whether issues like this keep being prioritized or if real change is made.\n"

These lanes have significantly improved my daily commute to downtown, offering a safe and efficient way to travel.\nUsing the bike lanes has not only benefited my personal health but has also contributed to reducing traffic congestion and promoting a cleaner environment. Studies have shown that bike lanes enhance safety for cyclists and motorists alike, leading to fewer accidents overall.\nRemoving or reducing these vital lanes would undermine the progress we\u2019ve made toward a more sustainable and accessible transportation system. I urge you to reconsider any plans to eliminate bike lanes and instead focus on maintaining and improving them for the benefit of our community.\nThank you for considering my perspective.\n"

I drive a taxi in the city and at peak hours I count merely dozens of cyclists on each street downtown. I have become very observant of this over the past year and make it a note to keep track of cyclist volume. We have extremely minimal cyclists in this city.\nIn the winter not a single bike is in site. All these lanes do is create significantly more traffic and make driving unsafe with narrow lanes.\nPlease start by removing the lanes on Rideau, Wellington and O'Connor.\n"

It seems sad that our children don't feel safe biking in their own neighbourhood.\nI strongly urge you to reconsider this legislation. The changes you are proposing are strongly opposed by the communities they most directly affect.\n"
