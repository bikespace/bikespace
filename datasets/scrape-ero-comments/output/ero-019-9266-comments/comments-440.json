We should be encouraging alternate forms of transit and not encourage more driving and cars stuck on the road. In my experience biking there is a way bigger feeling of safety when the bike lane is there and makes us feel like we belong on the road rather than have to contend with cars that can be dangerous.\n"

While some argue that bike lanes contribute to traffic congestion, I believe this is a positive trade-off if it encourages more people to choose bikes or other small vehicles over cars. For example, before biking, I used to take the bus\u2014until construction delays led me to try cycling, which turned out to be faster. Since then, I use my bike whenever I can.\nAlthough I\u2019m currently in high school outside the downtown core, where recent lane removals (like those on Yonge and Bloor) don\u2019t impact me directly, I plan to bike to university in Toronto. These routes will be essential to my future commute and to the next generation growing up in the city. I urge the city to preserve and improve bike lanes, promoting sustainable transportation options for a greener future.\n"

        "comment": "To whom it may concern,\nI strongly oppose the passing of Bill 212. While I do support the effort of reducing congestion in our great city, I do not support increasing red tape and destroying infrastructure that provide a valuable means of transport for many people. This bill flies in the face of known methods of reducing congestion. It has been shown, through multiple studies over several decades, that adding car lanes offers diminishing returns in reducing congestion. In fact at a certain point adding lanes will only increase congestion.\nWhat has been shown to improve congestion, is providing viable alternatives to driving. Whether it be busses, trains/trams, or bike lanes. I am a proud car owner, of a perky Hyundai Veloster in vitamin C orange to be exact. But, even I cannot deny that bicycles are a far more space efficient, fiscally responsible, healthier, and considerate means of transportation.\nI currently live in North York, so the removal of the Bloor, Younge, and University bike lanes would likely not affect my life very much. However, perhaps unlike the writers of this bill, I can empathize with the people who it will affect. I can also say that I would greatly appreciate the construction of bike infrastructure in my part of the city. I'm sure that Don Mills, Leslie, and Bayview between Eglinton and Sheppard could greatly benefit from bike lanes. If this bill passes, North York will never see a network of bike infrastructure, and it will instead remain a shabby patchwork, which would be an incredible waste of opportunity.\nI suppose it needn't be said that if this bill passes, I will strongly reconsider ever voting for this administration. And I'll be sure to encourage others to do the same. Let it be known that my vote will go to an administration that supports logical infrastructure supported by real world case studies, rather than the lunacy of a group who cannot fathom the concept of getting outside and using their legs.\nSincerely,\nA concerned resident of Toronto\n"

        "comment": "I have lived in Toronto's West End for 24 years, biking the whole time. I appreciate the bike lanes so much, especially the Bloor crosstown, championed by the late Tooker Gomberg. It makes my daily commute much safer than driving with cars. My partner and kids also use the bike lanes, which are the only safe path for them on Toronto streets, in my opinion. I also drive a car, and while I hate the slow traffic throughout Toronto, REMOVING EXISTING BIKELANES IS NOT THE SOLUTION! Studies have shown that more lanes for cars results in more cars. Having a bike lane reserved for cyclists encourages biking and LESS DRIVING. This is obvious, and Toronto only needs to look to more progressive cities like Amsterdam to see how bike travel is the safer, quicker, non-polluting way to get around downtown Toronto. Establishing existing bikelanes, narrow and few as they are, has been a long struggle by biking advocates and NEED TO BE PROTECTED for everyone's safety, and reduction of polluting fossil fuel emissions! Spending more taxpayer money to destroy crucial infrastructure is one of the most backward ideas this Provincial Government has ever had, and there have been many.\n"

While I myself commute to work through automobile, and rarely cycle for recreation, I can see how this bill does nothing to alleviate the issues it purports to solve.\nThe science clearly shows that enhancing cycling infrastructure decreases traffic congestion over time by offering an alternative to driving. Cycling infrastructure takes vehicles off the road, while simultaneously improving public health, and reducing noise and air pollution. On the other hand, building automobile infrastructure without providing viable alternatives actually increases congestion through induced demand. Not only that, but this bill clearly oversteps the municipalities rights to make its own decisions regarding its design. This bill is really abhorrent in many ways, and I truly hope it doesn't go through.\nSigned - A 25 year old who's vote isn't for sale for $200.\n"

        "comment": "I am opposed to this bill and to the province banning or ordering removal of bike lanes. Taking control of bike lanes is an unfair and ill-advised intrusion on municipal matters, threatens the safety of cyclists and pedestrians, and would result in fewer people biking and more people driving cars, which would make cities less livable and worsen climate change.\nI am 62 years old and live in old Toronto. Cycling is my main mode of transportation, and has been since before I gave up my car in 1992. Before bike lanes, getting around was a lot more dangerous. Twice, parked cars opened their doors into me and I fell onto the roadway. All I could think of was whether a passing car would run me over.\nSimply put, bikes are not cars. In a contest between the two, it will always be the cyclist who gets injured and killed while the driver walks away unscathed. Cyclists need protection.\nSince bike lanes have gone in, I feel a lot safer. I rarely have to cycle close to parked cars on main streets. I live just a few houses from Bloor Street and so use the Bloor St bike lanes almost every day.\nGridlock is a real issue, and I support intelligent ways to address it. But ripping up bike lanes is not intelligent. It ignores all the studies showing they have a positive impact on the safety of both bikers and pedestrians, are good for business, and make cities more pleasant. They do slow cars down, but not by much. They do not negatively impact emergency response times. Simply put, bike lanes are being unfairly targeted for political reasons.\nThe city of Toronto spent many years studying, trying different approaches and designs, and receiving feedback from its citizens to get to where we are now. For the Province to undo this work for political reasons is simply untenable.\nWords cannot express how important this is to me.\n"

        "comment": "Please read the entire comment. Thank you.\nI will not provide any supporting documentation or links as I am sure many others will. I assume that you, as government officials, are already well informed on this subject and on this bill. If you are not already well informed, you should be. It is easy to research the topic of traffic congestion and the like. There are a lot of data and well regarded studies and the conclusions are clear. I will let you come to your own conclusions on this topic. It appears you already have - research or not. I will say here that I do not support this bill, I do not support the construction of highway 413, I do not support the removal of any bike lanes, and I'll also throw in here that I do not support the construction, or even the study, of a tunnel under the 401 highway. I do not appreciate my tax dollars, and the tax dollars of my fellow Ontarians, being spent wastefully in ways that will not solve a single problem. Non of this spending will improve traffic and non of it will improve the standard of living and quality of life of the citizens of Ontario. Again, do your research. It is clear. And, there are more pressing issues that we are facing as a province that the government should be focusing on with every resource.\nAll the spending in this bill is designed to put more cars on the road. More cars going to the same places. To the same places that are already congested. More cars. That's all that this spending will do. More cars everywhere. Good luck finding a parking spot when you finally get somewhere. But, you and I both know this bill has nothing to do with improving traffic. It's political.\nYou can't improve traffice by putting more cars on the road. So, what is your plan for having fewer cars on the road? Pick a street, any street, in Toronto. Bloor street, Yonge, Dufferin, Avenue, Queen, you name it. What's your plan for having fewer cars on it? Unfortunately, that's what I thought.\nI am a reasonable human being. I do not have any political leaning. The way our politics is being practiced today is shameful across the board. It's embarrassing and pathetic actually. It's become a stupid game. A game that solves no problems, ignores big ones, and creates new ones. I am glad that each passing day gets me closer to death because our politics is killing me.\nI am a successful middle aged Torontonian. I am also an active and healthy Torontonian. I actually try to be a good person. My commute to the office is roughly 16km each way. Sometimes I drive to and from work - I'm a driver! Sometimes I cycle to and from work - wait, I'm a cyclist! Sometimes I work at home - what, what am I! And, sometimes I drive and cycle to and from other places - wow!\nTell me, when you remove the bike lanes, where will all the bikes go. Well, let me tell you where they'll all go. It's not new. We've been here before. Well, actually, we're still here, we never left - because there aren't enough bike lanes. But that's another conversation. Take me for example, when the bike lanes are removed and I am on my bike, I will be in traffic slowing down all the cars. That is, all the cars that are too afraid to pass a bike. There are a lot of drivers afraid to pass a bike. I see them everywhere. And those cars hold up traffic. Then there are the drivers who don't care about bikes. They will just zoom by cyclists without a care in the world. That is, until one of them finally hits a bike, and injures or kills a cyclist. What happens after you remove the bike lane on Bloor street and a cyclist gets killed on Bloor street? Is the province ready for those law suits. The reason that cyclist is dead is because the province removed the bike lane.\nAnd, continuing with the answer, when I am in my car, all the bikes will be in traffic slowing me and others down. You have to be careful sharing the road with cars and bikes. The roads will be dangerous for cyclists and annoying for motorists because they can't pass a bike or a car that can't pass a bike. And, then, there are plenty of cyclists who will purposely take a whole lane of traffic, as they are legally able to do, just to give a big middle finger to the province. It's already annoying when cyclists do that. I don't do it. But start removing bike lanes and well, I probably will. Because that's just how upsetting this is.\nAnd what about the months, if not years, of traffic while the construction to remove the bike lanes is going on. Can't wait for that. That should be fun. I'm sure when all of this is done, we'll all be getting everywhere faster. Right. Are you going to measure traffic times before and after the removal to see if there is actually an improvement? I'm sure you won't. But don't bother. It's obvious. There won't be any improvement.\nI know none of the comments posted here will change anything. It appears your agenda is carved in stone. Our democracy at work. Our government making life worse. Oh, how delightful it would be to see the government actually change course after public feedback. You can delete this now and erase it from your memory.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing as a concerned citizen of Burlington, and High School Student, regarding the recently proposed Bill 212. This bill, which mandates provincial approval for bike lanes directly impacts those of us who rely on safe, dedicated cycling routes for essential transportation. As someone who commutes exclusively by bicycle due to my current G2 license status, the lack of accessible, protected cycling infrastructure poses a real safety risk. My bike is my primary mode of transportation, from attending school and visiting the mall to traveling to nearby areas such as Hamilton and Watertown. Existing infrastructure, like the Plains Road bike lane in Burlington, demonstrates the positive changes bike lanes can bring to our community, yet significant gaps and dangers remain. For instance, navigating crossings on major highways, like the 401, can be both challenging and unsafe in addition to many drivers being very dangerous and threatening to drive me off the road.  Bill 212 not only threaten to dismantle the progress made but also limit municipalities' ability to prioritize sustainable and safe cycling options for residents. The removal of lanes on Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue in Toronto as stipulated in the bill raises concerns about whether other cities, including Burlington, will see their own bike lanes removed in the name of traffic efficiency. This would push more people towards car usage, which only exacerbates environmental issues, adds to congestion, and compromises the safety of non-drivers. Research consistently shows that increasing car lanes does not reduce congestion; it often has the opposite effect. Bike lanes, on the other hand, encourage environmentally friendly travel, alleviate traffic, and support local economies. Removing these lanes forces many, including myself, into cars for shorter journeys\u2014undermining the environmental and economic benefits of cycling and taking up more road space. I urge you to consider the detrimental effects that Bill 212 would have on citizens like me who depend on safe and accessible cycling routes.\n"

The reason there\u2019s a smaller percentage of cyclists compared to motor vehicles is because there\u2019s not enough safe and/or completed cycling infrastructure. If more investment went into improving cycling infrastructure, then more car drivers will be enticed to bike or use public transit instead\u2014thus helping to alleviate congestion.\nIf these lanes are removed, it\u2019s only going to worsen overall traffic; not improve it. The people that do cycle will now be discouraged from cycling and will take up even more space on the roads with their cars\u2014causing even more congestion . The best way to alleviate traffic gridlock is to invest in multiple modes of safe, reliable transportation (which includes cycling infrastructure). A car centric road network is not the way.\nI also do not support the provision for provincial approval of additional new bike lanes. This will only stall and delay necessary cycling projects or be a tool to outright reject them altogether without proper consideration.\n"

By focusing on motor vehicle transport (at the detriment at other viable means of transportation) means most people would want to commute by car, which does not scale as the population density increases.\nBy establishing CONVENIENT and reliable alternative forms of transportation such as public transport and CYCLING, you reduce the number of people who drive, and therefore reducing traffic as a whole.\nRemoving the sections of the Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue bike lanes will only push more people to drive and therefore increase traffic and congestion. Furthermore, requiring provincial approval for the installation of bike lanes is a massive overreach over municipalities, and will result in a massive slow down of new bike infrastructure.\nBike lanes are not an inconvenience, they are a safety requirement for cyclists and also help motorists as well as no one likes to have to share the road with each other (motorists find it slow, and cyclists find it dangerous).\nI believe this bill should not be passed, and instead focus should be put on increasing bike infrastructure within Toronto and other cities in Ontario, as the only way to reduce car traffic isn't to build another highway, but to make other forms of transportation more convenient. For cities, cars are not the future, and they could never be.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly believe that the province should neither remove existing bike infrastructure nor require provincial approval for new bike lanes, for several reasons:\n1. Safe bike infrastructure that covers large parts of the city will reduce the number of cars on the road over time. The ability to bike safely will provide an incentive to switch from driving to biking, which will either reduce or have no effect on car traffic, even if the number of traffic lanes is reduced, since bikes take up a lot less space than cars. This is supported by several studies in many cities (see supporting link #1).\n2. Bike lanes do not have a negative impact on businesses, even if traffic lanes are reduced (see supporting link #2). They are also beneficial for the economy, because:\n    a. Their cost as a means of moving commuters is minuscule compared to the cost of building infrastructure for cars.\n    b. Since bike lanes reduce the number of cars on the road (see point #1), they also lessen the wear and tear on roads, thus reducing maintenance costs.\n3. Bike lanes increase transportation freedom, by providing safe alternatives to driving. Not everyone is able to drive or own a car, for several reasons: they might be underage, they might not be able to afford the costs associated with owning/renting a car, etc. These individuals should have access to a safe alternative to driving.\n4. Requiring provincial approval to build bike infrastructure will increase bureaucracy and slow down the development of important projects aimed at enhancing transportation options.\n5. Protected bike lanes make driving simpler and safer for car drivers, because cyclists do not interfere with traffic.\n6. If there are concerns that bike lanes occupy important traffic space, eliminating on-street parking should be considered first, since it takes up a lot more traffic lanes in many major streets in Toronto.\n"
