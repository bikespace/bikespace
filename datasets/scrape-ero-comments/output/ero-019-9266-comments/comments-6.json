Instead of actually enacting changes that get homes built cheaper, we focus on irrelevant things such as bike lanes. We want more people using these lanes and public transit to relieve congestion. Provide more security and investment in public transit and don\u2019t waste the people\u2019s time\n"

        "comment": "I strongly disagree with this regressive proposal. It fails to account for basics concepts around environmental sustainability, induced demand, and human safety.\nHighway 413 will be an astoundingly expensive use of taxpayer money, it will be a very resource-intensive project, and it will fail to meaningfully address gridlock and traffic, because in the long term, induced demand (an inevitability) will mean that traffic and gridlock will inevitably become problems on the newly built highway, in addition to remaining problems on existing roadways. Will the province then spend yet more money to build yet another highway, only for the same problems to occur?\nThe building of new roadways (rather than the maintenance of existing ones) is environmentally impactful. The proposal says that environmental impact will be \"considered\", but this does not mean the environment will be prioritized. Something can easily be \"considered\", and those considerations then discarded. I have no confidence that due consideration will result in mitigation of environmental destruction.\nFurther, every person who is riding a bike is a person who is not inside a car. Bicycles are a low-to-no-impact mode of transportation environmentally-speaking, and the fewer people who use private cars unnecessarily the better for our environment. It is unclear to me why the province would want to discourage free choice in this matter.\nBicycle lanes enable people riding bikes to do so safely, with less risk of being in a collision or crash (being hit by a person driving a car). Data do not support the idea that bike lanes negatively impact travel times for people who choose to drive. Data also do not support the idea that they negatively impact travel times for emergency services vehicles (rather, it's cars which are in the way of emergency vehicles, and it's harder for a car to get out of the way on any road than it is for a bicycle). Fewer cars on the roads means easier transit for emergency vehicles.\nFinally, municipalities should be allowed to make decisions that effect their residents, including installing and maintaining bicycle lanes used by local residents and visitors. It is inappropriate for people who do not live in a city to be able to unilaterally prevent municipalities from making such decisions, and to force cities to remove existing infrastructure at taxpayer expense. This is government overreach.\nFree choice in mode of travel, including allowing people who choose to get around by bike to do so safely, is the way of the future. Forcing a top-down heavy-handed approach on cities, at taxpayer expense, is regressive policymaking.\n"

        "comment": "The idea that restricting or removing bike lanes will improve traffic congestion is not borne out by evidence. On the contrary, it has been demonstrated repeatedly, in our own community and many others, that giving people viable options other than cars to move around (bike, transit, walking) is an effective way to reduce traffic congestion. There is no evidence that suggests removing bike lanes will reduce travel time for drivers.\nFurther, I find it very troubling that our government would focus on improving travel times for drivers at the expense of travel times for cyclists. Cyclists need to travel to all the same destinations that drivers do and they deserve to be able to travel there as directly and safely as drivers can.\nFinally, this seems like an extreme overreach on the province's part. It seems plainly evident that a municipality is in the best position to decide how to design roads that suit its community's needs. It appears incredibly wasteful to create a bureaucracy just so municipalities can seek approval for the roads they want to build.\nRespectfully, I urge you not to adopt this poorly thought out proposal.\n"

We like knowing to get in that left lane at that intersection, or that right lane when heading towards an off-ramp. I get driving can be relaxing.\nIt is even more relaxing when bike riders are over there, safe in their own lane, and I don't have to worry about them. They're not at risk, and I don't have to be as vigilant. Bike lanes are a great addition to our city. Keep them. Put up those little cement barriers. Thousands of people bike to work, to the gym, and to pick up their kids.\nAnd why, when this bloated government in this province has a \"Minister of Red Tape\" would you increase the paperwork, the delay?\nGet the transit lines running. The GO train experience is actually speedy and pleasant, and you don't have to pay for parking. Expand that and make it easier for commuters to get to work in the city.\n"

I am not a cyclist, but it's because I've been hesitant to put my life at risk on the roads in this city. Having our council go through more hoops to allow this city to respond to research saying bike lanes WORK is not the way forward. The Province should take a leaf out of the City's book in basing policy and bills on actual research and not just feelings and personal preferences.\n"

They also don't have good substitutes, especially University and Yonge. For the most part these lanes have come out of street parking and not lanes of traffic. It would be madness to go back to how we were before. It will make biking more dangerous and encourage people to drive more because of a lack of options.\n"

Downtown Toronto does not have room for all the cars people are bringing in. It does however have room for all the people, if they chose a different mode of transportation. We need bike lanes, streetcar lanes, subways, and overall better transit to reduce gridlock and shorten travel times. Torontonians have been adopting cycling only because we have been given the infrastructure to do so safely. New residents will keep choosing cars if the construction of these lanes is slowed.\n"

Cars and trucks are getting bigger. If the province wants to reduce gridlock they should implement more puclic transit options. More cars and more roads is not the direction of progress.
