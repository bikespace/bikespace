I remember when the government rolled out the gas tax reduction in 2022, something I often heard then was we needed to reduce the price of gas because people 'had no choice but to drive'. I fail to see how removing alternatives to driving helps with this.\nCycling:\n-Provides physical exercise (saving money for our health care industry)\n-Is cheaper\n-Is safer\n-Makes less noise and takes up less space (more pleasent for the local community)\n-Infrastructure also provides access for people with disabilities, old and young people who cant drive\nBut you need to provide a safe network of transit to get people to use it - because cars are so dangerous. Why are we helping the most dangerous form of transit?\n"

        "comment": "Hi - just wanted to express concern for this bill. I'm a motorist, I sometimes cycle, I take transit and I sometimes walk. I believe the best path forward for our province is to provide road users with options. Ripping cycling infrastructure out of the ground to add back one car lane is not going to have any form of meaningful impact on motorist commute times. Removing hundreds or thousands of cars from the roads by providing commuters with alternative transportation options will. Our province is growing at an incredible pace - traffic is only going to get worse. The only long-term solution to congestion is to invest heavily in public transit and cycling infrastructure. There is not enough physical space in our cities to add more roads for more cars. This is common sense.\nLastly - there's the fiscal part of this. I'm shocked that a \"fiscally conservative\" government would recommend removing existing cycling infrastructure at the tax payer's expense, when the majority of that infrastructure (especially in Toronto) is quite literally brand new. This a shocking waste of money and resources and frankly disrespectful to the residents of municipalities who have already paid for it, already lived through the construction and now need to pay to remove and repave all those roads all over again. Really awful, inappropriate and wasteful thinking here.\n"

Bike lanes have significant cost-saving, environmental, and public health benefits that would be destroyed along with their removal. We need the opportunity to create more bike infrastructure and connectivity to incentivize people to feel safe to use their bikes. The fact that some bike lanes aren't used yet is not because people don't want to, it's because they're poorly connected to other bike lines, such that people have to risk their lives to bike in car lanes.\n"

        "comment": "https://ero.ontario.ca/notice/019-9266\nThis Bill is counter productive and ignores all the data and research showing the path to reduce congestion. It also would allow skipping steps on building Highway 413 where a project like this is exactly why we have these steps.\nI live in a city in a rural area with limited bike infrastructure. My main form of transportation is by bike and there is limited bike infrastructure in my area, but we are planning more. Studies have shown us there is a lot of latent demand to bike and we know car transportation is highly inefficient, both in terms of money and land/capacity, when only moving 1-2 people per vehicle. Even when I do drive, I wish bikes were out of my way on their own infrastructure. As long as it\u2019s still possible to get to a destination by driving, getting more people out of cars will improve travel times.\nThe Minister of Transportation stated that only 1.2% of people commute by bike in Toronto. However, this information is old data from the 2011 Census, covers the whole Toronto CMA, and only represents the primary method of commuting so someone biking to public transit would be represented as a public transit commuter. The vast majority of the Toronto CMA has poor or non-existent bike infrastructure so it\u2019s unsurprising they have limited bike usage. However, in areas of Toronto with good bike infrastructure, biking represents 15% to 20% of commuters. This correlation demonstrates that building good bike infrastructure will encourage people to use it, which in turn will reduce congestion and save the city and the province money.\nThe Minister also stated that bike lanes are taking away nearly half of the infrastructure on those roads. However, this is factually incorrect as even a road with a bike lane and car lane in each direction is at most ~33% bike lanes. Most of the streets he is talking about have parking lanes which reduces this percentage even further.\nThis bill also proposes exempting Highway 413 from needing an Environmental Assessment. This type of major infrastructure project is exactly why we require Environmental Assessments, so that we are aware of the negative impacts of a project before we blindly incur these repercussions. The government states skipping this step is necessary because this project is so essential. Besides the fact that I don\u2019t agree Highway 413 is essential, this hasn\u2019t been used on any other projects that are essential like those for TTC or GO.\nThank you for your time.\n"

I personally use the Bloor and University bike lanes daily, and see them busy year round. I am concerned that the statistics being used to claim low usage of the bike lanes are out of date and misrepresentative of current usage (as they are from during the height of the pandemic when people were less likely to leave their homes).\nWithout bike lanes, I expect that people will continue to bike but will be forced to do so on roads with cars. Not only is this a major safety concern that puts me and countless other Torontonians at daily risk of injury and death while commuting, but it also defeats the purpose of removing the bike lanes. Cars will now just be stuck behind cyclists that they have been forced to share the road with. When I drive I prefer not having to worry about cyclists on the road with me. Separated bike lanes are better for everyone.\nPlease reconsider.\n"

It has been repeatedly demonstrated by research and empirical evidence to the point where at this point it ought to be a truism.\nBesides that, we are currently a province which has demonstrated itself reluctant to actually maintain infrastructure and health care.

        "comment": "Subject: Strong Opposition to the Removal of Cycling Infrastructure and Prevention of Future Lanes on Major Roads\nTo Whom It May Concern,\nI am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed bill that seeks to dismantle existing bike lanes and prevent the creation of new ones on major roads in Ontario. This proposal threatens the significant progress made in urban transportation over the past decade and undermines public safety, economic efficiency, and environmental goals.\n**Impact on Safety and Accessibility:** The cycling lanes on Bloor, University, and Yonge Streets are among the busiest and most utilized in Toronto. These lanes provide a safe, separated space for thousands of cyclists daily, promoting safer streets for all road users. Removing these lanes would significantly increase the risk for cyclists, and without nearby alternatives, the safety benefits achieved through years of careful planning and investment would be lost overnight.\n**Return on Investment:** The city and provincial governments have invested millions in upgrading cycling infrastructure to internationally recognized standards. The recent AAA (All Ages and Abilities) upgrades were designed to bring intersections and lane separations up to Dutch-style standards, promoting the safe coexistence of all road users. Dismantling these bike lanes would squander this investment and the public funds already spent to enhance them.\n**Economic and Environmental Benefits:** A robust cycling infrastructure supports economic vitality by increasing foot traffic to local businesses. Eliminating these bike lanes would likely discourage cycling, leading to greater reliance on motor vehicles, increased emissions, and worsened traffic congestion. This move contradicts Ontario\u2019s sustainability goals and the global imperative to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n**Global Leadership and Local Needs:** Ontario has an opportunity to lead in sustainable, accessible urban planning by modelling the benefits of a balanced, multimodal transportation network. Removing high-utilization bike lanes that meet international standards not only undermines this leadership but also ignores the needs and preferences of a significant portion of Toronto's population.\n**Consultation and Community Input:** The lack of meaningful consultation with the communities who use, benefit from, and rely on these bike lanes is concerning. I urge the government to engage with community stakeholders, including residents, cycling advocates, local businesses, and environmental groups, to explore solutions that enhance safety and mobility without sacrificing hard-won gains in sustainable infrastructure.\nFor the reasons stated above, I respectfully request that the government reconsider this legislation and retain the existing bike lanes on major roads. These bike lanes are critical to ensuring a safe, healthy, and prosperous future for Ontario.\nThank you for considering my input on this critical issue.\nSincerely,\nConcerned Ontarian\n"

        "comment": "I am deeply frustrated by this bill. As someone who relies on bike lanes daily, I view them as essential infrastructure for safety and mobility. Removing these lanes only increases vulnerability for cyclists like myself. Prioritizing driver convenience over the safety of cyclists and pedestrians disregards the needs of many Ontarians, including those who are already deeply marginalized.\nSafety should come before maximizing road space for cars. Reducing congestion can be achieved by providing accessible alternatives, such as consistent regional transit. For instance, I live in Guelph, and while many of us would prefer to take the train, the lack of weekend service often forces us to drive. Expanding transit options and increasing the frequency of regional trains would ease congestion and improve the quality of life.\nResearch shows that bike lanes don\u2019t cause congestion. They often help reduce it by offering alternative transportation options. Making streets less safe for cyclists will ultimately worsen congestion as more people are discouraged from using active transportation and thus incentivized to drive.\nAdding red tape not only restricts progress but actively interferes with municipalities implementing the vital infrastructure their constituents need. Municipalities are not building bike lanes without careful consideration\u2014these projects go through review processes to ensure they meet community needs and safety standards. The province should be supporting, not obstructing, these efforts to create safer, more inclusive transportation networks.\n"

        "comment": "I am against this proposal for two main reasons:\n1. Removing / blocking bike lanes to increase road capacity for cars is contrary to data and research that this will not improve traffic and will increase it in the long term. From an environmental perspective, reducing safe cycling infrastructure will discourage environmentally friendly biking and encourage more cars on the road, adding to pollution.\n2. Provincial government overreach to go against the community\u2019s and elected municipal officials\u2019 decisions and cause additional waste of tax payer money.\nThe increasing population and removal of safe alternatives to driving will increase the number of vehicles with limited additional space to accommodate them in urban centres. You cannot keep increasing road capacity in a city centre.\nRemoving / blocking bike lanes will force more people into cars and make it more dangerous for those who continue to bike.\nThere are better areas to focus on to address the increases in traffic.\nWhen ride share for short/medium trips is not much more expensive than transit and significantly faster / more convenient - this encourages way more cars on the roads increasing gridlock. When construction and on-street parking take up lanes and transit projects are delayed for years - this causes significantly more traffic issues. When highways are parking lots at rush hour, backing up city streets to on ramps, but still faster and more convenient than regional / local transit options for many people, this will increase traffic.\nThe province can help by investing in better public transit (and timely completion of major transit projects), which is proven to alleviate traffic.\nAfter a number of cyclist deaths recently, this proposal is dangerous, regressive and unnecessary red tape. It is undemocratic overreach - these types of municipal matters should be decided by the community and their elected council. The hastily added proposal to take out existing bike lanes is a waste of taxpayer money and no data or studies have been provided to justify the whims of the premier.\nFinally, the fact that the proposed legislation includes bypassing the Environmental Assessment Act is obviously going to have negative impacts to the environment.\n\u201cNumerous studies have examined the effectiveness of [adding additional roadway] and consistently show that adding capacity to roadways fails to alleviate congestion for long because it actually increases vehicle miles traveled (VMT).\u201d\n(Quoted from link below)\n"

        "comment": "I am a frequent driver on Toronto and Ontario roads, and occasional cyclist and I strongly oppose the proposed legislation, especially as it pertains to limiting, reducing, or even removing cycling infrastructure in Ontario. I oppose these actions for the following reasons:\n1. There should be more options when getting around cities or elsewhere, not fewer. All of these options need to be as safe as possible.\n2. As a driver, I would rather cyclists be separated from car traffic. The only times I have felt uncomfortable around a cyclist is when they were forced to ride with car traffic due to lack of infrastructure. People will still bike on main roads out of necessity or preference, but removing bike infrastructure will only make them more likely to lose life or limb, and make drivers more stressed in trying to look out for them.\n3. I absolutely oppose the reversal or removal of any existing bike infrastructure and any additional red tape placed on municipalities by the Province. Whatever taxpayer money that would be spent on these activities, I want to be spent on improving transit options, enabling safe bike storage, incentivizing people to bike more and drive less, etc.\n4. We should be making exercise in any form more accessible and safe, as this brings down healthcare costs, with the effects compounding over years and decades. Promoting exercise through safe, accessible cycling and other activities sets up Ontario for success over the long term and ultimately gives children more time with their parents.\nI am speaking for myself and others in my life who do not have the time to comment in this manner. Please cancel these proposed changes and give Ontarians the options they deserve.\n"

        "comment": "The Act is a huge step towards the past. It will undermine our future. Removing bike lanes is clearly an attempt to push for more urban sprawl. By removing bike options we encourage car use. We therefore encourage more space for cars - to park them at work, home, and in other spaces. To use more space, we need to convert natural spaces essential for life, human life included. We need this to reduce the impacts of climate change and ensure we have enough food for our future.\nAt a time where the cost of living is so high, do we really want to increase food costs? To add on costs of having to own cars? To add on the costs of having to expand through urban sprawl, and associated taxes with the upkeep of those spaces?\nThe potential benefits of these cars and urban sprawl do not outweigh the cons.\nOntario contains the most densely populated areas in the country and is home to 40% of Canada\u2019s population. We urgently need the government of Ontario to demonstrate leadership that provides its residents with more \u2013 not fewer \u2013 opportunities for achieving a sustainable, safe, and prosperous future.\nBuilding for the Future\nWe worry that the legislation will jeopardize most future developments of safe, protected bike lanes in Ontario, reducing transportation options for children and families and contributing to higher rates of collisions, physical inactivity, and pollution.\nWe strongly encourage reversing course on this legislation and instead encourage municipalities to continue building networks of high-quality protected bike lanes on major streets.

        "comment": "The decision to remove bike lanes in Toronto goes directly against the stated goal of reducing congestion. Many of the cities across the globe that have the lowest rates of vehicle congestion also have the largest bike lane networks. This is not a coincidence, and the move to methods of active transportation such as biking, is the only viable solution to congestion both in the short- and long-term. Not only does this proposal spend taxpayer money on the bulldozing of existing infrastructure, but does it for a reason not supported by said bulldozing. While the Minister of Transportation has vocalized that only 1.2% of trips in Toronto are completed by bicycle, this statistic is over a decade old. Statistics Canada has not collected this data since, though other sources suggest that number has skyrocketed. From a City of Toronto study on bike lane use, Adelaide and Richmond corridors saw a 1095% increase in bike traffic after the installation of bike lanes, a number so staggering that it alone should exemplify the need for these lanes.\nAs well, to offer a rebuttal to the Government's position that bike lanes belong on side streets, the question remains how this would effectively offer a viable route for those taking it. Toronto's street layout rarely offers a single, comparable, side street to the main avenues, and so cyclists would be forced to take a meandering and often noticeably longer route. Not only does this fly in the face of the point of bike lanes, but also reduces their use.\nIf this government is serious about reducing congestion, adding lanes of traffic is not, and will not be the solution. Induced demand created by adding vehicle lanes will create a never-ending loop of the widening of roads, something that is unsustainable by any view. Creating viable alternative options to vehicular transport is the only way, both short- and long-term, to reduce congestion. Bettering public transport, changing zoning laws, and adding to the bike network are the solutions agreed upon by the vast majority of experts, yet this proposal ignores every shred of evidence on this topic.\nWith all this considered, I cannot fathom a reasonable explanation for this Government's desire to spend money on removing existing infrastructure in the name of a goal that physically cannot be accomplished by the proposal at hand. I urge all officials involved in this proposal to scrap it entirely, if not even to rethink or restate its goal. If the Government wants to remove bike lanes because they simply don't like them, that is one thing, but to remove them with a goal that makes no logical sense in comparison is to treat the people of Ontario like children. We deserve better than this treatment, and I urge this proposal to not be enacted as laid out.\n"
