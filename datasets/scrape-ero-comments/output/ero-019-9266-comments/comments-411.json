An important consideration when our health care system is struggling and too many people suffer from preventable diseases like diabetes- preventable by regular exercise.  As a country we do a lot of talking about the environment, but this kind of legislation does not support the talk. Furthermore municipalities should be left alone to make decisions for their neighborhoods by the people in those neighborhoods and the officials they elected.\n"

        "comment": "This bill tries to make riding bikes within cities into a culture war to distract from some of the very shady acts buried within. The OCP is well aware that their acts set out in schedules 1, 2, 3, and 5 would be wildly unpopular with the majority of Ontarians so they appear to have hidden it behind this attack on bikes and urban mobility.\nI am strongly opposed to all of the acts mentioned above.\nHere are my comments surrounding the act from schedule 4:\nThis act conveniently ignores the fact that there isn't enough space in the city of Toronto for everyone to drive their own car everywhere they want to go. You could remove bike lanes and sidewalks, pave over parks and front lawns to add more lanes and we would still have crippling traffic and gridlock. This is not a political argument, it's a physics one. We have traffic and gridlock because cars and car parking take up too much of the limited space within a highly populated city.\nThe only proven way to reduce traffic is to provide viable alternatives to driving. When you give people other ways of of getting from point A to point B, you take cars off the road and reduce traffic for those who need to drive. Cars should not be the only way to around the city and should instead be one of several transportation options that includes public transit, bikes, and walking. When I'm driving, I love to see cyclists because it means one less car in my lane. And it's great to have them in their own lane so I don't get stuck behind them and I don't need to be as worried about anyone getting hurt.\nThe statements from the Premier about bike lane usage is extremely deceitful. Much of the city does not have bike lanes so people living in or travelling to those areas do not have the option to bike. Bike usage in the city will continue to grow as more and more parts of the city become accessible with safe bike lanes. And each time someone chooses to bike instead of drive, it will remove a car from the road. I used to drive or Uber every time I visited friends in the Kensington area because biking down Bathurst was so unsafe. Now that College St has bike lanes, I take my bike instead. It's a circular logic - there are not bike lanes so nobody bikes - then the Premier says 'nobody bikes so we don't need bike lanes'. Imagine if we applied that same logic to car lanes: if we close every cross-street that connects to Bloor we'd have zero cars on Bloor. Then we could conclude that nobody drives on Bloor and we could remove the car lanes!\nIf you get rid of bike lanes (especially the main arteries of Yonge, Bloor, and University) most people are going to switch back to driving leading to more cars on the road and the same old traffic and gridlock. Some people will continue biking but will be forced to share the road which will further slow down traffic and lead to more conflicts between drivers/riders and many more injuries/deaths.\nThe OCP should focus on their provincial duties instead of pretending to be the mayor of Toronto. Stay in your lane.\n"

These should only be reviewed from the City authorities with no overseeing government that can decline safety for all users.\nPrioritizing cars will is a step backwards and we should focus on safety for all users of the road which includes cars, bikes, and people on foot.\nGoing fast is when accidents happen and people get killed.\nThe government spent money on the bike infrastructure on Yonge, Bloor, and University for a reason. Going backwards and undoing this work is costing tax payers more money and not saving money.\nBikes and slower transportation such as walking allows people to stop and go into stores to shop supporting local businesses. By removing this mode people driving will not stop for local businesses and will only go to the destination across town.\nPlease consult with all businesses along these streets and anywhere in Ontario where bike infrastructure is being considered to understand how bike lanes will impact these businesses and to gain more knowledge before removing bike lanes.\nThere are items in the proposal \"develops the criteria for evaluating\" this should be included now before implementing any Bill. Without a plan will only mean devastation with no criteria.\nI am very disappointed by this proposed Bill and do not support any of it.\n"

        "comment": "The throughput of a bike lane far exceeds a car lane and requires far less space. Removing bike lanes will only increase traffic and waste everyone's time as the people that choose to drive instead of bike take up far more space on the road than the bike lane did.\nThe only solution to traffic is viable alternatives to driving. Toronto traffic was horrible before bike lanes, and there's no reason to believe that it'll be any better after removing them. Owning and commuting by car is a massive expense, and people deserve the option to not have to do it.\nMany will still choose to bike even with the removal of infrastructure. Would drivers prefer bikers dangerously share the lanes with them instead of having their own space? Would that save anyone's time? Certainly not, but it would result in more cyclists dying after collisions with cars. Is this what drivers want?\nOf course, the government is well-aware of all this. This bill is yet another attempt at pandering to Ford's suburban conservative base who are not at all affected by bike lanes in Toronto.\n"

        "comment": "As a resident of York reigon who cannot drive for medical reasons and is especially prone to potential injury in case of an accident for those same reasons, this bill represents a direct threat to my well-being.\nhaving safe, separated bike infrastructure is crucial for suburban towns like mine that NEED to move away from cars being the main mode of personal transportation. there are countless individuals like myself who rely on micromobility (bikes, e-bikes, e-scooters, ect.) for a host of reasons, and that number is only going to increase in the coming decades as people are increasingly unable to afford car ownership, or may be rendered unable to drive due to Long Covid.\nEven if one were to ignore the personal needs of micromobility users, bike infrastructure is also a vital cost-savings measure for towns and cities. road maintenance is a significant expense to suburban towns, costing york reigon around 51.5 million in 2021, and the cost has only risen since. getting as many people out of cars and onto micromobility (which causes an order of magnitude less wear on roads) should be a priority for this reason alone.\nOntario simply cannot afford to limit or impede the devlopment of bike infrastructure, financially or morally.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is backwards thinking being proposed by people who have clearly ignored the current data on how urban traffic congestion is reduced. Cyclists have a right to safe travel. Their tax dollars pay for infrastructure too, and that includes bike lanes. Congestion from cars is due to an underfunded, under developed transit system, not bike lanes.  Decisions to drastically change Toronto's infrastructure should not be being made by  \"Torontonians\" who don't even live in Toronto proper, let alone the down town core.  NO to this bill. Yes to more bike lanes.  Bring back transit city.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 will negatively affect me and my community, and should be abandoned. I am a regular user of the Yonge Street bike lanes, using them several times a week to travel from my home near Yonge & St. Clair to work in downtown Toronto. Removing the bike lanes would force me to ride my bicycle in mixed traffic with automobiles, reducing my safety by putting me at greater risk of collisions with automobiles. I recently moved to and selected my current building of residence because it was accessible to safe cycling infrastructure, and feel it is unfair for the province to change my local community in such an arbitrary and negative way.\nRemoving bike lanes is both unsafe and counterproductive. I don\u2019t think removing bike lanes will achieve the stated objective of reducing traffic congestion. Bicycles will continue to ride on Yonge Street, but in general traffic lanes rather than their own bike lane, interacting more closely with cars. There will be more collisions, and I am concerned there will be serious injuries and deaths. Mixing bike and car traffic will still require cars to travel at a safe speed for cyclists and keep a safe distance back. There are no reasonable alternative routes to Yonge Street that have bike lanes, and no secondary or local streets that connect to provide an alternate route because of grid discontinuities and barriers like the CP rail corridor. Avenue Road and Mount Pleasant Road are the most reasonable alternatives, but are worse options because they are higher speed arterials with more traffic generally unsafe for bikes. In fact, it would seem that encouraging more cycling by providing safe infrastructure for it would be a better way to reduce emissions and congestion, which is caused by too many automobile drivers.\nI am also concerned about equity impacts, that the bill will have disproportionate negative effects on poor people and visible minority communities. Cycling is affordable, and used more by disadvantaged individuals to work and accomplish daily tasks. Removing bike lanes will have negative impacts on bike couriers and delivery workers, many of whom are members of poor and minority communities. The equity impacts of removing bike lanes have not been studied, and should be studied carefully before the proposals are implemented.\n"

There was no research done to assess the impact they would have when they went in and there is no follow up on how things are going. Bike lanes have a place. Some of the roads they are placed on just creates more traffic/congestion and dangerous situations, busier residential streets as car traffic is diverted there, small businesses losing customers as there is no where to park. The majority of people still drive and putting in bike lanes will not get them to make the switch to cycling.\n"

Getting my G1 was prompted by my anticipation of starting a family soon.  However, I do not wish to drive when possible so to stay physically active, and hope to bike with my future children safely, too.\nThe proposed bill is anti-choice and anti-safety.  There is no reason I should be put at risk for wishing to commute using my own two legs, whether it be against the pavement or a bike pedal, over a using a motor vehicle.  I already bike from work on some occasions (and did so too when living along Danforth in Toronto), and would do it more were the infrastructure improved.  The removal of this infrastructure would be devastating and negatively impact my health.  I have a desk job and biking is one of the few physical activities I can reliably perform that fits in my busy work schedule.\nThis bill adds unnecessary red tape for municipalities about local, resident-driven transportation decisions for which the provincial government ought not to concern itself with.  I think it is unjust for the provincial government to impose transportation restrictions against citizens of a municipality and what they want for their place of residence.  If bike lane reductions need to happen, it should be decided by the local people that actually use the infrastructure.  If bike lanes need to be added, the process should not be further slowed down through legislature; I firmly believe such processes are already too slow in Ontario.\nBikes move more people per square meter than cars, trucks, and SUVs by simple virtue of being significantly less bulky.  I do not believe we need to expand the number of car lanes to get better throughput capacity.  Rather, we need more and better infrastructure for all the alternative methods of transportation which have greater throughput efficiency and move more with less space.  However, this bill is currently leading us the complete opposite direction with its cars-first-and-only approach.\nI do not wish to lose my future children in an preventable accident due to a lack of safe biking infrastructure.  I do not wish to get killed for wanting to live an active lifestyle.  This bill deeply threatens the safety of many.  Not just for today, but for years to come.\n"

For many people in Ontario, bike lanes are a necessary piece of transportation infrastructure, just the same as roads and sidewalks.\nSpecifically, the proposed legislation to remove the bike lanes along Bloor, Yonge, and University is an enormous waste of public funds, and threatens a vital piece of multi-modal transportation in Toronto. These routes all run along subway lines, and together they form a vital transportation network that is greater than the sum of its parts. Personally, the removal of these bike lanes would force me to switch from primarily commuting by bike, to primarily commuting using my car \u2013 further contributing to the problem of congestion.\nThis proposal by Doug Ford is ideologically motivated, and is designed to accommodate a single mode of vehicular transportation. It caters to a single demographic, and completely disregards the diverse needs of the people of Ontario.\nBike lanes are vital component of the SOLUTION to congestion, not the cause of it. Ironically, this bill will ultimately cause what it sets out to prevent, by forcing more people to drive where they otherwise would not have.\nThere is no solution to congestion without viable alternatives to driving.\n"

Also, the cities should be able to decide for themselves whether to build a bike lane, as they are the ones getting impacted and also knowing why. This proposal could lead to cycling paths that lead nowhere or have giant holes, because the province thought that part of the path wouldn't be worth removing a car lane, which would lead to way fewer people cycling.I hope you reconsider this, have a great rest of the day:).
