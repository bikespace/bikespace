Transit is unreliable but I can depend on my bike. If I don't ride, I will have to drive my car (which is collecting dust) and I know I'm not the only one.\nAll the bike lanes we have were installed after extensive public consultation and study. Having some minister who doesn't even live here decide based on his feelings if a bike lane is justified or not, is dictating.\nPeople will die if you do this. In my neighbourhood I see mums & dads taking their kids to school on the back of bikes. There are roads here where bikes out number cars during rush hours. Let people make the healthier, cheaper, and environmentally friendly choice safely.\nIf you want traffic to move, install smart traffic lights. Help transit to function reliably.\n"

        "comment": "If Premier Ford removes the bike lanes on Yonge, Bloor and University that the city of Toronto has continuously improved and made more permanent after careful consideration, I think this would be a colossal waste of our taxpayer money and be a massive step backwards in sustainable transportation. The separated bike lanes increase the safety of cyclists, allowing many of my friends who were too scared to bike on normal roads without bike lanes bike around Toronto for the first time. For drivers it also allows them to be separated from cyclists too so that they do not need to be worried about hitting someone on a bike as likely.\nGridlock will only get worse by getting rid of bike lanes, all these cyclists will then have to drive cars increasing the number of cars on the road. More parking spots will need to be devoted to this increase in cars in the downtown core.\nI ride on the Bloor bike lane everyday and I am outraged that the Premier wants to remove them as a political stunt to his suburbanite base that does not even live in Toronto.\nThe Toronto city council has clearly voted 21-4 in favour of urging Ford to leave our bike lanes alone, and let the city council govern its own city as it should.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes in Toronto is a HUGE mistake. Relevant research demonstrates that removing bike lanes does NOT decrease car traffic and in fact increases the number of cars on the road, worsening the problem. Toronto needs more bike lanes and better public transportation to deal with its traffic issues. Ignoring the research on this matter is dangerous.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to strongly oppose Bill 212. Bike lanes should be a municipal decision, built according to the needs and desires of the municipality in which bike lanes serve as important transportation infrastructure. This should not (nor has it been in the past) be a Provicially-led decision.\nThe basis of this proposal - that the removal of bike lanes will alleviate traffic - has no scientific, practical, or financial basis. I would urge you to cite research or proof that the removal of these bike lanes would improve traffic congestion, rather than providing anecdotal insights and the Premier's personal viewpoints on cyclists.\nBike lanes are life-saving infrastructure that allow for a city's inhabitants to more easily opt out of driving. Studies of bike lanes in Toronto show that bike lanes increased cyclist volume by over 2.5x, which translates to a real reduction in the number of cars on the road. The use of Bike Share in Toronto has increased many times over - amounting to almost 6 million rides taken in 2023 alone.The roads are meant to be used by everyone and all vulnerable users of it have equal rights to belong. The city's infrastructure should be a reflection of all users, and not strongly cater to one particular kind. All residents (pedestrians, cyclist, food delivery riders, cars, transit users) pay taxes and have equal rights to feel safe while using the city's roads.\nBike lanes are future-oriented infrastructure - not only for the fundamental fact that they prevent fatalities, but for the economic and environmental wellbeing of cities. Bike lanes are proven to reduce cyclist fatalities and reduce emissions (based on actual research). There is no supporting evidence that the addition of car lanes reduces traffic.\nShould the provincial government remove bike lanes, many cyclists will be forced to use car lanes to navigate the city, which will increase confusion and create gridlock and frustration among car users. Removing bike lanes will not remove cyclists. They will simply remove SAFE cycling, forcing bikes onto the road with motor vehicles.\nI would also note that the Province's first point in the Environment Plan is to encourage cycling or transit as a transportation option. This Bill would directly contradict this important plan\nThe provincial government should not spend taxpayer money on undoing municipal infrastructure projects and should instead focus on fixing the Gardiner, finishing the Eglinton LRT, and developing non-car-related methods for alleviating traffic in the city.\n"

        "comment": "I refer to a proposed addendum to Bill 212 - Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024:  \"Framework for bike lanes that require removal of a traffic lane.\"\nThis proposal is ill-considered, environmentally irresponsible, ignorant of health and human safety concerns, invasive on muncipal affairs, and spiteful.  It is foolish, atavisitic, expensive, and incredibly irresponsible. It is anathema to sound government policy. Do I make myself clear?\nI am a pedestrian, cyclist, transit user, and automobile driver. As a citizen in mid-town Toronto, I use all of these modes of transportation to move around the city. So far as I can tell, the Premier (whose personal mark is all over this legislation) is only one of these: he is well-known to be a driver of an enormous SUV.  The specific streets mentioned are bizarrely specific:  Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue. Is it a coincidence that the Premier's route from his home to his office plausibly includes these routes?\nI also travel extensively for my work. This has enabled me to visit cities literally all over the world, on all six continents.  In those visits, I have observed how people move around these cities.  In the ones that work best (and in the countries that are economically prosperous and socially happy), serious attention has been given to bicycle infrastructure. This is not a coincidence.\nFor instance, in Copenhagen, Denmark, bicycles outnumber cars by a factor of five. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling_in_Copenhagen)  That's because \u2014 thanks to bicycling infrastructure and responsible public transit policy \u2014 it's possible for people to get around the city without having to own a car.  Modern cities all over the world are emulating this approach. The increasing size and density of cities demands it.\nThe automobile, on a per-mile basis, is by far the most expensive form of transportation per person, in terms of actual expense for owners and infrastructure costs for municipalities. This does not include the externalities associated with pollution and climate change.\nBy contrast, the bicycle is environmentally friendly, and promotes exercise and good health \u2014 which lowers health care costs. Bicycle infrastructure costs pennies on the dollar relative to that for automobile transportation. Bicycle lanes provide separation between bicycles and drivers of automobiles \u2014 including enormous SUVs that might otherwise complain about bicycles \"being in the way\".  This is important.  Without that separation, the lives of cyclists are at risk.  (https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/cyclist-killed-dufferin-mall-ale\u2026)\nThe proposed legislation would include \"an exemption from the Environmental Assessment Act\" \u2014 which is telling. Such an exemption wouldn't be necessary if the proposed legislation were consistent with the Act.\nThe proposed legislation would also \"the City of Toronto to provide support to facilitate the removal of the bike lanes.\" \"Support\", in this case, no doubt means \"money\".  There is a long history of Conservative governments in Ontario \"downloading\" costs to counties and municipalities.  As a resident (and taxpayer; the Premier cares about those) of Toronto, I object to the Premier and the provincial government meddling in this way. If municipalities are to take on costs, should they not be given the autonomy to make decisions about where and how to spend our tax dollars?\nIf the Province wants to remove bike lanes, the responsibility and the cost of doing so should fall entirely to the Province \u2014 but as a taxpayer in Ontario, I pay the excess cost of pulling up bike lanes either way. I thought the Premier cared about taxpayers!\nThe stated objective of the proposal is \"to fight gridlock and get drivers where they need to go faster.\"  First, drivers are not the only people who might wish to get where they need to go faster.  Why should the needs of drivers take precedence over other citizens? Second, if the goal to to reduce gridlock, the most powerful way to do that is to reduce the number of cars contending for space. Increase investment in public transit and bicycle infrastructure, such that people choose to leave their cars at home \u2014 or to not own a car at all.  Don't waste taxpayer dollars ripping up bike lanes.\n(\"Conservative\" governments have a long history of this sort of nonsense. In 1995, the Conservative Premier of the day filled in the tunnels that had already been bored for what will now be the Eglinton Crosstown line \u2014 only for those tunnels to be rebored at greater expense 20 years later.  It's a pity that line was never built; the current Premier would have had rapid transit practically from his front door to Queen's Park \u2014 but I digress.)\nReferring to the material at page https://ero.ontario.ca/notice/019-9266#proposal-details, we find this passage:  \"The Ontario government is proposing an addendum to the framework that would require the province to remove sections of the Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue bike lanes in the City of Toronto and return them to a lane of traffic for motor vehicles.\"\nBelow that, there is a passage headed \"The Government of Ontario\" which contains four points which are *completely irrelevant* to the addendum. Yonge, Bloor, and University are NOT highways, and do not intersect with Highway 413, which is not in the City of Toronto in any case. Experts can assure any interested parties that bicycle lanes in the city of Toronto will not drop the speed, quality, or reliability of broadband in rural or urban areas.\nIt is hard for me to maintain a moderate tone in these comments. Suffice it to say that this proposal is not conservative, and not sound; it is destructive and nihilstic. Stop it. Now.\n"

Remember the cyclists most likely also have or drive cars. They have just chosen to make the bicycle a solution to the grid lock for themselves. We should be encouraging that behaviour not catering to more cars which will only make the congestion worse. The province has no business taking over the ability of municipal governments to choose solutions that are supported by the people that elected them.\n"

        "comment": "I am not in favour of this proposal.\nFirst, adding red tape and beueaucracy for municipalities to wade through will not help Ontario communities to build much needed transportation infrastructure. Furthermore, I believe the provincial government is overstepping it's bounds by dictating decisions that should be left to local governments and city planners. There are a host of very important issues that I would prefer the provincial government dedicate their time to dealing with, and let municipalities decide what transportation infrastructure will best serve their communities.\nNext, like many Ontarians, I am a motorist, a cyclist, a transit rider and a pedestrian. As a cyclist who commutes to work daily by bicycle I consider safe, separated bicycle lanes to be critical transportation infrastructure, like sidewalks. Unfortunately, many Ontarians aren't as lucky as I am to have safe cycling infrastructure in place that works for their commutes. If this were the case, this proposal would be met with as much disapproval as a proposal to replace sidewalks with vehicle lanes. It would be unthinkable.\nAs a motorist, I can empathize with our Premier and his supporters. I too am annoyed when driving my car and being forced to mix with cyclists on roadways, and I often get anxious when driving on certain roads in my community where cyclists are forced to mix with motorized vehicles. This is simply unsafe, but the solution is not to try to stop people from using bicycles for transportation. The solution is to create and maintain safe infrastructure for ALL modes of transportation.\nAs a transit user, I'd like to point out that safe cycling infrastructure supports transit investment by making it easier for people to access stations. In cities with extensive cycling networks, it also saves costs for other infrastructure, simply because bicycle parking is immensely cheaper than automobile parking.\nLastly, as an Ontarian who does not reside in Toronto, I am dismayed to see my elected officials in provincial parliament creating laws that appear to be based on personal grudges limited to a single city hundreds of kilometers from my home. This proposed policy is clearly tone deaf to the needs of ALL Ontarians and as I've come to expect, is not only Toronto-centric but likely to be expensive and ineffective. I strongly urge you to abandon this proposal and focus on issues more squarely within provincial jurisdiction.\n"

Removing bike lanes wrong get rid of cyclists, it will just mix them in with other traffic\u2014unsafe for cyclists and stressful for drivers. Some may feel so unsafe they choose to drive instead, making congestion WORSE, not better. The consensus in the urban planning field is that this will make our streets LESS efficient and LESS safe for everyone.

There are a lot more Bikelanes in Demark and Holland, to name a few, which have been moving forward and achieved what you (Premier Ford) are claiming to achieve, but by going backwards. Do you really want to leave such a legacy?\nLeave bikelane building to the municipalities themselves.  Remind ourselves that every household owns some bikes in their garages, just need more safer places to ride more. People don't hate bikelanes, they hate congestion which is caused by too many cars, not too many bikelanes. Bikes were on the road first before cars being built.\n"

Are drivers complaining about bikes? They are likely jealous of us as we whizz by them stuck in traffic.

I don't ride on the sidewalks as some people do out of fear of traffic, much to the annoyance of pedestrians. There would be more cyclists and fewer cars on the roads if we had safe bike lanes. I lived in the Netherlands before retiring in 2014 and there I rode my bike to work every day along superb bicycle paths that were on every major street in every town and city. The Dutch drivers respected cyclists and likewise the cyclists rode in harmony with traffic because they had safe designated lanes for their exclusive use and traffic flowed easily.\nUpon our return to Canada I was appalled at the car culture and lack of infrastructure that promoted active transportation, healthy living and cleaner air. Not to mention the cost savings of riding a bike instead of driving.\nI am shocked that the Ford government wants millions of dollars spent on tearing out cycling lanes in Toronto and make it more difficult to include them in other municipalities. This is such retrograde, low level thinking and doesn't make any sense at all. Bike lanes don't cause traffic congestion. Cars do!\nIf Ontario is going to be a leader in the 21rst century it will have to include more bike lanes! I do not support Bill 212 in any iteration.

Here are some key points to consider:\nInduced Demand: Expanding road capacity often leads to more drivers using the road, a phenomenon known as induced demand, which can negate the initial improvements in traffic flow.\nSafety Concerns: Removing bike lanes forces cyclists to share lanes with cars, increasing the risk of accidents and potentially discouraging cycling.\nReduced Transportation Options: Eliminating bike lanes might push commuters who would have cycled back into cars, exacerbating traffic congestion.\nEnvironmental Impacts: Encouraging car use increases emissions and reduces the shift toward sustainable modes of transportation like cycling.\nCase Studies & Evidence\nCities that prioritize bike lanes often experience reduced overall traffic congestion because bikes take up less road space than cars, and their use can reduce the total number of vehicles on the road.\nResearch in cities like Copenhagen and Amsterdam shows that dedicated bike infrastructure encourages more people to cycle, thereby reducing car dependency and improving traffic flow.\nWhen bike lanes were removed in Toronto (Jarvis Street), it led to public backlash, as congestion worsened for all road users, and the decision was later reversed.\n"
