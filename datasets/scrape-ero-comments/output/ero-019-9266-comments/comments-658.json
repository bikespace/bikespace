        "comment": "As a registered planner with OPPI and a former resident of Toronto, bike lanes are important for safety.  I was nearly killed 2 times while riding my bicycle in Toronto on my daily activities because there were no bike lanes.  It is extremely dangerous to ride a bike in Toronto due to parked cars opening their doors and having to navigate street car tracks.  Bike lanes assure that at least part of the ride is safe and are encouraging for riders.\nIf you remove bike lanes, you are returning to a car-dominated planning strategy that frankly is outdated and regressive.  We should be striving to achieve a scenario similar to Scandanavia where bikes are predominant, encouraging healthy living.\nA better scenario than removing the bike lanes is to only have them operable in the summer months and shoulder seasons, and through signage allow cars or parking in the bike lanes in the winter.  This may require a reconsideration of lane widths ... look to Vancouver as an example of narrower traffic lanes.  You might also look at the bike lane construction in Calgary for inspiration.\nAnother scenario is to permit ebikes and escooters to use the bike lanes, which will relieve some of the traffic as commuters switch to these alternatives.  You might also look to Hong Kong for inspiration, a city that has dedicated lanes for public transit and a very low percentage of cars.  I lived and worked in this city, and was able to get to work in 45 minutes which included a 20 minute ferry, a quick walk, taking the trolley and then a 5-minute bus ride ... why was this possible?  Because there are very few cars on the road,  90% or more of the vehicles are public transit.  Hong Kong is a city of 7.5 million and a much denser urban population, but it is much better planned than Toronto and much less grid-lock.\nDoubling up on the Garden city skyway is not the right solution.  As a resident of St. Catharines, the only way that this will have any impact is if you increase the number of lanes on the QEW from Toronto to Niagara Falls.  A better solution for the tourist traffic to Niagara Falls is to build a new highway south of the Escarpment as shown in the Greater Golden Horseshoe Plan, this is the only solution that will work.  For those of us who live in Niagara, we do not want more lanes on the QEW.\nI am strongly opposed to these two aspects in the proposed legislation.  Reduced bike lanes and doubling the bridge size are short term solutions to a long-term problem ... and they are not even short-term because it will take a decade or more to construct either of them.  I encourage the Ontario government to think ahead and spend money on public transit solutions rather than solutions for cars.\n"

Prioritizing driving is both against the eco health of the city as well as the overall safety of bikers, who should be encouraged to bike rather than drive. Without bike lanes my safety and life is at risk.\n"

        "comment": "1. Removing existing bike lanes against the will of the municipalities in which those bike lanes are present is an abrogation of the democratic will of those cities, seemingly targeting Toronto in particular out of sheer spite.\n2. Forcing bicycles and automobiles into the same lanes will not improve the safety of either, as the deteriorating quality of driver skill and situational awareness will soon force both bicyclists and pedestrians to take greater measures to defend themselves. Drivers already don't respect the 1-meter rule.\n3. Removing existing bike lanes in Toronto will, based on observable rates of road construction progress, take longer than the Ford government will be in power, so even at a purely political level this will actually associate Ford with *less* road access for automobiles.\n4. It will not, in reality, improve transit times in Toronto one iota, and will most likely do the opposite.\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nAlthough I'm not a cyclist, I still sometimes use a bike to commute to work. I prefer this alternative when the TTC is slower and driving is even slower. The bike lanes provide a safer avenue to use the bike than riding next to a metal vehicle that has many blind spots for small objects.\nBike lanes do not take up that much space. I believe they are thinner than a parked car. which take up at least two lanes worth of space on Bloor.\nTo build a strong and transparent policy that benefits all people in Ontario, we should cost out the each alternative as well and evaluate the financial, human, and environmental cost for improving congestion problems.\n"

I'm sure I have nothing new to add -- businesses claim they do better with bike lanes, drivers feel safer with them, climate & pollution issues are addressed by bike lanes, though obviously not solved -- & so forth.\nHowever, I am a pedestrian...& what I notice is bicyclists using the sidewalks in places where there are no bike lanes, or using the pedestrian paths through parks, for their own safety. This feels unsafe to me as someone on foot. I know it could be said that bylaws could cover this, but how much enforcement is really available for such a thing?\nFinally one would like to get a clear statement that the \"old\" city of Toronto is valued in & for itself, & is not simply regarded as a resource for those who don't actually live there.\nthank you.\n"

First responders can't even get to hospitals with people that are dying in the ambulances.\nNot sure who is making these decisions to accommodate the handful of bikers out there, but what used to be a 15 minute trip across Bloor St. now takes 45 minutes.  This has to stop!\nThese bike lanes were the worst possible thing to happen to our beautiful city!\n"

        "comment": "I do not support this bill, and I oppose the plan to remove bike lanes from main streets in the City of Toronto. I believe these bike lanes are important and essential to protect cyclists. I do not believe that bike lanes cause gridlock. I am a cyclist and I cycle all year round. I live in downtown Toronto and I frequently use the bike lane network, including the bike lanes on main streets. I feel safer when using them. From what I have observed, the impact of bike lanes on traffic is negligible. Traffic is mostly caused by car lanes blocked by construction, parked or stopped cars. Are we going to remove all on-street parking at all times because it impedes the flow of traffic? Probably not. Finally, I believe this bill is an egregious example of provincial overreach in an area of municipal jurisdiction. The City of Toronto is best positioned to approve and manage bike lanes and road infrastructure within the city limits, especially in the downtown core. The bike lane network has already been studied and approved by City staff and by City Council. Please leave Toronto's bike lane network alone.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is not well thought out and in complete opposition to the strong mayor powers given to municipal mayors earlier in this governments term. Give mayors the powers to address these issues locally without the province stepping in. Additionally, Conservative governments should be about reducing red tape, not adding more. This will slow down the installation of all infrastructure when it is already extremely slow, and I would argue it will not reduce gridlock or save time.\nFinally, the way to reduce gridlock is to reduce car travel. There is a saying, 'you are not stuck in traffic, you are traffic'. If this provincial government made improvements and investments into public transit, and GoTrain services  we would see less cars on the road, and thus reduce gridlock while improving the environmental impacts, reducing fatalities and having longer lasting car/road infrastructure.\nThis car centric policy is short sighted and a myopic response to a situation which has existed for decades as the automobile boomed, and density was low. The problem will continue without further investment into public transportation systems to reduce traffic by providing affordable options to move large amounts of people to key areas, then offering them local transit solutions once they arrive at their destination.\n"

When I'm in the car, I know that cyclists are safe in their own lane and when I ride I feel protected. Gridlock is not caused by bike lanes. It's caused by too many cars on the road and construction shutting down lanes. Building up transit and bike infrastructure to encourage people to leave their cars at home is the only solution to gridlock. Ripping up exisiting infrastructure (some of it brand new) is offensive and stupid. I believe this proposal is a bald-faced attempt to make a road safety issue political and it's disgusting.\n"

        "comment": "While bike lanes have stolen most of the spotlight in this bill, I'd like to bring attention to a concerning provision tucked in:\nSCHEDULE 2 BUILDING HIGHWAYS FASTER ACT\n\u201cA provision prohibits registered owners from applying under the Expropriations Act for the adjustment of the date of possession for land that was expropriated by the Minister for the purposes of a priority highway project.\u201d\nThink about what this means. If the government decides to take your land for a \"priority\" highway project, you\u2019d lose the right to ask for more time to move or make arrangements. Farmers, homeowners, small business owners\u2014anyone affected by expropriation\u2014would be left with no say over when they\u2019re forced to leave.\nThis provision erodes fundamental fairness, giving the government unchecked authority to expropriate land on its own terms, regardless of the consequences for those affected. Infrastructure projects should serve the public good, but they should not trample on the rights of the very people they are meant to benefit. Yet somehow, when a Conservative MPP father\u2019s golf course was in the way of the Bradford Bypass, the route was conveniently adjusted. Ordinary Ontarians won't be afforded the same courtesy.\nIf this is how the government handles landowners today, what\u2019s next? It\u2019s time to call this out for what it is: an unnecessary and heavy-handed overreach.\n"

        "comment": "Keeping cities moving requires an intermodal means. That includes travel by all modes. Driving is time consuming and expensive. Removing bike lanes won't change that, but it will create unnecessary costs, and put the City of Toronto back into the 1960 urban planning mindset.\nToronto is a progressive cosmopolitan city, often voted in the top global cities based on quality of life ratings. It has long been reported that quality of life ratings attract real estate investment: https://lnkd.in/gwPeYNPi and location scores are often used to market real estate, including cycling scores.\nIf individual property wealth is positively affected by liveability rankings, this should dovetail to a stronger municipal tax base. If \"Traffic Commute Time Index\" is improved by the presence of bike lanes and more cyclists (which it is) then why are we reducing our property value with backward looking provincial planning ideas that overstep municipal planning authority.\nMakes no sense. No common sense.\n"

        "comment": "The bike lanes on Bloor St.,  Yonge St., and University Avenue should not be removed. There is absolutely no evidence this will reduce any of the perceived gridlock in Toronto. Traffic jams are reduced by reducing the number of vehicles in the road. This achieved through better public transit and other transportation options ie. Bikes. Bike lanes reduce injuries and save lives. The removal of these bike lanes appears to be more of part of personal grudges and political pandering than any legitimate, honest attempt to improve traffic issues in Toronto. This bill also represents a serious over reach of provincial powers. Given the majority of the Toronto City Council does not support this motion ot should be removed as part of this bill and should not proceed. As a resident of the City of Toronto proper I do not support this proposal.\n"

I have many employees who commute daily on the Bloor and Yonge protected bike lanes to go to work and to take kids to day care and school. They would never do that if the lanes were not protected. I also have employees who come to Toronto on the GO-Train and take the Bike Share bikes to work on University and Yonge. For 15 years, I have biked to various offices at Yonge and Eglinton, Yorkville and Yonge & Summerhill. It is only during the last 15 months that I have felt safe.\nWe cannot go back and rip up the bike lanes. They are game changers for everyone and a conduit to cleaner air and heartier lifestyles. As a growing, global metropolitan city, we do not need more cars. If there\u2019s enough trouble for the cars they will look for other solutions. I lived in Stockholm and London when they put in congestion charges as well as made it difficult for cars to get around. Guess what? It works!\nI have also heard from my local businesses and they thrive when people can drop in during their commutes as bike parking is free and available.\nPlease stop this stupidity.

I\u2019m a driver, taking Bloor street daily, but first and foremost I\u2019m mobilized (and vote alongside) matters of the planet. How could I not? What could possibly matter more than protecting our earth, our home, and our children from the devastating impacts of climate change. So, I\u2019m a driver, but I stand for bike lanes. If you build them, they will come. And I\u2019ll report that my partner has done just that. After the Bloor bike lanes were built, she started cycling to work. One less car on the road, one less emitter in motion - and might I add - a healthier citizen that is poised to require less healthcare than if she wasn\u2019t exercising this way on the daily. If you get rid of the Bloor bike lane, she will drive to work. She will have no choice. There will be thousands in the same position. The flagrant politicization of this issue, and disregard for common sense policy is frankly insulting. I have never felt so disgusted by a particular policy proposition, and frankly believe those who support it should take a long look in the mirror and ask if they truly believe they are acting in the best interest of the people of Ontario.\n"

It\u2019s just common sense.\u201d\nI believe that the reasons to remove the recently installed bike lanes on Bloor Street West between Jane and Islington have been well articulated in this recent petition and represent my point of view very well:\nhttps://www.change.org/p/re-evaluation-and-balanced-integration-of-bike\u2026\nThe comments posted by the public under \"Reasons for signing\" on that same petition page also capture many valid points.\n"
