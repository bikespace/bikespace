I use bike lanes every day and see them as essential infrastructure, just like sidewalks. Rather than focusing only on increasing car capacity, we need to prioritize safety and ensure options for vulnerable road users. When I drive, I'd much rather have cyclists in designated bike lanes than sharing the road. Bike lanes also complement transit investments by improving access to stations.\n"

        "comment": "This is a ridiculous proposal which is not in the interest of commuters, the environment, or affordability. Removing bike lanes will not improve traffic and will make for more cars on the road. This change makes roads/mobility inaccessible to all who don't drive because of age or wealth and will pollute our cities. This bill will not even save time for very long as car traffic will inevitably ramp up to match the available space: induced demand. The 401 is 16 lanes wide and has stop and go traffic we obviously do not need more lanes we need accessible and convenient cycling and public transit infrastructure.\n"

        "comment": "Numerous studies prove the only way to really reduce gridlock long-term is to reduce the numbers of vehicles. Better transit and active transportation infrastructure is the only way to do this. Traffic will expand to fill the space allotted for it. This is as true with extra lanes for cars over a period of a few years as is is for cycling infrastructure. So yes, reduce gridlock by making viable alternatives.\n"

        "comment": "Removing sections of the Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue bike lanes in the City of Toronto and return them to a lane of traffic for motor vehicles is wrong.  It has been proven over and over again, that adding new lanes to streets doesn't relieve congestion.  Bikes need a safe place to ride all over the city.  We should be adding more bike lanes so that the new bike lanes can feed the existing ones.  Why is on Ontario government not allowing the City of Toronto and other municipalities decide what's best for them.  Removing bike lane infrastructure is a huge waste of money.  Bike rentals is increasing in Toronto, which is a good thing.  The government should be looking forward and not looking backwards.  We should be spending money on public transit (subway, LRT, bus, bike lanes, sidewalks, etc) and not be wasting money prioritizing cars.  Lets get upgrade public transit so that we can become a cleaner and more friendly city.\n"

        "comment": "To whom it may concern,\nAs a frequent driver into and around Toronto for the past 20 years, I'm extremely disappointed to hear about the reduction of bike lanes.\nWhen commuting from Durham into Toronto, traffic would often back-up along the 401 and DVP, but the worst part of the drive had always been on Toronto streets with bike riders swaying in an out of traffic lanes and causing large back-ups as cars fought to get around the bike riders safely.\nThis has been completely transformed with bike lanes in some areas. The use of bike lanes allows cars to pass freely without the worry of a bike rider leaning just a little too far left as we pass. There has also been a noticeable improvement in travel times through these areas.\nGive these bike riders their own space so that drivers can use ours properly and without worry. The absence of bike lanes will not eliminate bike riders, it will only make things slower and riskier for both groups.\n"

        "comment": "Hi,\nBill 212 is a foolish backward movement with regard to bike lanes. I strongly suggest we strike it down.\nFirst, the provincial government has no right to be meddling in the affairs of municipal matters, like bike lanes. Why add red-tape and bureaucracy to local governments wanting to increase transportation options? Bike lanes are an essential form of traffic for those who: don't want to drive, don't have cars, want to exercise, want to reduce emissions and so on.\nWhat's more, bike lanes keep cyclists out of the way of cars. If the bike lanes are removed, and all cyclists start \"taking the lane\", I see far worse issues with traffic. Each bike is one less car in front of you, Doug Ford.\nDoug Ford: why don't you hop on your bike (well, get one first, I presume you don't have one), and bike to work instead of sitting behind traffic? Be part of the solution, not part of the problem. And don't make the problem worse for everybody else, including yourself.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose the proposed bill to remove bike lanes that I use daily for commuting. These lanes provide a safe, efficient, and healthy alternative for travel, reducing the need for cars and alleviating congestion. Removing them would undermine the progress made towards a more bike-friendly city and negatively impact many who rely on them for their daily commute. Many people, like myself, only became comfortable with biking as an alternative to Ubers because of the infrastructure that was created to ensure our safety. Taking out these lanes will add more cars on the road, contradicting your objective of alleviating congestion. The statistics quoted on the number of users are extremely out of date and are not a reflection of the popularity of bike lanes today. The benefits of keeping these bike lanes far outweigh any marginal gains from their removal and I implore the Ford government to use our tax payer dollars in a more productive manner.\n"

        "comment": "The proposed removal of bike lanes in Toronto under Premier Doug Ford's administration is a concerning move that could have far-reaching negative consequences for the city and its residents. One of the primary reasons bike lanes are essential to Toronto's infrastructure is their ability to provide safe and accessible transportation options for cyclists, scooters, and other mobility devices\u2014for all those who cannot drive or prefer not to do so. Bike lanes promote physical activity, reduce air pollution, and alleviate traffic congestion on main roads. By removing bike lanes, Premier Ford would be undoing a crucial step towards creating a more sustainable, equitable, and livable city.\nFurthermore, the removal of bike lanes would disproportionately affect vulnerable populations, such as low-income residents, seniors, and people with disabilities who rely heavily on cycling for transportation due to lack of alternative options. It would also undermine efforts to reduce car dependency, decrease traffic fatalities, and promote community engagement through cycling. Moreover, Toronto's bike lane system has made great strides in its infrastructure; its removal would put the city at risk of losing its reputation as an example of what car-alternative life can be. By preserving and expanding bike lanes, Premier Ford should prioritize the needs and well-being of Torontonians over short-term political gains or ideology-driven agendas.\nFurther, the Ontario provincial government is overstepping its bounds by meddling in the affairs of municipal governments.\nPlease think this through. Discard Bill 212.\n"

        "comment": "I am a married 65 year old retired Respiratory Therapist and Healthcare Manager with a 24 yr old daughter. Our family are cyclists living in downtown Toronto. I have lived in this area for over 40 years. I drive, take transit, walk and cycle. Driving is typically done for large grocery runs or leaving the city. I find cycling to be the most efficient way to get around the city. When my daughter was very young, she sat on her \"Trail-a-bike\" behind me as we went back and forth to her school, daycare and summer camps at Harbourfront. When she was old enough to ride her own bike, we did the same. During her summers at Harbourfront camps, there was quite a bit of construction on Queens Quay Blvd. I taught her how to successfully maneuver around the most dangerous areas. After dropping her off, I had to ride north to my job in a downtown teaching hospital. I had a choice: Simcoe St was only useful for part of the journey as it became a one way street southbound at some point. (I would not break the law and go against traffic like so many do). I would have to then move over to University Avenue. I was actually afraid everyday as I did this route. How I would have loved the bike lanes that go all the way along University Avenue. If these bike lanes are removed, how should cyclists get to work or appointments - In busy traffic (which was gridlocked long before the bike lanes)? or perhaps move over to Bay? Yonge? We will go back to having no safe route to work.     Fast-forward to my daughter's high school years. She attended Etobicoke School for the Arts - quite a distance from our downtown condo. She asked me if she could ride her bike instead of taking the bus + subway + bus everyday, both ways. My answer was NO. Her choices would have been Queensway (no bike lanes! - even now the bike lanes only go as far west as the Food Terminal - after which cyclists get to share the road with transport trucks full of veggies - going at least 60K/hr.) The other option was Bloor (no bike lanes at the time!.) If the Bloor bike lanes had existed when she was in high school i would have said yes! - she would have been riding. My daughter is an excellent cyclist. She consistently wears her helmet and obeys all the rules of the road. She was DEVASTATED when her friend and fellow dancer was killed while riding her bike on Dufferin St in Dec 2020. Thinking about it still brings me to tears. She could have been anybody's daughter. She was responsibly navigating traffic and just trying to get home. She would likely be alive today if there had been bike lanes. Our city is doing their best to extend the network of bike lanes to protect all commuters (drivers, transit riders, pedestrians and cyclists.) I applaud these efforts and say \"full steam ahead\". The best way to reduce gridlock is to get as many people as possible out of their cars. Some will always need to drive - but many could easily take the aforementioned means of transportation. If bike lanes are not installed or foolishly taken out, then parents like me will once again tell their children not to cycle to school, and I will once again be very afraid while out and about. I want my daughter and everyone else to be safe on the roads. Your Minister of Transportation suggested that bike lanes should be on \"side streets\". Where is the side street that goes from downtown Toronto to the West end of the city. I see Bloor on the north end of High Park and Queensway on the south end. There are NO side streets to travel west. How far out the their way should a cyclist have to detour? Travelling east is no better. If bike lanes are removed from Bloor - how should we cross the DVP? Gerard? Queen? Not without bike lanes. Your plan will put more people back in cars and increase gridlock. The common sense thing to do is to continue expanding the cycling network. It is good for the environment, the economy (we cyclists actually spend that money that we don't spend on gas), and it is very good for keeping traffic moving.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to share my concerns with the proposed Bill 212, \"Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024\". As a resident of Ottawa, I am strongly opposed to this proposed bill and urge the provincial government and urge for its withdrawal, for several reasons:\n1. Extensive academic studies have shown that cycling lanes help reduce traffic congestion, not increase them, even if a lane of motor vehicle traffic is removed. Because of the induced demand that adding cycling lanes generate, more people will choose to ride a bicycle rather than drive, leading to a modal share shift away from driving and reducing the volume of cars. Cycling is simply much more space-efficient than driving, enabling more people to move in the same geometric space than if they were in cars. Please see the attached PDF \"latest-evidence-on-induced-travel-demand-an-evidence-review\" as an example.\n2. By separating cyclist and motor traffic into their own lanes, roads are made significantly safer for all of drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians. Drivers will not have to worry about cyclists blocking their lane if there are separate cycling lanes. This is particularly important for children who cycle to school, who deserve safe, high-quality cycling infrastructure to avoid collisions.\n3. The government should not introduce extra red tape and bureaucracy to a municipal issue by mandating an extra level of review for cycling lanes. This is an inefficient use of taxpayer dollars and amounts to micromanaging local concerns that are best dealt with by local municipalities.\n4. Cycling lanes support existing transit infrastructure and ongoing transit investments such as Ottawa's LRT Stage 2, the Eglinton Crosstown, and Ontario Line, by making it easier for people to reach transit stations. In doing so, more people are encouraged to take public transit, further taking cars off the road and reducing traffic congestion.\n5. Surveys such as the official Ottawa Cycling Plan (2013, see link) have shown that there is significant potential demand for cycling among residents of Ontario's major urban centres, but a lack of proper cycling infrastructure prevents them from doing so. In the 2013 survey, for example, 40% of respondents stated that better cycling facilities such as bike lanes would encourage them to cycle.\n6. Adding cycling lanes encourage more people to frequent businesses on the streets they are located on, stimulating the local economy and supporting small businesses. For example, the Toronto Centre for Active Transportation (2019)found that the addition of cycling lanes on Bloor Street led to not only a higher volume of customers visiting local businesses, but also that those customers spent more on average (see attached).\nThank you for your consideration on this urgent issue. Cycling lanes are vital to vibrant, safe, and economically sound communities. The Government of Ontario should be advancing policy that supports, not inhibits, cycling lanes.\n"

        "comment": "We need bike lanes, and this bill directly affects the implementation and growth of them. Too reduce gridlock, removing bike lanes and widening existing motorist lanes will not help the issue, it will only have it grow worse. By adding more car lanes, ones only inducing more car traffic, further clogging up an already full traffic way. If you truly want to solve traffic, remove the problem in the first place, cars. By getting more people to take alternative modes of transit, (bikes, trams, metro etc.) you free up space on the already cramped roads, improving the speed and accessibility for everyone using the roads. Let alone make it safer for everyone in all sorts of walks of life to travel.\n"

        "comment": "The proposed bill would be a disaster for Ontario's climate, mode-share, and road safety goals and should not pass. Hostility to bicycle infrastructure is not only a wild overreach of the province into municipal matters but a direct contravention of Ontario's and Canada's pledge to facilitate non-car modes of transit, AND it condemns the entire province to ever-increasing motorist gridlock by worsening the experience of anyone who would dare try to get somewhere without driving.\nCyclists are, as yet, a relatively low number of road users, and cyclists are disproportionately vulnerable to hostile interactions with motor vehicles. This increases dramatically when bicycle lanes, especially the sorts of high-quality lanes directly targeted for prevention or removal by this bill, are not available and cyclists are forced to mingle with motorists in the same lanes. Not only that, but the lower top speed of cyclists means that, in many cases, forcing cyclists to share the same lanes as motorists slows motorists, too, all while putting cyclists in danger. Ontario's cycling networks are young, piecemeal, and not yet the draw that they can and should be BECAUSE they are young and piecemeal, and even so, cycling has rapidly increased in popularity in the past few years. Separating cyclists from motorists and pedestrians alike, by providing high-quality bike lanes in an interconnected network that should aspire to be on par with the existing road network for motorists, makes the experience of being out in public better for cyclists, motorists, and pedestrians alike. Mandating that the province regard any bike lane as an impediment to motorists and judging them entirely on that metric is backward, anti-science (all the best urban science indicates that cycling facilities make traffic FASTER, not SLOWER, for ALL road users), and a direct attempt to pit motorists against cyclists for political gain. It is telling that the bill contains no consideration whatsoever for the safety, speed, or convenience of cyclists while mandating that the province interfere with any bike lane it can imagine would even slightly inconvenience a motorist.\nFurthermore, the claim that cyclists are bad for business is simply false. Time and time again, the results show themselves: there is more space for business when places are built for cyclists than when they count on motorists. Berths for bicycles take far, FAR less space than parked cars and stopping for a quick shopping trip or restaurant outing is a much simpler matter for cyclists than motorists. For the same reason that pedestrianizing streets has overwhelmingly positive impacts on nearby businesses, cycling infrastructure is a boon, not a danger, to the economics of nearby businesses.\nThis bill is destructive, spiteful politics at its worst and it MUST fail for the good of the province. A long, beautiful future for all road users depends on that failure.\n"
