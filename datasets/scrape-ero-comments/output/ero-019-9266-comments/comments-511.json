Can you share a study that shows the opposite, i.e. a scientific study showing that adding more lanes to cars actually decreases traffic congestion?\nIn addition, do you have a rigorous plan to evaluate the impact of the proposed changes? In location where you will remove bike lanes and add more lanes to cars, do you plan to evaluate the impact on traffic congestion before and after?\nThank you.\n"

        "comment": "As residents, pedestrians, drivers and cyclists of Toronto, we are writing to express our strongest opposition to Bill 212 that will create more hazardous roads, increase air and noise pollution without solving the congestion problem the city faces. Our major grief is that the elimination of bike lanes on these major streets will directly result in deaths of cyclists, leaving the provincial government with blood on their hands.\nWe also believe the proposed legislation is a direct assault on local democracy and governance as it rushes to conclusion before reasoning, and represents an unprecedented jurisdictional overreach into local affairs, particularly the largest, most diverse and financially important city in Ontario.\nRemoving bike lanes by legislation will increase congestion. The added construction will add travel time to both drivers and cyclists alike. Also, there is no data or evidence that supports that removing bike lanes on University, Yonge and Bloor will decrease driving time when a lot of the congestion is caused by construction and more cars on the road. It is also wasteful and fiscally irresponsible to spend taxpayer money to tear out newly constructed infrastructure.\nRemoving bike lanes is bad for business, particularly small businesses on the bike lanes that will bear the impact. This will lead to a loss of patrons as the roads are torn up. Additionally, as the Annex BIA stated, cyclists have more frequent and spontaneous stops along their route that will lead to more customers. Building the street as wide as possible for thoroughfare means more cars travelling through, not more business.\nCyclists and drivers will be endangered by the inevitable mixed traffic. Cyclists will always exist, whether you give them bike lanes or not. There will only be more cyclists as more people move to the large cities. Additionally, the principle of induced demand also means that simply by having an additional lane it will not necessarily lead to better travel times. This is particularly true as the legislation potentially forces more drivers onto the road because they have no alternative mode of transportation but to drive.\nCycling is part of the fabric of the transit system that will connect the last mile of transit use, especially considering how we have underinvested in subways and heavy rail transit in the past decades. While the historic investment into public transit by this government is laudable, it is also late. In any case, we still need micro mobility transport modes to connect transit users to their final destinations. With the booming population of Ontario and Toronto, more people are cycling not only to commute, but also to visit friends, families and businesses. The statistics of 1.2% of commuters being cyclists is misleading and outdated from 2011 when in fact we need more up to date statistics that encompasses all journeys, not just commuting. Particularly in large downtowns like that of Toronto, more density in housing and population simply means there is no room for everyone to drive for every trip. Cycling takes up less space and is more efficient at moving people in dense urban areas when we are facing an acute housing crisis. It seems folly to think devoting more space to roads is the solution to our population and housing problem when we simply do not have enough space for everyone to drive for every purpose.\nWe, the undersigned, implore you to pause Bill 212 that would make cities in Ontario, including Toronto, less competitive, livable and safe for all residents.\nSincerely,\nRoss\n"

Please don't waste resources removing infrastructure that is complete that gives people an option for a safe alternative to driving.\nWhy doesn't this government focus on getting the Eglinton crosstown line finished and helping people see the positives that come from providing transportation alternatives.\nStop scapegoating people who cycle for transportation. This is a legitimate means of transport that is especially effective in cities and should be encouraged not disparaged.\nDoug Ford's should stay in his lane and stop meddling in city affairs just because he thinks his commute is too slow. He lives in Etobicoke and could easily use the bike lanes himself instead of railing against them.\n"

This is ironic given the provincial government calls itself conservative and claims to value things like the reduction of red tape and bureaucracy. Beyond the obvious ideological incoherence of the bill, there are practical problems. First, better bike infrastructure REDUCES road congestion by reducing the number of people driving. Improving bike infrastructure and getting more people out biking keeps people healthy, lets individuals decide for themselves how they want to travel, and allows them to save money which they can put back into their local economy. Surely better health, investment in the local economy, and personal autonomy are principles that a \"conservative\" government would want to promote.\n"

I bike to work ever day along the Bloor and university bike lanes. I've started doing that because there are safe lanes that make me feel comfortable biking. I've found that biking is such a great addition to my day: it's good exercise, a great way to start the day, better for the environment, it's faster than driving, I've bonded with colleagues who else bike. And since my confidence has grown with biking (due to the safe lanes that have been put in) I've gotten around the city more, engaged with more activities in the city.\nRemoving bike lanes is dangerous and will not help the congestion in the city!! Reducing the number of cars driving in the core will help reduce congestion and individuals who bike help do that!!!\nThe construction that would be created by taking out these bike lanes would also create more congestion -- focus your attention on bills that would actually help support this province but taking away safe, reliable means of transportation is just stupid.\nBe grateful that many Torontonians are biking around the city, instead of each individual one driving or ubering everywhere, which would guaranteed increase congestion.\n"

This could have provided the province a mandate to remove the bike lanes. Re-applying the King's Highway designation, and adding new ones across the province, will re-instate the mandate of the province over these important streets without resorting to politics.\nIntroducing this new contentious framework will take too long when the Hon. Prabmeet Singh and the bill's supporters have demonstrated through research, traffic studies, and hard work that removing these bike lanes will immediately resolve gridlock.\nWe have a framework ready to go. It is called a provincial highway and it is the way forward for the province on this issue, not this bill.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes would be dangerous and deadly, and it would be especially dangerous and deadly if it were to happen on busy city streets like Bloor St., Yonge St. and University Ave. in Toronto (as Doug Ford has already stated he will do, against the will of Toronto\u2019s City Council).\nI myself have personal experience of the dangers posed to cyclists when there are no bike lanes on busy city streets, as I was hit by a car while cycling on Bloor St. in October 2014 between Bathurst and Spadina, before a bike lane was installed along that stretch of Bloor. This collision happened because a driver didn\u2019t signal or check his blind spot before trying to park nose first along the street while I was riding my bike to the right of his car, and because there were no separated bike lanes at the time. This resulted in me suffering a dislocated right shoulder that required a trip to the ER at Toronto Western Hospital to reset my shoulder; I have suffered permanent nerve damage to my right arm and right hand ever since.\nTHIS TYPE OF COLLISION WOULD NOT HAPPEN TODAY ON THE SECTION OF BLOOR ST. WHERE I WAS HIT BY A CAR BECAUSE THE BIKE LANES THAT HAVE BEEN INSTALLED THERE SINCE THEN PROVIDE A PROTECTIVE BARRIER FOR CYCLISTS FROM CAR TRAFFIC. However, THIS TYPE OF DANGEROUS COLLISION WILL HAPPEN AGAIN IF BIKE LANES ARE REMOVED FROM BUSY STREETS LIKE BLOOR ST. Even worse, deadly collisions that kill cyclists will continue to occur on city streets that have no bike lanes.\nBeyond the question of safety, the Ford government\u2019s proposal to remove bike lanes further infringes on the role of municipal governments to make decisions that are in the best interests of their residents. Furthermore, their claims that bike lanes increase congestion, have a negative impact on local businesses and prevent emergency services from reaching people in distress in a timely fashion are simply not backed by data. In fact, the available data show that the opposite is true in terms of bike lanes easing congestion and having a positive impact on local businesses, and that bike lanes do not prevent emergency services from reaching people in need. Removing bike lanes will make emergency services busier, however, as ambulances and police officers will have to deal with the increasing number of collisions between cyclists and cars that will result in a far greater number of preventable serious injuries and deaths on city streets. The Ford government\u2019s baseless claims are, therefore, nothing more than a craven attempt to score political points with drivers that will have dangerous and fatal consequences.\nLeave our municipal governments and our bike lanes alone! Please, Mr. Ford, stay in your lane!\n"

        "comment": "I currently lived in the Annex and previously lived at Yonge and St. Clair when the Yonge bike lanes were implemented. I am a driver,pedestrian, and transit user and only use the bike lanes occasionally.\nI wholly support the bike lanes and think it would be a mistake to remove them. The bike lines improve the quality of the street-scape on all the streets, making it safer and more pleasant for both pedestrians and cyclists. As someone who mostly walks, I am more likely to frequent my local business if the street scape is more pleasant to walk along, and has fewer cars. When I walk with my nephew in the area, it feels safer with the bike lanes, as there is more of a division between us and traffic.\nI agree that congestion is a problem in the City. However, there is ample evidence which shows that removing bike-lanes will not improve congestion in the City, and in fact bike lanes are  more efficient at moving people than car lanes are (https://nacto.org/publication/transit-street-design-guide/introduction/\u2026). The weather is often raised as a concern, but I see people biking all year round, and personally I walk to work most of the year regardless of the weather. There are only a handful of days where the weather is inhospitable to biking, and winter weather especially can usually be mitigated with proper snow/ice clearing.\nRather than ripping up bike lanes that already exist, which will cost money, and won't meaninfully solve the problem, the government should focus on funding initatives that are proven to work such as increasing funding and frequency of public transit. In a growing city, we cannot build enough roads for everyone to drive everywhere without gridlock - its a physics problem. Cars take up more room than people.\nProcedurally, it is unclear why we should make it more complicated and difficult to build bike-lanes. This is appropriately within the jurisidction of the relevant cities who can decide for themselves whether the bike lanes are appropriate based on their unique circumastances. In the City of Toronto, before bike lanes are implemented there are ample studies on placement, traffic, parking etc. Another step will only slow down, and add expense to what is already a thorough process. In addition, Toronto has repeatedly voted for bike lanes.\nFinally, adding a lane of traffic, that will likely only be used for parking anyway will likely only increase traffic as people will be forced to change lanes, which increases traffic and congestion.\n"

        "comment": "The proposal is absurd, and seems to be entirely divorced from reality. I tried searching for studies showing that bike lanes are contributing to traffic congestion here, to see how much of a problem is being addressed, and instead found dozens of studies showing the exact opposite. This makes perfect sense when you stop to think about it, since the more space there is for cyclists, the fewer cars there are adding to congestion. Instead, the proposal seems to position the Ontario legislature as knowing more about local conditions than both the respective municipalities and literal experts on traffic, but gives no reason why. Unless the aim is to make our lives objectively worse, this proposal has to be the most clear example of just unarguably bad government policy I've seen from this government. I really have tried to understand the reasoning behind it, but am at a complete loss.\n"

I have replaced most of my trips with Bike Share, year round.\nI am effectively one less car on the road, I am more active and I am healthier than ever.\nWhen they're used by a large number of people, bike lane networks have been shown to reduce traffic, reduce pollution and to promote good public health.\nThe key to increasing bike lane usage is to build complete protected networks. Toronto was not built in a grid, so huge areas of the city, especially just outside of downtown, don't have alternative local streets where bike lanes could be installed.\nIMPORTANT: THERE ARE NO ALTERNATIVE SAFE AND DIRECT PATHS TO THE YONGE ST BIKE LANE, SO I WILL BE FORCED TO DRIVE MY CAR AGAIN, INCREASING CONGESTION.\nCities, including Toronto, have shown time and time again that building these networks attract people and take them out of cars. Just look at rush hour on Bloor St. near downtown and you'll see that bike lanes can barely fit into the existing lanes near traffic lights. IMAGINE THE CHAOS IF ALL THESE PEOPLE WERE DRIVING CARS INSTEAD.\nNotably, the Yonge St. bike lane only removed car lanes in very specific parts, it's a very narrow lane in the first place. These parts of yonge st are not the bottleneck of the road system, so removing car lanes effectively made little difference in traffic. Additionally a good amount of the lanes removed were previously reserved for parking.\nI oppose bill 212 and I urge the Premier to let cities control their own roads.\nI also urge the Premier to issue a blanked approval on the usage of automated traffic enforcement measures, such as cameras to prevent Blocking the Box - an issue that actually causes significant congestion in Toronto.\n"

        "comment": "The proposed amendment that will require the removal of bike lanes on Bloor, Yonge and University appears to be completely arbitrary in targeting certain infrastructure before any consideration of expert advice or evidence relating to those specific facilities.\nHence the proposed amendment clumsily contradicts and undermines the Province's original proposal which describes a framework that would be created to assess existing and proposed bike lanes in the City by reviewing information provided to the Province. The Province's original proposal described an approval for existing/new bike lanes \"...based on a set of specified criteria, to be set out in guidance and/or regulation.\" In other words, a clear intention to create \"due process\" for any potential removal of bike lanes.\nBut the new amendment prescribes the removal of the Bloor/Yonge/University bike lane infrastructure before any such 'due process' is allowed to even commence.  On what basis are these particular lanes being identified as needing removal? I assume on the basis of the intuition of political leaders in the Province and/or based on ad hoc commentary from constituents who have no expertise in urban transport planning or highway safety.\nThe amendment therefore apparently directs government to expend public funds, management time and effort to manage the destruction of existing costly public infrastructure based on no process or substantiated fact-based evidence to support such action or to understand the socio-economic impacts on the wider community - a fairly good definition of grossly negligent governance.\nAnd therefore why should City taxpayers be exposed to legal actions arising when such negligent government action results in death or injury to cyclists or pedestrians.\nIf this incompetent amendment cannot be withdrawn entirely on the grounds of it undermining the basic concept of 'due process' then it invites the logical question that if the Province judges a formal review process is of so little value for these particular bike lanes, then why doesn't the Province save us all a lot of time and taxpayer money by just directing all existing bike lanes to be destroyed with no further review process? And it shall be done, like a wise King's command.\nIf a formal review process has already occurred on these specified bike lanes then please share details with taxpayers so they are able to understand how due process is protecting their tax dollars.\nIf this illogical amendment is not withdrawn, then will the Province at least consider the following additions to the original proposal and/or the amendment to at least put some responsibility back on the Province for any adverse outcomes arising from its imposed actions and to give local planners the best chance to meet the demands of drivers and the local community:\n1. The Province will reimburse the City of Toronto (or other applicable local authority) for all validated direct costs relating to any bike lane assessments processes and/or removals as prescribed by the Act;\n2. The Province will indemnify the City of Toronto (or other applicable local authority) for all criminal or civil liability arising from death or injuries deemed by a Court to have been caused by the removal of the bike lane infrastructure; and\n2. The Province to add to the stated exemption from the Environmental Assessment Act (for the prescribed removal of the Bloor/Yonge/University bike lanes) by also exempting bike lane reviews (whether existing lanes or new proposed lanes) from any Provincial laws/regulations that require individual lanes for vehicular traffic to be of a defined minimum width. In other words, to allow flexibility for planners to consider in these specific situations an alternative solution - the possibility of less wide traffic lanes to allow in this specific locations the accommodation of both an additional traffic lane as well as maintaining the assessed bike lane (existing or proposed).\n"
