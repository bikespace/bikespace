        "comment": "Hi there,\nPlease, please reconsider removing bike lanes on Bloor St W. Bloor is by far one of the safest bike commutes in all of Toronto because of the bike lanes!\nI love this city and part of the reason why is because of Bloor St W and its culture. The bike lanes are an integral part of the Bloor St W culture - a young, hip neighbourhood where walking and cycling are how a large majority of people commute to work, school, home, and their local cafe or thrift store.\nThe congestion of Bloor is nothing compared to Eglinton Ave (and Eglinton doesn\u2019t have bike lanes). By removing bike lanes on Bloor, you will effectively be putting cyclists at risk without a barrier to help shield them from the countless erratic, distracted, road-raging drivers Toronto has these days. If you think Bloor is congested now, just wait and see what happens if you remove the bike lanes.\nPlease reconsider. Please don\u2019t take away our bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "I would like to provide my thoughts on the proposal to strip away the bike lanes on Bay Street and other Toronto arterial roads and the proposed law to give the province the mandate to remove bike lanes in other municipalities and to require approval for new lanes that take away a lane for car traffic.\nI believe that this intrusion by the province into traffic design at the local level is unwarranted. It would seem that a Toronto-centric view of the world is being foisted on the rest of the province. There has not been hue and cry raised in municipality after municipality against recent improvements to bicycle infrastructure. It would seem that Toronto challenges with car traffic volume is dictating policy across the province where conditions are very different. Indeed, one could not be blamed for feeling this legislation seems to treat traffic design as something that can be solved as easily as sending out a crew to fill a few potholes.\nThe GTA currently has three significant transit projects underway. All of them are massively behind schedule, with no implementation dates in sight. Likely all of them are significantly over budget, although public reporting is non-existent. All of them are managed by Metrolinx. Surely, resources and talent should be focused on fixing the province\u2019s inability to deliver transit systems reliably, on time and on budget. Further, there are plans to finally electrify parts of the GO system. Getting this project underway and successfully delivered will be an enormous challenge for Metrolinx. These are truly provincial-level initiatives that should be the focus, not municipal road design.\nTo the issue of the Toronto bike lanes.\nThe implementation of these lanes was done through a robust process, involving all stakeholders and supported by in-depth research. Research that showed how streets with cycle paths supported the retail business on the street better than streets without cycle paths. Cars just drive by. Buses don\u2019t stop at all the shops. Stores are invisible to subways. Removing the cycle lanes will have a negative effect on businesses in these corridors. All that research has been done. It is unclear why the government is so against the small businesses on, for example, Bloor Street.\nThe Bloor Steet cycle path is very well used. Obviously, more connectivity is required to increase its use even further. Already the cycle volume would equate to a very, very well used bus route, one of the busiest in the TTC network. However, removing the cycle path would not put all these people on the busses. Some would continue to cycle, at much greater risk of personal injury. Others would get into cars and create more grid lock. The car, the bicycle and walking share a key advantage over buses and subways \u2013 they get you right to your destination. This is a very valuable attribute.\nHow much time does the government think will be saved by car drivers should be bike lane be removed? I believe it would not be more than one minute per car per trip. Even one minute is unlikely to happen. What is the most likely outcome is that more cars will fill up the road and the gridlock will be as bad. But we will all be poorer for not having the option for a safe, effective, zero emission bike lane. And some cyclists will die. How much quicker does a car trip down Bloor Street have to be to be worth the injuries and deaths that are certain to occur?\nWe are just starting the adoption of electric bikes in Canada. Electric bikes will bring more people to commuting by bike. The increased ease, the increased speed and the lack of building up a big sweat makes e-biking very attractive. The province should, if anything, be preparing for a sharp increase in cycling in the coming years rather than short-shortsightedly removing what cycling infrastructure has been developed.\nI understand that there is frustration with gridlock at certain times of the day. The problem is not too many bikes; rather it is too many cars. Gridlock is actually reduced when more of us cycle. Perhaps we should be looking at what other cities have done to reduce gridlock by reducing car traffic. Some samples I am familiar with:\n1.\tEliminate all free street parking, aside from residents. Victoria gave all students to the end of high school free bus passes, funded by eliminating free street parking and charging for parking 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n2.\tCongestion charges are used in London England to reduce car traffic in targeted areas. Toronto could place tolls on cars coming into the downtown on the major expressways. Implement a toll at the downtown off-ramps to encourage people to park outside the downtown and take transit.\n3.\tOn a trip to downtown Den Hague, Holland, we parked at a parking garage outside of the city core for 2 Euros for the day. Our parking ticket entitled 4 people to take transit into and out of the downtown. A frequent, quick light rail system took us to the downtown. Could Toronto do that? Could Metrolinx deliver the supporting transit?\n4.\tAt the baggage carousel in the Geneva airport there is a transit voucher dispenser. Just take a voucher and ride transit for free to your destination. On checking into your hotel, you are provided free transit passes for the duration of your trip, eliminating the need to rent a car.\n5.\tOn our trip to Tokyo, the largest metropolitan center in the world with about 80% of Canada\u2019s entire population we noticed that there was no gridlock. Most of the city traffic was cabs, delivery vehicles and service/emergency vehicles. How do they do it? Excellent mass transit, tolled highways and restricted parking capacity.\n6.\tIn Holland, we cycle to and from Schiphol Airport. We cycled to and from the Vienna Airport. We cycled out of Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris and to the Bordeau Airport. Unthinkable in Toronto. Why? Because the cycling network is only now starting to be developed. We need more cycling infrastructure and better options for the people currently stuck in their cars. Not less infrastructure and no alternative other than the car.\n7.\tFrom Paris to Amsterdam to Montreal to Copenhagen to Ottawa, truly world class cities have incredible cycling infrastructure that is connected, wide-spread and safe. Again, Toronto is way, way behind. This proposal would put us even further behind.\n8.\tThe government has stated that cycling infrastructure does not belong on arterial roads and should be moved to secondary roads. In some cases that might work, and Toronto has been doing exactly that in many places. If the government believes this is a feasible solution for the bike lanes on Toronto\u2019s arterial roads, then the provincial government should build the new, direct, connected and safe cycle paths on secondary roads before removing the existing infrastructure. Perhaps Metrolinx could be put in charge of building such a network.\n9.\tFrom the west, we have a number of alternatives to go to and through Toronto. All the expressways are very, very busy. The 401 through Toronto is the busiest highway in the world. That is not a badge of honour. It\u2019s a travesty and a disaster. Of course, there is one exception. The 407ETR that a Conservative government sold without guarantees on the rate of increase of tolls is dramatically underused. The 407ETR had revenues of $450.3M and net income of $187.3M in 2023. 41% of their revenue went to profits after tax. I don\u2019t know of any other business that has more than 40% of their revenue on the bottom line. It\u2019s obscene. Meanwhile, more traffic pours onto the 401, the 403 and the QEW/Gardiner than they can possibly handle, creating truly world class gridlock that is not caused by a few cycle lanes. It is time that this government take steps to fix the 407TR problem created by their predecessor.  That\u2019s a problem requiring the attention of the province, unlike municipal bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "I firmly believe that the provincial government is overreacting in its jurisdiction. The statistics that the transportation minister of Ontario stated are quite outdated and do not reflect the current state of biking in Toronto. In downntown Toronto, as of 2021, 8% of people regularly commute using bikes. That data is from 2021. Since then, bike share Toronto has doubled in use. That is the amount of people who decide to bike instead of driving, which is the amount of cars off the road. I regularly use Bloor and University as the lanes are well protected and make me feel safe when biking. Please do not take them away.\n"

        "comment": "Biking is important! Please do not remove bike lanes. The removal of bike lanes makes biking much more dangerous, and it puts bikes and cars in the same lanes which can slow traffic even further.\nMore car lanes would mean more cars driving, which still results in crowded roads. Bikes are an important alternative and are more practical for short trips. Bikes also mean no need for car parking.\nIf you want to reduce congestion in roads, put more effort into public transportation: buses, subways, and trains.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my concerns about the proposed bill to remove bike lanes. This bill seems to add unnecessary red tape and bureaucracy, hindering local governments that are striving to enhance transportation options for their communities. By obstructing these efforts, the provincial government risks stalling progress towards more sustainable and efficient urban mobility solutions. It is crucial that we prioritize the safety and accessibility of all road users, particularly the most vulnerable, rather than focusing solely on maximizing car traffic. Bike lanes play a vital role in ensuring that cyclists have a safe space on the roads, reducing the likelihood of accidents and promoting a more inclusive transportation network.\nMoreover, as a driver, I find it preferable for cyclists to have their own designated lanes, which helps keep them out of the main flow of traffic and enhances overall road safety. Additionally, bike lanes complement public transit investments by facilitating easier access to transit stations, thereby encouraging the use of public transportation. This integration of cycling infrastructure with transit systems can lead to a more connected and efficient transportation network, ultimately benefiting the entire community. I urge you to reconsider the implications of this bill and support policies that promote diverse and safe transportation options for all.\n"

If we really want to solve traffic, we should stop underfunding the TTC and provide more alternative methods of transit, rather than trying to add more lanes which never works because of induced demand.\n"

All evidence shows CONGESTION IS NOT IMPROVED WITH REMOVING BIKE LANES. Vehicular traffic merely fills the vacant lane. Pushing cyclists INTO traffic makes everyone LESS SAFE. Why is the Ford government putting people\u2019s lives over perceived commute times??  I cycle every single day in this city, often on the bike lanes scheduled to be removed. They are well used, and keep cyclists separate from car traffic making everyone SAFER and allowing traffic to flow smoother. After so many studies, why is the Ford government ignoring this data?  No one who actually lives and works in Toronto want to see more car traffic and cyclists forced into traffic. Why does the Ford government ignore the citizenry and the data experts?  Stop this HARMFUL bill now\u2026before some car hits me on the way to work, a way in which I USED to be protected. SHAME.\n"

        "comment": "Good morning,\nI have two points to contribute\n1. To keep cities, particularly Toronto, vibrant, and to continue to accommodate the population the density of cities must increase. Given the existing infrastructure transportation by car cannot be the focus - public transportation - and other less infrastructure and space greedy forms of transportation - like bikes - have to be the priority.  New roads, or new lanes may reduce congestion for a time but it doesn't take long for the gridlock to come back.\n2. And more important - the province has NO BUSINESS - interfering in the traffic planning of municipalities.  For the most part, I have been pleasantly surprised by Doug Fords leadership -- but his vendetta against Toronto demeans him greatly - and will certainly influence how I vote in the next election.\n"

The ability of a biker to travel throughout their city is a positive for every citizen has its saves resources, makes the city more accessible, reduces the use of cars (often only one person in a car), cyclists are citizens. Cyclists are getting exercise that makes them healthier and is less of a burden on the healthcare system. Cyclist can access businesses and merchants easily because they don\u2019t require the use of a parking space. I am really tired of car use in a modern world where all cities are moving towards accessibility. No one\u2018s talking about taking up sidewalks and limiting pedestrians.\n"

They are the ones that have undertaken all the studies and have all the local knowledge and urban planning to know what the local needs are.\nThe job of the government is to facilitate movement of their citizens (especially in the goal of economic activity). Bicycle lanes along major corridors speeds up all traffic once a effective network is in place: especially where there are no good alternative routes such as the ones that appear to be targeted by this legislation: which is also confusing as it appears the real delays are from construction activities, not the removal of car lanes. And this is coming from someone who lives in a rural riding that regularly votes Conservative (and regularly do myself).\n"
