        "comment": "As a car owner and driver for over 30 years, and an avid road cyclist who uses our public infrastructure to ride across the GTA, I am opposed to this Bill 212 as conceived. The issue at stake is not one of \"saving time,\" but of the right to movement in safety, and safe passage, for people who choose to get around on bikes.\nAs a driver, I do not feel attacked or inconvenienced by protected bike lanes. On roads without dedicated lanes, I *always* move over if I see someone on a bike in a lane of traffic. Why? Because sometimes, I am a driver; at other times, I am that cyclist on the street. I would like everyone to be able to get on a bike and arrive safely, and alive, at their destination.\nCities are constantly growing, and we need more patience, not road rage, on the streets. Cycling is a legitimate mode of transportation, but one that is at a disadvantage when sharing unprotected space with motor vehicles. Please think of the lives of cyclists using our roads, some of which may even be your friends, family, and yes, even political supporters of the Conservative party. This bill is not an example of good governance.\n"

More than that, it is abnormal that the Provincial Government wants to dictate how municipalities should plan its traffic grid for local roads within its borders.\n"

        "comment": "It\u2019s not bike lanes that is causing congestions. It\u2019s cars. There are so many undisciplined drivers that even during the morning or afternoon rush, most curbside lanes have illegally parked cars on them. And because of that, I am forced to mix with grumpy and impatient drivers. Please don\u2019t take the bike lanes away. We want to go to the same places all the drivers want to go to. Business have reported to have done better because people who on bikes have better access to business. It\u2019s safer for people to cross the street. Anti bike lanes people say that it makes it harder for disabled people to access businesses, imagine how they are going to cross a multi lane street.\n"

        "comment": "The idea of removing bike lanes from streets in the biggest city in Canada makes 0 sense. No other major city is doing this. There is no data whatsoever backing up the removal of bike lanes to improve traffic.\nIf the issue is indeed that emergency vehicles are stuck in traffic then more and wider bike lanes should be built instead. Emergency vehicles can easily use the bike infrastructure to move through traffic. Bicycles, scooters etc can easily get out of the way should emergency vehicles need to use the lanes. Cars cannot, and replacing a bike lane with another traffic lane will only propagate the issue as cars will fill the new lane and emergency vehicles will continue to remain stuck in traffic.\nStop this nonsense that literally no one asked for.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal runs contrary to all best practices in modern urban design, ignoring 40 years worth of research and international experience.\nNot only is it not going to improve traffic, it's going to increase traffic fatalities. It's also going to waste a huge amount of money doing it, as car traffic lanes are vastly more expensive to build and maintain than bike lanes.\nThe only thing that meaningfully reduces traffic in an urban setting is viable alternatives to driving. This proposal works at counter purposes to its own goals.\n"

        "comment": "This is an absolutely ridiculous bill. It in no way uses best evidence as guidance. In fact, it contradicts best evidence. Transportation is all induced demand. You build more roads or have more lanes and it doesn\u2019t reduce traffic. It gets more people driving. Just like if we had more bike lanes, especially safe ones, we\u2019d have more people cycling. Fewer and fewer people can even afford gas and cars. You\u2019re making it so that travelling anywhere quickly is going to be elitist. That is absurd.\nThen there\u2019s the part in there that lets you ignore environmental protections. That is not okay. This bill is total trash.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are the purview of the city. There is no reason for the province to step in and add unnecessary red tape for a city to progress. This is a very regressive bill. It is also based on a misconception that more car lanes eases congestion in the lomg term. It may do so in the short term, but induced demand causes a street to eventually get just as bad as it was with one fewer lane.\nThe cycling infrastructure that has been added to Toronto in the last few years has been a boon to the neighborhood. Cycling beats any other method for getting around downtown Toronto. Putting a hamper on this progress, simply for the sake of people who don't even live there, but need to commute from out of town, is an egregious dismissal of the people who actually live here.\nIt also encourages more people to get into cars and off their bikes. This is ultimately harmful to the city. It causes more destruction to roads, costing more in maintenance, it increases our hospital bills, and it pollutes our air. This is a regressive step in almost every way.\nAlso, why is this being placed in the same bill as one that allows the proposed highway to bypass the Environmental Assessment Act? These are two completely separate issues and should be placed in separate bills.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 contains an interesting juxtaposition: it expedites the process for building highways just as it adds a lengthy and subjective approval process for bike lane construction.\nThough the bill's content belies its title - it has been long known and repeatedly proven that building and expanding highways does not reduce gridlock; rather, it induces further gridlock - this is somehow not its largest failing. Rather, the bill's fundamentally undemocratic nature is its most appalling quality. It is truly about expanding the provincial government's power to expropriate and trespass onto its constituents, as well as its ability to wantonly overrule municipal by-law as it so desires.\nThe criteria set out in the bill for expropriation and site inspection are immensely vague. Importantly, it requires absolutely no burden of proof in determining that an expropriation, modification to utilities, or site inspection be related to the Highway 413 project - it simply requires that it be deemed related to the project by the Minister.\nFurthermore, at no point does it specify that the provincial government should take into account any factor related to utility infrastructure other than its hindrance to the Highway 413 project, nor does it provide any recourse for the utility or the persons affected by such a modification in the case that the Minister's request be unrealistic, poorly considered, or otherwise fallacious, other than by appeal to that same Minister.\nA common thread in this bill is the selective exemption of municipal by-law towards its stated goals. Once again, the criteria provided here are vague, effectively allowing the Minister to decree that such an exemption is related to the concerned project as it wishes. In all cases, the law being exempted exists at the municipal level for very good reasons; the bill is unjustified in (and does not claim to justify) overriding it. By-laws that may well exist for the safety and well-being of the municipality's constituents can be reversed essentially by decree. That's not very democratic, is it?\nWere such measures to be enacted in response to a situation causing a direct threat to life, well-being, or even economic stability, they might be justified, but the reality is that the bill incentivizes building infrastructure that kills Ontarians while impeding or at least slowing down the deployment of infrastructure that saves lives. Car crashes are by far the leading cause of death for non-elderly Ontarians; the choices made in this bill will help ensure that it remains as such for the foreseeable future. If this bill were truly about reducing gridlock and saving time, its content would be almost the perfect opposite: it would expedite the process for building transportation alternatives that increase modal shift, effectively reducing gridlock by providing road users a viable, even attractive, transportation alternative to a single-occupancy vehicle.\nIn summary, though the bill is short-sighted and misaligned with the outcome it claims to support, the real reason to definitively remove it from any consideration is its undemocratic nature and brazen disregard for the fundamental rights of Ontario's municipalities and constituents.\n"

        "comment": "everyone's all distracted and shitting their pants about bike lanes, that's not the goal of this bill\nThe Schedule enacts the Highway 413 Act, 2024. Section 2 of the Act provides an exemption from the Environmental Assessment Act for enterprises, activities, proposals, plans and programs for or related to Highway 413, including the Highway 413 Project and the Highway 413 early works projects.\nthis allows for completely ignore EAA related regulations and requirements so this government can push through the 413 build as quickly and cheaply as possible.\nThis will undoubtedly cause great harm to species and ecosystems, something this government has previously shown no care for previously, so perhaps this is unsurprising. Regardless, it is reckless and unsustainable.\n"

Putting the bike network on side streets won't work well because 1) destinations are not on the side streets and 2) the side streets can't form a direct network between places because they only go a short distance before hitting a dead-end and requiring you to switch to a new side street. Spending money to remove existing bike lanes is an incredibly bad idea.\n"
