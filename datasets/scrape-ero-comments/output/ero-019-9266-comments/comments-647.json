        "comment": "I ask you to PLEASE reconsider this bill.\nRoad congestion is caused by too many cars on the road, not by too many bikes. The bill will discourage even more people from using alternative transportation for short trips and will ultimately increase congestion via induced demand.\nProtected bike lanes are an important tool to make cycling safer and more accessible.  The bill will lead to more fatal accidents on our roads.\nThe bill undermines the autonomy of municipalities to find the best local solution. It is a politically motivated culture war directed at bike riders and has little to do with finding the best local solution for enabling better mobility by car AND bike. This bill is opposed by the Association of Municipalities of Ontario.\nThere is no way I would have considered riding my bike along Bloor street in Toronto for example prior to having a dedicated bike lane. These lanes save lives, and reduce congestion in our cities.\nThe bill would be a MAJOR step backwards and cause more issues.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes to reduce traffic does not work, period. Improving public transit services and infrastructure is by far a better way to reduce traffic. More cars cause more traffic, plain and simple. Blaming bike lanes for traffic is just an illogical as blaming sidewalks for traffic.\nHospitals were consulted and approved the bike lanes on University Avenue. Many hospital workers use bike lanes to get to work as there isn\u2019t enough space for everyone to drive to the hospitals. Removing the University Ave bike lanes puts our hospital workers in danger.\nThe PC government of Ontario should focus on more pressing issues such as improving our public health system or providing affordable housing, not meddling with municipal infrastructure. Shame on this government. Leave our bike lanes alone.\n"

By collaborating, we can find better solutions and move forward collectively.\n"

        "comment": "I used to battle the bumper-to-bumper traffic on Bloor Street every morning, frustrated as cyclists whizzed by in the dedicated bike lanes. Tired of the gridlock, I switched to taking the subway and cycling through the Bloor and Yonge bike lanes. Now, my commute is faster, healthier, and far less stressful.\nProposing to remove these vital bike lanes to alleviate car congestion overlooks key evidence. Studies show that adding more car lanes doesn't reduce traffic; it often leads to the same congestion levels due to increased car use\u2014a phenomenon known as induced demand. Conversely, cities that expand bike infrastructure see a rise in cycling and a decrease in overall traffic.\nBy keeping the Bloor and Yonge bike lanes, we're promoting efficient, eco-friendly transportation that benefits everyone. Let's continue to move forward by supporting infrastructure that gets us moving, not stuck in traffic.\n"

Taking them away wouldn't save any time on the major roads and would only invite more cars onto the city's roads. Trucks during rush hour are the real issue, truck drivers are also more accident prone and don't follow rules and block cars and traffic anyway.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing in strenuous objection to the proposal that would require provincial approval for the creation of certain bike lanes and permit the removal of existing bike lanes in Toronto. Such actions would constitute an expensive and reckless step backwards.\nSince COVID, Toronto has expanded its network of bike lanes considerably and this has made biking so much safer for me and my nine year old daughter. As a result of our enhanced safety, we now regularly bike almost everywhere we need to go, and in so doing we don't use our car, which has benefits in terms of both pollution and congestion. If the bike lanes were removed, we would be forced to use our car far more often, especially since the roads have only become less safe in recent years due to how many Uber/Lyft/etc. cars are on the road engaging in highly unpredictable and dangerous maneuvers.\nI have no doubt that the only significant outcome of removing existing bike lanes, and increasing the requirements for the creation of new ones, will be an steep increase in the number of injuries and fatalities suffered by cyclists.\n"

        "comment": "Blaming congestion on bike lanes has no evidence or factual backing. Bike lanes provide a safe alternative to car transportation. If Torontonians do not feel safe to bike, they are more likely to take a car or ride share service leading to MORE cars on the roads, and contributing to congestion.\nCar centric infrastructure in a large city is inefficient. The province should prioritize funding and expediting any of the public transit projects that are unfinished, funding the TTC to do vital repairs to reduce slow zones, and leave the capable, democratically elected municipal government to make decisions about our city. Public transport and safe alternative transport infrastructure is the way to reduce congestion, this is supported by evidence. Spending tax payer money on removing existing bike lanes and vetting new ones is not only unnecessary but negligent, ignorant, and actively harmful to vulnerable road users such as cyclisists. Use that money to support public transport projects.\n"

I'm an avid cyclist and use my bike to get around all over this city.\nThe removal of bike lanes along some of the city's busiest road arteries is downright dangerous. It would not only make traffic worse and more chaotic by forcing cyclists into the roads to navigate amongst vehicles, it make commuting by bike far more dangerous. Not to mention it might end up adding MORE cars to roads because people won't feel safe to cycle.\nBill 212 is backwards thinking for a city that desperately needs clean progress on transportation, the environment and quality of living.\nIf this government is actually serious about keeping Torontonians safe, please don't let this bill go through.\nA very concerned citizen,\nJackie V\n"

It presents as a way of getting more bike lanes in ontario cities but then also explicitly approves the expensive and PERSONAL proposal to remove the bloor west bike lane. I don't know a single person in toronto who thinks this is a good idea. The only reason the bloor west bike lane is being taken out is because it affects Doug Fords commute.

With this one decision you are demanding the whole province do something more unsafe because\u2026 you like cars? Have you read research about roads and congestion?!

It\u2019s good for people\u2019s health, it\u2019s good for businesses, and keeping bike lanes helps against car traffic because it allows other effective modes of transportation. If you take away bike lanes this will mean more deaths of cyclists. If you really want to help against traffic you should try investing more in other modes of transportation, like public transit and active transportation, so people will leave their cars at home and get to work and school in a different way. I am always going to keep biking, no matter how little my provincial government thinks of me and my life and my ability to get to work safely. Shame on you for proposing this.\n"

There will no improvement in car congestion on the streets in question.  None.\nBrave cyclists will still ride these streets as they did before the bike lanes were installed.  So instead of being out of the car lane they will be in the reclaimed car lane.  No improvement in congestion.

The people of Toronto elect their officials specifically because of their policies on things such as bike lanes - to have the provincial government come in and do whatever they want goes against the will of the people.\nSecondly, this is a complete waste of taxpayer money. Spending millions of dollars to rip out existing infrastructure while our hospitals are underfunded is unconscionable. To double-back on our research and spending like this is quite literally the opposite of progress.\nThis bill won't even help with gridlock! The only way to effectively fight that is to get people out of cars and into other modes of transport, such as public transportation or - get this - bike lanes!\nThere's no way I can support something that's going to make our streets less safe for everyone. What happened to vision zero? If this bill goes through, people are going to die as a direct result.\n"
