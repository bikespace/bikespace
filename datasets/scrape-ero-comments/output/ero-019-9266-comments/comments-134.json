        "comment": "As a resident of downtown Toronto who lives on Bloor street I was very happy to see the installation of bike lanes along that route. I think it provides a safer option for cyclists and this compelled me to begin using a bicycle as my primary mode of transport. Now, I am a car owner but only use my car when leaving the city\u2026 within Toronto I favour cycling and transit. These are the solutions to congestion: removing vehicles from roads by presenting commuters with more convenient and compelling options to leave their cars at home. There is ample research on the subject of Induced demand, proving essentially that more roads attract more cars, and does the opposite for relieving congestion. I am strongly against any and all bills that sacrifice cycling and transit infrastructure in favour vehicle infrastructure. This is a poor choice for our city and makes it less livable for residents like myself.\n"

Studies after studies have shown that bike lanes are not the main factor in contributing to gridlocks.  Instead, they help to create a vibrant and healthy city.  I live in the downtown core, own a car but will exclusive bike within the city.  I use the bike lanes to safely take my kids to school/daycare, to swimming lessons and to visit parks throughout the city.  Without the safety of bike lanes, I will be forced back into my car, thus adding to the gridlock and pollution.  Why is the government of Ontario sticking their noses into what are municiple issues?  If we really want to deal with gridlock in a mature way, let's talk about increasing funding for transit, getting rid of onstreet parking, and do a better job of enforcing rules of the roads so that people are not blocking the intersections.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are important to every city.\nWe are spending too much time being creative when all we have to do is look to other cities like New York and Montreal who have had successful bike lane projects for years.  Similar climate to ours, as well.\nAnd to those who say bike lanes should not be on major streets, then maybe we shouldn\u2019t have homes and businesses and offices on major streets.  Bike lanes are recession major streets because that is the destination of people.  For the exact same reason cars are on those streets.\nBike lanes are barely necessary on side streets because they are just that;  side streets with fewer cars and therefore bikes don\u2019t need as much protection.\nTo those who say bike lanes don\u2019t get used\u2026well, they certainly don\u2019t get used if they aren\u2019t built.  We are about to reach the breaking point wherein, like nyc, torontonians will be looking for alternatives to cars and even public transit.  If the bike lanes don\u2019t exist, that\u2019s not an option to help get cars off the road and relieve gridlock.  Again, proven to be effective in other cities.  We need to introduce citizens to bike lanes, and they will get used.\nAnd lastly, please, enough with blaming bikes and bike lanes for creating gridlock.  This has been proven by statistics time and time again to be a falsehood.\nThe removal of existing bike lanes is beyond shortsighted.  We paid to create them and now we\u2019re paying to destroy them.  And maybe we\u2019ll\nPay to rebuild them again on a side street where we really don\u2019t need them.\nFord government!  Put money into the well-being of our city, which includes cycling and public transit infrastructure, not into the building of suburbs on vital farmland and green spaces.  We are revolted at the profits you are funnelling into the pockets of your developer buddies!  We know you are lying, Doug!\n"

        "comment": "I have serious concerns regarding the proposed restrictions on , and removal of bike lanes. This is not only a misuse of resources, but is also unlikely to yield meaningful improvements in traffic flow. Research has consistently shown that bike lanes enhance safety and encourage cycling, ultimately reducing congestion by decreasing the number of cars on the road. For instance, a study published in Transportation Research found that cities with extensive bike lane networks experienced measurable reductions in vehicular traffic as more people opted for cycling. Additionally, a report from the National Association of City Transportation Officials (NACTO) indicated that well-designed bike lanes can lead to a 40% increase in cycling and contribute to overall traffic calming.\nMoreover, this bill represents an overreach of provincial power into municipal affairs. Local governments are best positioned to understand the specific needs and dynamics of their communities. By imposing restrictions on bike lane development, the province undermines the ability of municipalities to make informed decisions that promote sustainable transportation and enhance urban mobility. Instead of redirecting funds towards unnecessary adjustments, the focus should be on investing in safe and accessible cycling infrastructure that supports local needs and priorities.\n"

Induced demand ALWAYS create more traffic as the initial capacity from one more lane INVITES more cars, which is the source of traffic. Removing bike lanes endangers those who continue to use a bicycle by forcing them into car lanes or make them choose a car because it is now less safe to ride a bicycle. Car lanes also don't help businesses in the area. Again this is proven locally! Please update your \"common sense.\" And please tell me how ripping up freshly installed lanes as being financially prudent. This government cannot claim to be financially prudent when it proposes to remove infrastructure that has only been just installed. This government cannot claim to be for the environment by promoting car use in dense metro areas. This government cannot claim to be for public health by putting people in danger of more smog, particulates, injury and death from car use. This government cannot claim to be for science when it clearly disregards science for old fashioned hunches and \"common sense.\"\n"

        "comment": "This is a terrible idea. I have recently committed to \"stop making excuses\" about riding my bike because I realised that I was part of the problem. The problem is that each car only has one person in it. This is because mass transportation methods are less convenient than driving. Adding lanes to roadways will only encourage more people to occupy roadways in private vehicles with a single occupant (induced demand, an effect that is widely understood and proven in practice, and runs completely counter to the government's plans).\nMy bike commute takes less than 52 min. Public transport from the same starting point is 53 min at best, but of course subject to many of the same delays as a private car.\nThe solution, to satisfy the government's economic objectives, is to reduce the number of private vehicles, especially those with a single occupant, leaving more space for transport trucks. The method of reducing private vehicles is to invest in public transit so that it becomes a competitive option to the private traveler.\nThe government's plan takes a short-term view. The pursuit of relatively immediate economic goals comes at the cost of the environment. The government is choosing to pass on the problems we create now to our children and grandchildren. It is morally bankrupt to commit our future generations to solve a problem that we have knowingly created.\n"

As a result, I've made the decision to leave and will never look back. This provincial government is directly accountable for every single argument in favour of leaving and has been actively growing an endless list of nonsensical, objectively poor decisions - there is clearly no fear or even basic respect for Ontarians, their rights, or their interests.\nRegarding this specific bill - firstly, it is an absurd overreach of provincial power. Why is the province wasting its time and resources micro managing municipalities?\nSecond, ripping out pre-existing bike lanes is a complete waste of money.\nIs the intention to reduce gridlock? Reduce the number of people in cars. Thats it. That is literally the only way to address the problem. There is endless data objectively demonstrating this. You will not solve gridlock with new lanes, or by pissing away billions of dollars on a tunnel. There is no data to support your actions, it simply doesn't exist\nYou need to\na) Divert people away from high density areas. People should not be going THROUGH Toronto unless their destination is in Toronto\nb) Providing effective alternative transport methods such as robust public transit and avenues for active transport (LIKE BIKE LANES), so people have options other than driving\nc) Change zoning laws to allow for more mixed use neighbourhoods so more people can live close to where they work so they dont have to commute, or at the very least, live close to shops and services so they can access the majority of what they need either without a car, or with a very short drive.\nBlatantly ignoring evidence based solutions because the Premier has decided he has a beef with bike lanes for some reason will make gridlock worse, not better, and your time and tax payer money would be better spent addressing issues like Healthcare and Education (you know, *provincial responsibilities*) instead of micromanaging municipal affairs.\nIf the Premier wants to be mayor of Toronto so badly, he should resign and run in the next election, and leave being Premier to someone who knows what they are doing. He's already gerrymandered the ridings. But I suppose taking a C-suite job at Chartwell is a much easier retirement plan given all of the favours he will be owed from the rampant and insulting obvious levels of corruption brought on by your office.\nShame on every single one of you for selling this province out from underneath it's citizens. We had the opportunity and potential to be somewhere proud to live and have completely squandered it to the benefit of an extremely small number of people. Young people are waking up and beginning to flee droves, and you only have yourselves to blame.\n"

These leftists are using bikers as pawns in their anti-car rhetoric, like human traffic calming, and it will only cause more deaths and accidents.\nI fully support putting bike lanes on side streets and quieter streets downtown and being more creative with solutions to have bike lanes that are better planned and thought out rather than \"cars bad, bikes good\".\nThe city should be available to everyone and smartly designed to accommodate all transportation methods.

The bike lanes make getting around the city extremely difficult and are mostly used by unlicensed electric vehicles which seem to make them unsafe for some bicyclers.

        "comment": "This bill is exactly the wrong direction if the province's goal is to reduce gridlock. Every study on traffic has shown that more lanes may temporarily reduce congestion, but new trips not previously taken will quickly fill available capacity. The only long term solution to congestion is switching the mode of trips away from low capacity ones like single occupancy vehicles to high capacity ones like active transportation by bike or walking or public transit.\nCar lanes optimistically carry about 1000 vehicles per hour. Protected bike lanes carry 7500 people per hour. Each bicycle also represents a car that isn't on the road, freeing up more capacity in the car lane. Bus lanes can also support about 8000 people per hour. Rail can move tens of thousands of people per hour. Why are we spending time and money on the least efficient, most dangerous way to move people through our cities? Cars, especially single occupancy vehicles, should be the mode of last resort in our dense urban spaces, not the mode enshrined by this terrible bill.\nVehicle road space needs to be reserved for necessary uses, like large commercial deliveries, trades that need to bring complex tools to a job site, and emergency and other city services. Personal transportation needs to move away from the car.\n\"Prescribed municipalities would be required to seek provincial approval to allow for the implementation of new bicycle lanes\"\nWhat a waste of time and resources. The province needs to leave cities alone to work out the best solution to move their residents around their urban space. If the Premier and Minister of Transport want to manage city streets they should run for mayor or city council. Leave the cities alone.\n\"exemption from the Environmental Assessment Act\"\nHighway 413 or any other highway building project needs to undergo all relevant environmental assessment. This is a cowardly way to ignore the fact that highway 413 will not meet environmental requirements.\n"
