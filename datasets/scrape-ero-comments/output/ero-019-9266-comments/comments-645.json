        "comment": "I am a driver who lives and has lived  in the Bloor-Ossington area of downtown Toronto for 40 years. Traffic congestion is a problem, and has been a problem long before bike lanes were put in. Moving people by bicycle is a better solution than removing bike lanes for many reasons. We should be extending bike lanes, making bicycle commuting safer and more attractive. With all the high rise residential construction going on in my neighbourhood, we can expect thousands, perhaps tens of thousands of new residents clogging our roadways. I want them on bicycles, not in cars!\nIt is lunacy to make bicycle commuting a less attractive alternative to cars. It needs to be the preferred transportation method. Everything we do should encourage bicycles over cars, not discourage it!\n"

I live in Toronto and work downtown. Bike lanes make navigating this city so much easier. They are well used, they are safe and they are a healthy, environmentally friendly alternative to driving. The traffic congestion from automobiles in this city is terrible. Bike lanes help to alleviate this - not make it worse. Removing bikes lanes is a misguided decision and a bad policy. Please re-think it, and make a different, better choice.\n"

The intent is in the right place to install bike lanes but vehicle traffic needs to take precedence over bikes. Trying to make our city bike friendly is a great idea in theory but in practise does not work in our city. This is not europe. Bike lanes in the suburb is an absolute waste of money and resources. All the bike lanes in my neighborhood are empty more than 75% of the time. Our city is too sprawling for this type of venture. I understand that the govt is trying to get people out of there vehicles but the reality is that Toronto will always be dominated by car traffic\n"

        "comment": "I am horrified that the province of Ontario is intending to require bike lanes from Toronto's streets be removed leaving Toronto to pay the 75 million dollars to remove them over and above the 47 million it cost to install them.\nBike lanes move people better.  There is a 600% increase in bike use in some of the lanes slated for removal!  And bicycling is a CO2 free activity meaning there is no climate change activity from bicyclists unlike cars.\nThe safety of bicyclists in the bike lanes saves lives.  The increase in bicyclist deaths is preventable with the safety bike lanes offer.  Removing the lanes also potentially adds more cars to the road increasing traffic issues.\n"

        "comment": "The proposed legislation to remove bike lanes from Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue is misguided and unlikely to address the root causes of gridlock. The physical space required to accommodate all commuters in motor vehicles in Toronto\u2019s dense urban core is far beyond what is feasible. Bike lanes are not the cause of congestion\u2014they are a solution to the larger issue of overreliance on cars in areas where space is limited. Prioritizing long-range car commuters over local residents undermines the safety, health, and quality of life for those who live and work in these neighbourhoods.\nLocal residents must come first to determine urban infrastructure. In the inner neighbourhoods of Toronto, local residents are most affected by the noise, pollution, and safety risks associated with increased car traffic. Removing bike lanes to allow for more cars only exacerbates these issues. Moreover, local businesses, which are vital to Toronto\u2019s economy, depend far more on foot, transit, and bike traffic than on car traffic. Expanding cycling infrastructure, rather than reducing it, is the better way to support these businesses and create vibrant, livable neighbourhoods.\nThe province should respect municipal autonomy and allow Toronto\u2019s elected mayor and council to make decisions that reflect the needs and priorities of the city\u2019s residents. The local population density in Toronto\u2019s inner neighbourhoods far outweighs the number of potential car commuters. These residents should not be forced to sacrifice the safety, livability, and character of their neighbourhoods to accommodate a minority of long-range drivers, while most commuters and visitors already rely on transit, not cars.\nInstead of removing bike lanes, the province should focus on supporting modes of transportation that are most feasible and beneficial for local residents. While this may mean cars in smaller cities and rural areas, in Toronto\u2019s dense core, the most effective and equitable solutions lie in sustainable options like cycling, walking, and public transit\u2014not an increased reliance on cars. Supporting these modes is critical to ensuring Toronto remains a safe, vibrant, and livable city for its residents.\n"

        "comment": "It is very well documented how the USA has destroyed its cities since the 50s by re-tailoring them for cars instead of people.\nAnd their arguments have been precisely the same this proposal is using, namely disguised under the dogma of time and money savings.\nIt is ironic this proposal talks about saving money when its goal is to dismantle bike lanes that have been completed less  than a year ago. That would really be a waste of money!\nI, for one, don't want to make Toronto another usanian city without character and with total disregard to its citizens.\nWhy don't you look instead to smarter examples than the northametican ones? Why are we here so afraid of adopting solutions made in Europe? Why can't we invest in more, and more efficient, public transportation?\nPlease, stop this usanian bigotry. Learn about how things work in cities like Madrid, Barcelona, Paris or London. Get educated and informed, before deciding to waste our money and our city.\nThanks.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to strongly oppose Bill 212. Bike lanes should be a municipal decision, built according to the needs and desires of the municipality in which bike lanes serve as important transportation infrastructure.\nThe basis of this proposal - that the removal of bike lanes will alleviate traffic - has no scientific, practical, or financial basis.\nBike lanes are life-saving infrastructure that allow for a city's inhabitants to more easily opt out of driving. Studies of bike lanes in Toronto show that bike lanes increased cyclist volume by over 2.5x, which translates to a real reduction in the number of cars on the road. The use of Bike Share in Toronto has increased many times over - amounting to almost 6 million rides taken in 2023 alone.\nMoreover, many of Toronto's worst traffic problem spots, such as Lakeshore and Jarvis, are in no way related to the presence of bike lanes.\nBike lanes create induced demand, which means that over time, more people will choose to bike over take their car. They are future-oriented infrastructure - not only for the fundamental fact that they prevent fatalities, but for the economic and environmental wellbeing of cities. Bike lanes are scientifically proven to reduce cyclist fatalities and reduce emissions. There is no supporting scientific evidence that the addition of car lanes reduces traffic; in fact, the opposite is more often the case.\nShould the provincial government remove bike lanes, many cyclists will be forced to use car lanes to navigate the city, which will increase confusion and create gridlock and frustration among car users. Removing bike lanes will not remove cyclists. They will simply remove SAFE cycling, forcing bikes onto the road with motor vehicles.\nThe provincial government should not spend taxpayer money on undoing municipal infrastructure projects and should instead focus on developing non-car-related methods for alleviating traffic in the city. Keeping bike lanes and focusing on building up non-car related infrastructure perfectly aligns with  the province of Ontario's own website, which states that one of the main ways to fight climate change is to: \"Choose cleaner travel choices, such as public transit or bicycle.\"\n"

It has been supported by science and existing data that improving biking infrastructure and transit opportunities reduces gridlock.\nI am against the schedules in this proposed act that remove environmental assessments to expedite construction of the unnecessary 413 highway and Bradford Bypass. I am also concerned about the transparency around this part of the bill, as it was not noted in the overview provided on the comment page that the Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act was a vehicle to enact several other unpopular Acts. Environmental assessments are a necessary process that ensures the province is doing its due diligence with regards to its responsibilities to uphold environmental integrity.\nI am extremely disappointed with the government's stance on pushing through the construction on hwy 413 despite studies showing it will not save Ontarians time and will lead to significant impacts on species at risk.\nNone of the proposed measures in this bill will reduce gridlock or save me time. Please do not pass it.\n"

If you want to expand roads, you need to prioritize these other modes of transportation too - because let's face it, more cars on the road won't help people get around quicker.\nPlease continue prioritizing bike routes. Looks to cities like Calgary, that do an extremely good job of having a cycle network (and park network) integrated seamlessly throughout the city. For a city of our size, we are hugely lacking in support for cycling. Don't make it worse. Make a legacy you can be proud of that will empower the generations to come!\n"

The problem is single occupancy vehicles, not bike lanes.\n4. Make PUBLIC TRANSIT AND CYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE BETTER. Literally every major European city discourages (or bans!) cars from entering the downtown core. Cars are the problem.\n5.

        "comment": "To the Government of Ontario, Premier Doug Ford, and Minister Sarkaria,\nI am writing to express my profound disapproval of the proposed legislation mandating the removal of key bike lanes in Toronto, along with new regulatory powers over municipal cycling infrastructure decisions. This proposal not only undermines local governance but also disrespects the will of Toronto\u2019s residents and taxpayers.\n1. Municipal Autonomy and Provincial Overreach\nThis proposal represents a blatant overreach by the provincial government into matters that fall within the jurisdiction of municipalities. Cycling infrastructure decisions, including the placement and maintenance of bike lanes, should remain the responsibility of Toronto\u2019s local government, who are best equipped to respond to the specific needs and priorities of their community. The proposal to impose provincial review and approval processes strips Toronto of its authority, undermining the very principles of municipal self-governance.\n2. Disregard for Toronto's Electorate and Taxpayers\nToronto residents have already expressed their support for bike lanes through their elected representatives, reflecting a strong democratic mandate. Taxpayers have willingly funded these projects as part of Toronto\u2019s vision for a safer, greener, and more accessible city. For the province to mandate the removal of this infrastructure, taxpayers will now not only lose the benefits of their investment but also be forced to fund this unwanted change\u2014a gross misuse of public funds.\n**3. Wasted Resources and Misallocation of Provincial Taxpayer Money**\nThe broader taxpayer base across Ontario will be footing the bill for road alterations in Toronto that serve no expressed public interest. With Ontario's cities facing real challenges, such as affordable housing, healthcare, and public transit funding, diverting resources to dismantle functioning, community-supported bike lanes is both wasteful and misaligned with provincial priorities.\n4. Compromised Safety for All Road Users\nBike lanes serve as a critical measure to improve road safety for cyclists, pedestrians, and motorists alike. Removing these lanes will force cyclists back into vehicle lanes, creating greater risk and conflict on busy streets. This legislation disregards the safety of all road users in favor of an approach that prioritizes vehicular traffic at the cost of alternative, sustainable, and safer modes of transportation.\n5. Worsening of Congestion by Eliminating Transportation Alternatives\nTraffic congestion results directly from overreliance on cars. Removing bike lanes restricts options for safe, alternative transportation, forcing more people to rely on vehicles, thereby worsening congestion. Rather than \u201cfighting gridlock,\u201d this proposal will intensify it by effectively eliminating alternatives that reduce vehicular pressure on Toronto\u2019s roads.\nWhile the provisions requiring provincial approval for new municipal bike lanes and provisions setting out a process for the review of existing infrastructure remain an unwelcome overreach, at the very least, the existing bike infrastructure on Yonge, Bloor, and University should be subject to the same data-driven, evidence-based, criteria-established decision-making process rather than removed by decree without any supporting evidence of the effects of this decision.\nIn summary, this legislation represents an unwelcome and intrusive intervention in the affairs of municipalities across the province of Ontario which sets a terrible precedent for urban planning investments at the municipal level--how can cities go forward and make investments in their infrastructure without being confident that the provincial government will not simply reverse this work and waste the taxpayer's money that they spent? It is also an unwelcome and intrusive intervention in Toronto\u2019s urban planning, a waste of taxpayer resources, and a move toward less safe, less sustainable, and more congested streets.\nI strongly urge the Ontario government to respect municipal autonomy, taxpayer investment, and the expressed will of Toronto\u2019s residents by abandoning this proposed legislation.\n"
