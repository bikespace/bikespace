        "comment": "I am amazed that the Ministry of Transportation can support the idea that congestion in an arterial road can be solved with the removal of bike lanes without any consideration for operations at intersections.  In arterial roads the level of service is fully dependent on the number and separation of intersections along a corridor and not in the number of vehicular lanes. It is disappointing that a political opinion is becoming more valuable that a professional opinion. Without any support that demonstrates the benefits of Mr. Ford decision this is just a political vendetta.\n"

        "comment": "After being nervous about biking in the city of Toronto for many years, the combination of gas prices, climate change, gridlock, and the need to find ways of exercising more frequently to improve my physical and mental health lead me to become a bike commuter. I now ride over 20km a day on average.\nBike lanes have been a huge part of the reason I\u2019ve felt safe most of the time I\u2019m commuting, which as a husband and father is incredibly important to me. I should not have to feel as though I\u2019m risking my life in order to be a part of the solution for gridlock in the city. I am proof that bike lanes reduce traffic because every day myself and other cyclists are able to commute as quickly and efficiently (or more) as the single-driver cars we drive by in traffic, with each bike representing a car that\u2019s not making that traffic worse.\nMy commuting time did not increase when I made the switch from car to bike, which shows how efficiently Toronto\u2019s network of bike lanes is capable of getting residents to and from their place of work safely, and without increasing their commute time.\nThe future we need, which is one of less traffic, cleaner air, and a population with improved physical and mental health (that will help alleviate demand on our health care system) is all possible with the promotion of biking, and the effort to do all that we can to make it safe and accessible for Ontario\u2019s residents.\nRemoving bike lanes will absolutely cause even more cyclist deaths than we\u2019re already grappling with. I don\u2019t want my son to grow up without a father, or lose friends or neighbours to cycling fatalities, but by regressing our progress, as is being proposed with this bill, I fear it is a statistical guarantee this will happen.\nFurthermore, the reduction in safe options for bikers to reach their destination will result in them making the decision to drive more often, which will further increase traffic and pollution in the city, and further increase the chances of a vehicle and bike collision.\nThis is so obvious that it concerns me that this Bill is being proposed regardless, and genuinely makes me wonder if this government values the lives, freedom,\n and safety of it\u2019s residents over creating a narrative that will help convince the mis-informed to give it their vote.\nLastly, this is a tremendous waste of resources and tax payer money. There are so many more infrastructure projects that could benefit from the time and money being wasted on this regressive bill. If your government insists on moving Ontario backwards and risking my life on a daily basis, I would have no other choice than to use whatever resources I have available to ensure you don\u2019t get my vote, or the vote of my friends, family, and community. Please scrap this bill.\n"

Bike lanes are good for local businesses, good for the environment, safer for pedestrians and cyclists. If the goal is reducing gridlock, the province could instead focus on improving / incentivizing transit so people don\u2019t need to drive for thier commutes and incentivizing e-bike/ e-scooter use (like other provinces).\n"

The bike lines are the best thing that has happened to this stretch of road in 10 years. It seems to me sheer idiocy to believe that taking away lanes for travellers with minimal area 'footprint' can somehow reduce congestion.\n"

There\u2019s places in the world where bike lanes are so far advanced that people simply perform all life activities on a bike. This act will take our city back decades. If we don\u2019t do it now, we will be spending millions in the future to build it.\nBikes make people healthier, saving much needed spaces in our healthcare systems. Bikes help reduce greenhouse gasses, and help us get to our climate objectives.\nThis is truly truly step, because we will absolutely have to build it out later. We are just delaying the inevitable and spending taxpayers money unnecessarily.\nI voted conservative all my life, but this is definitely change my vote for next provincial election.\n"

They are certainly handy for me when I do that.\nNevertheless, those lanes have been devastating to traffic on that street, and on surrounding streets. so they need to go.   I'll find another way to bike downtown.\nAs far as I know, the city did not do any planning for how traffic would be rerouted.  Eg. \"X cars per hour will travel along Y street instead of Danforth\".  Instead, they just cut the capacity in half and left it to drivers to figure it out.\n"

        "comment": "This policy will not reduce congestion but will lead to death of local residents. This is grotesque government overreach. Why is an MPP from the Kingston area, or from South Western Ontario making local decisions about Toronto street designs? We have local representatives to make local decisions.\nI live in Toronto. I do not own a car. Why is my and my family's ability to get to work, school, or to go shopping not treated with the same priority as someone who does not live in my community, does not pay taxes in my community, do not live or shop in my community? Why is someone's ability to not have a minor inconvenience when driving through my community a greater priority then mine?  I actually stop and shop on the main streets. The cars just go by out to the suburbs, let them take the back streets without businesses.\nWe know about induced demand. We know for a fact removal of bike lanes will not increase traffic flow. Toronto had bad traffic in the 70's with a way lower population, but same road width. Has this government completely given up on any climate goals even when it doesn't cost money, and they don't need to do anything. I bike year round as my primary method of transportation instead of polluting. Why must I risk my life even more to do this, for a policy which will not even improve things for cars. Why are you wasting money on this when healthcare is failing in the province. Education is failing in the province. Housing is failing in the province. Intermodal street designs are succeeding in Toronto and need to be left alone or the blood will be on your hands.\n"

There is no reason to do this other than vindictiveness against cyclists and against the residents of Toronto.\n"

        "comment": "If you remove bike lanes you either force more people to drive, increasing the number of cars on the road and causing congestion, or you force cyclists and drivers into mixed traffic. As bikes are far slower than cars this will slow drivers down significantly. It will also lead to more accidents, which will both distract emergency vehicles from other emergencies and lead to them blocking traffic more frequently on their way to bike-car accidents.\nHaving recently spent several months in a large European city with good cycling infrastructure, one thing that impressed me was just how much more smoothly the car traffic could flow there compared to Canadian cities of the same size. By providing better options you reduce the amount of people who *need* to drive, and so those who genuinely require a motor vehicle benefit.\n"

        "comment": "I kindly request that the government of Ontario not pursue this regulation and remove any and all pursuit of interfering with municipal affairs. As someone that drives a car, bike lanes are not the cause of traffic, cars are the cause of traffic. Adding more cars by removing the option for people to cycle will only increase the number of cars on the roads and cause further gridlock. Bike lanes controbute to safe and productive streets that allow businesses to thrive, while more car lanes are a burden on the budget. I was under the impression that this government is fiscally responsible?\nThere is countless amounts of evidence to support, the city of Toronto has evidence to support this, smaller Ontario towns have evidence to support this. The best way to reduce traffic is to provide viable alternatives to driving, through bike lanes and public transportation. More car lanes has never worked anywhere in the world to reduce traffic through the phenomenon of induced demand.\nFurthermore, I kindly ask the Progressive Conservative government to stay in their lane and work on provincial affairs, like health care and education. Leave municipal affairs to the municipalities.\nFinally, if this regulation is kept, I will not be voting for the Ontario PC party in the next elections and I will advise evryone I know not to vote due to this clear lack of judgement from the government.\n"

More importantly this bill will put people's safety at risk - including my safety as a cyclist. I already encounter dangerously aggressive drivers whenever I'm on my bike. Not only will I now have to cycle in mixed traffic but the signal you are sending drivers is that I don't belong there at all. This will only embolden already aggressive drivers. Someone will be killed as a result of this bill and it will be their blood on your hands.\nStats already show that bike lanes do not contribute to congestion. After all there are no bike lanes on the Gardner, DVP, 401 and QEW yet they are congested all day long.\nPlease reconsider implementing this bill and instead focus on real solutions to tackling congestion in the region. The experts are out there is you truly want to hear from them.\n"

I\u2019m particularly concerned that bike lanes will be removed from the Danforth and Yonge street.

To take away the bike lanes that are widely used and propose taking away even more is a massive step backwards for this province that is already falling behind the rest of the country in terms of alternative transportation. There is plenty of evidence to support bike lanes reducing traffic while adding vehicle lanes does absolutely nothing to reduce traffic congestion. If anything the bike lanes should be better serviced and prioritized for snow clearing as this would increase their use even further and....guess what... Lessen traffic congestion. If the province moves forward with this bill then this party has lost my vote and that of many others trying to make ends meet in this overpriced province.\n"
