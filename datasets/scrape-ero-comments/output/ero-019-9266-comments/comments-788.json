Removing the bike lanes would be a setback.\nThis petition requests that the current lanes be maintained and their network expanded.\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nI am of the opinion that bike lanes should be the decision of the municipal government as part of their local responsibilities.\nHighway 413 is an unnecessary construction that will significantly damage quality of life for families, communities and local environments in the 905. I think the Province would do better to focus on finishing the numerous Metrolinx projects - including the extension of the subway lines, the twinning of the GO rail lines, new GO stations that have been previously approved for future growth. Much money has been previously spent on these projects and it\u2019s better than wasting time on a highway that isn\u2019t fully planned.\nI also think the Province should investigate some of the proposals regarding the 407 - like buying it back completely or subsidizing the cost of transport vehicles to take them off the 401 and reduce a lot of the congestion. If after the Metrolinx projects are done and existing traffic is offloaded onto the 407, maybe that\u2019s when the 413 should be re-examined. But right now, it will cause further upheaval in the region\u2019s traffic.\nEnvironmental Assessments should not be further pushed aside. Doing the work properly ensures the safety of everyone, limits the damage and liability of so many projects. And ensures a better conservation of the environment of course.\nExpanding broadband internet to rural communities is great, BUT why use an American company? Using a Canadian company will save time, money and ensure we have an in house system that will not be vulnerable to international risks or invasion of privacy from foreign interests.\n"

        "comment": "Ontario needs safe cycling infrastructure. This bill is an attack on our civil liberties as Ontarians. Every person who is on a bike instead of driving, is helping to decrease car traffic. Removing the option of safe cycling will only create more traffic. This Bill would be a climate disaster. Our cities need less noise and air pollution, which means more bikes and less cars. Bill 212 will cause more wear and tear on roads, costing more money to fix roads more frequently. For individual and community health and safety, we need active transportation options. Every single person and facet of society benefits when we allow people the dignity to exist safely and productively outside of a car. People on bikes deserve safety and respect. There is no research to support Bill 212 and it can not continue.\n"

By giving more citizen incentive to drive, more citizen will choose to drive and increase congestion two fold.\nI've cycled in this city for over 25 years as a commuter 8km each way, East West directions. Toronto is relatively flat parallel to the lake, we should take advantage of this geography to help citizen choose alternatives to the automobile.\nIn addition public transit is not reliable enough to be consistent on a weekly basis. I've chosen to commute by bicycle, economical with health benefits.\nI am also an all season cyclist, bicycle right of way lanes have made this possible. Citizens who choose to cycle as a means of transportation will continue to do so.\nRemoving the bicycle lanes will be a mistake. Exactly the same legacy mistake provincial government did selling the 407 ETR by the Mike Harris government. Provincial leadership must not repeat past mistakes and must listen to the experts in this field.\n"

        "comment": "For the past several months, my commute from The Kingsway to an exercise class in Bloor West Village has been taking three to four times as long to get to.\nThe trip, which I have been making several times a week for several years, involves at least four bottlenecks:\n-Southbound on The Kingsway to Bloor St. where the light is long and vehicles turning east often cannot make the light due to congestion from the next light near Old Mill subway station\n-Congestion at the light near Old Mill subway station (Old Mill Trail)\n-Congestion across the bridge, which in a lifetime of living in this neighbourhood I have only ever seen during RIDE programs\n-Congestion approaching Jane Street, through Runnymede\nThe issues are so widespread that the fitness studio, where visitors pay $40/class, has had to post a sign on the door suggesting that anyone later than 10 minutes cannot be permitted entry.\nAs a full-time employed person, whose taxes are up-to-date, please be assured there is no scenario in which I am going to be persuaded of biking to the class. Overlooking the amount of time that would take, the weather would prevent it for most of the year. Further, due to the nature of my job, I cannot leave more time for a commute.\nWhile I understand there is some movement on this file, the issue has the potential to cost me $40-$120 each week. I can only imagine how it is impacting local businesses\u2013many of which have been depressed by Covid measures.\nFinally, the forum at Etobicoke Collegiate Institute made clear that the vocal minority is prone to wishful thinking about the value of \"complete\" streets and \"safety\". Much of their theory does not migrate well to practice. The claims from a fire chief that response times had improved seemed not to take into consideration how quiet streets were because of lockdown measures. I appreciate political theatre as much as anyone, but this problem is having a real and measurable financial impact on local residents.\nLeaving the forum, my 9-year-old niece wondered aloud why some of the bike lane advocates were not worried by how much long-idling cars are polluting the environment. A great point which I do not recall being mentioned at the forum.\nPlease use your power to resolve this issue sooner than later.\n"

I choose to cycle because it reduces grid lock and reduces air pollution, making the city safer and more efficient for all of its residents.\nBike lanes are necessary for cyclists' safety. I have gotten into serious accidents while cycling on streets that do not have bike lanes. Cars are frequently oblivious to cyclists and do not attempt to share the lane. The proposed removal of bike lanes along Bloor St., Yonge St., and University Ave will put cyclists in serious danger.\nThe province should be investing in clean and efficient infrastructure that supports a healthier and greener city.

        "comment": "My family strongly opposes Bill 212, which restricts the installation of new bike lanes and gives the Province authority to remove existing ones. It undermines safety, sustainability, and the local autonomy needed to design transportation solutions that work for communities. Frankly, this bill makes me embarrassed to say that I'm from Ontario.\nBike lanes are essential infrastructure. They allow families like mine to travel safely\u2014to school, work, appointments, and local businesses\u2014without relying on cars. For us, this isn\u2019t just about recreation; it\u2019s about having real, safe options. Bike lanes save lives, prevent injuries, and make streets safer for everyone, including people driving.\nClaims that bike lanes cause congestion are unfounded. Motor vehicles are the main cause of traffic congestion, as evidenced by the congestion on roads like Highway 401 and the Don Valley Parkway, which don't even have bike lanes. Bike lanes are incredibly efficient at moving people, and they reduce the number of cars on the road, easing congestion for those who need to drive. Removing bike lanes would only worsen gridlock, not solve it.\nThis bill is also fiscally irresponsible. Removing existing bike lanes wastes taxpayer money already spent on their design, construction, and public consultation. It is significantly more expensive to rip out infrastructure than to leave it in place. Municipalities, which are best positioned to decide where bike lanes are needed, have not budgeted for these unnecessary changes. This is provincial overreach that imposes costs while reducing safety and choice.\nBike lanes contribute to public health by encouraging active transportation, which reduces the risk of chronic disease, improves mental health, and lowers healthcare costs. They also help us meet climate goals by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality. This bill runs counter to these priorities and ignores overwhelming evidence of the benefits of bike lanes.\nWe need more bike lanes, not fewer. This legislation will lead to more injuries and preventable deaths, putting Ontarians at risk. I urge you to abandon this harmful, short-sighted bill and instead support safer, more sustainable streets.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 will make downtown and Toronto worse and less accessible, not to mention it goes against all the efforts to modernize the city and fight climate change.\nUnder the premise of reducing gridlock, the bill is based on incorrect assumptions and ignores all existing data and examples from other cities of all sizes that succeeded in implementing alternatives to cars. Not to mention the lives lost this year for car-focused infrastructure.\nAdditionally, changes regarding environmental assessments on Highway 413 are a treat to our environment. The highway will be built on highly sensitive land and without proper evaluation and planning will cause a great amount of damage to Ontario\u2019s fauna and flora.\nBill 212 is a backwards approach to \u201creducing\u201d gridlock which will have the complete opposite effect: gridlock will become worse as fewer people will bike and more will drive, public safety will be worse, the environment will be senselessly, irreparably destroyed.\n"

        "comment": "As a Torontonian who uses the Bloor and University bike lanes every week to get to work, including in the winter (we have mild winters compared to the rest of the country) I can confidently say that passing this proposal will make my commute, and the commutes of many others who live in the city, significantly more dangerous.\nDecisions about city infrastructure should be based on data. Studies have shown that increasing the number of car lanes does not significantly speed up traffic in the long run due to induced demand. Once a new lane is introduced, more people either switch to using cars who weren't driving before, or drivers divert from their previous route to the newly opened lane. Eventually, congestion returns to the same level as before.\nTo help with traffic, the city needs better public transit. Our public transit system is frequently unreliable and not nearly as expansive as the city requires. We need investment in TTC, not the removal of basic public safety measures that reduce death of Toronto citizens.\n"

        "comment": "Comments on Bill 212 - Reducing Gridlock, Saving Your Time Act, 2024\nI am a senior living in Toronto, I'm a cyclist and worked for 30 years in the provincial government. For most of my 30 years I cycled to work.  As a former civil servant, I fully know the Provincial Government has the power to override local democracy, its done it several times before in the City of Toronto.  Having the power to do something, isn't the same as having the moral authority to do it. Each time the provincial government arbitrarily interferes it make local residents more cynical about government.  If you don't trust municipalities to operate their communities - why don't you just abolish them outright!\nAs a retired person - 66 years old, I still cycle daily of shopping, volunteering and visiting and caring for family and friends.  If Bill 212 is passed and receives Royal Assent it puts me in danger.  I visit a 97 year old friend several times a week who lives in a downtown Long-Term Care Home.  I live in East York (Toronto).  I use bike lanes on Danforth and Bloor to visit my elderly friend with dementia.  I also have POAs for her care.  So your Bill 212 will force the City of Toronto to rip up lanes than help to ensure my safety.  I not a motorist, but how the hell will I cross the Don River without going on a major road.  Does my safety not matter to your government.  It seems not.  This Bill is Dog Whistle politics.  It puts the safety of a minority group - cyclists up for debate.  In order to safe motorists a few minutes my safety is up for grabs.\nI am opposed to this Bill.  It is bad example of overreach on the part of a higher level of government - provincial government that takes away democratic control from municipalities.  I never elected the Premier to run the city of Toronto.  If the Premier is hell bend on running the city, the Premier should run for Mayor of the City of Toronto. Until the Premier does, he should respect local decision making.    Bill 212 is arbitrary and is one sided.  It is aimed at motor vehicle drivers to the detriment of cyclists.  Bike Lanes are best handle by local government. Bike lanes have always been a municipal responsibility.  Good governance calls for the control by that level of government closest to the decision. What do the MPPs in Queen's Park know about traffic flow in the city of Toronto or any other municipality.  As a citizen of Canada, living in Ontario and a resident of Toronto, it makes no sense for the provincial government to interfere with the running of municipalities.\n"

        "comment": "Bloor Street separated Bike tracks lanes will allow more people to use transit as an option that provides efficiency and near door to door flexibility,\nFrom reading the comments about this bill by Premier Ford and his transportation minister it is apparant that their premise is that streets serve to move cars or trucks.  They talk about increasing productivity and efficiency, but only when driving cars.  This narrow view of the use of this public space has resulted in a very inefficient use of this common infrastructure over the years of their tenure and of those before them.\nThe premise should be the purpose of streets are there to move people - whether they are on bikes, in transit vehicles or in cars, and of course cargo, whether it is moved by bike couriers, in trucks or cars. If you want to look at efficiency (moving the most people at the lowest cost it is transit first, bikes second and cars and trucks third.)\nMy own example illustrates the point.  I take the subway when I work downtown, the subway moves me to the St. George station quickly from 30 - 40 mins. However the next leg of the the trip from St. George station to my final destination via bus and walking adds about 20 mins to the trip.  However using a Bike Share bike I travel the separated bike lanes on Bloor and George street take 10 mins off my trip there.  The same is true on my return trip.   I take a bike share bike back up St. George Street and then along Bloor to Yonge Street to catch the subway.  This takes 10 - 12 mins off the trip.  Those lanes make the trip 16% faster.\nI was encouraged to start using  the Bike share bikes this fall as part of a hybrid transit+bike trip because of the newly constructed separated lanes on Bloor. They made the trip markedly safer.   Traveling this way gives the speed and efficiency of high capacity transit with the speed and flexibility near door to door travel provided by the Bike Share bike and the many stations that are the potential end points of my trip.\nPremier Ford your plan to remove them will remove that incentive from me and many other people.  Supporting this Hybrid option of Transit + bike is a way to encourage more people to make the switch from driving single person cars to much more efficient means of transportation, transit and bike.\n"

        "comment": "The decision to remove bike lanes is a short term reaction that will have little effect on traffic delays which are anffected by many other factors including construction and significant negative implications for quality of life in Toronto.   I live in the one of the areas where bike lanes may be removed (Bloor and Avenue Road); they are heavily used by students at UofT, delivery services, local residents and tourists and represent a massive improvement to the streetscape.\nInvestment in public transit and more bike lanes at least in the downtown core (not less) will incentivize fewer cars, lower pollution levels in an age of climate change and better health. Toronto (and Ontario) should be leaders in this transition not moving backwards.\n"
