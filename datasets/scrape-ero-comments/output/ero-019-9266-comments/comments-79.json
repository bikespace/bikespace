        "comment": "I am disturbed by the ministry's lack of consideration of available data from other jurisdictions that clearly show how bike lanes reduce traffic congestion by encouraging people to bike instead of drive. If everyone who bikes to work in Toronto (or other municipalities) drove instead, congestion would undoubtedly worsen. I know that MTO staff are aware of the concept of induced demand, where increasing traffic lanes leads to an increase in people driving and causing traffic, and I hope that senior ministry leadership and the Premier's Office learn about this concept and consult some actual data while considering this decision. Bike lanes are good for the environment, for the economy, for people's health and safety, and are an investment in managing traffic long term.\n"

I am unable to use subway/buses for my commute as I often have to travel outside of the city for work due to my company's return to office mandate.  To stay employed I have no choice but to commute to Mississauga/Brampton by car Monday to Friday.\nWith these lanes removed my travel times will reduce as a car driver, meaning I can spend less time commuting and more time with family/friends or catching some extra sleep every morning.\nI fully support the removal of the Bloor West bike lane, specifically from Jane Street to the 427\n"

Torontonians are realizing that bike lanes, street patios and the whole \"Complete Street\" initiative is creating massive congestion in this City. We are now the third most congested City in the world, attracting negative comments from visitors.\nVision Zero initiatives have done very little to improve safety on our streets, which by any rational measure are relatively safe. Twice as many people get shot in Toronto as are hit by a car or truck.\nIt might be different if the bike lanes attracted very much use. But they are underutilized even in the good weather and not at all in the winter, despite the City's expensive efforts to plow them.\n"

        "comment": "As a Toronto residents I am extremely opposed to the removal of existing bike lanes. These lanes were installed by our democratically elected municipal government using tax payer dollars, and their removal would be a huge waste of resources and a major overstep by the provincial government. Even worse, removing bike lanes will not reduce traffic, because studies have shown the bike lanes REDUCE traffic in addition to improving the safety of cyclists. Cyclists will continue to use the roads (as is their right), except they will be forced to ride in the same lanes as vehicles, thereby slowing down traffic. For those cyclists that no longer feel safe and are forced to drive, they will add more cars to the road. Nothing about this proposal makes sense from a fiscal or urban planning perspective. This is clearly a political move meant to satisfy suburban car-owners who have an irrational dislike for cyclists and the residents of Toronto as a whole, and do not care about our safety or the functionality of our roads. As someone who chooses not to use a car and contribute to traffic, I should be able to get around my city safely and efficiently. Bike lanes are proven to be a necessary component of effective urban transportation infrastructure.\n"

        "comment": "Building more highways and expanding roads will promote car and toronto being a car transit for the suburbs. This is outdated urban planning from the 50s which does not scale. We cant all drive and i dont know anyone that actually enjoys living on the side of a busy road. I am not even mentioning the environment, or energy costs. We need better and more incentivized public transportation and alter alternative options. We should de-incentivize transiting toronto core by car. There are numerous case studies in Europe that we should follow from urban planning. Building protected and maintained bike lanes is step in the right direction. This legislation is a step backwards and a distraction for a corrupt and misguided provincial government.\n"

Removing bike lanes and preventing them is not the answer. Where is the investment in improving public transit? We have a shameful lack of public infrastructure in Ontario to support non vehicular traffic. Putting more cyclists into cars will not alleviate the gridlock.\nI am also firmly against the 413.

        "comment": "While I can see the appeal of moving cars faster, I do not believe it should be at the cost of bike lanes. Ontario already struggles with public transit, and blotting out bike lanes with more cars I feel goes against the progress that has been made. This bill, while it does not strictly say that it is anti-bike. Would slow, and even reverse the progress that has been made towards more community based neighbourhoods and safe transit. If reducing congestion is the main concern, perhaps instead of making more car lanes, we should instead be investing in more public transit, so as to fit more people in a smaller space. Buses and subways are a prime example of this.\n"

Bike lanes provide essential infrastructure that protects cyclists, reduces traffic congestion (yes, the data reinforces thhs), and encourages more environmentally friendly commuting options. Eliminating them would increase the risk of accidents, discourage active transportation, and hamper the city's goal of reducing carbon emissions. With the rising cost of living, cycling remains an affordable option for many residents, and removing these lanes could limit access to efficient and safe commuting for those who rely on their bikes.\n"

        "comment": "This is such an unserious policy proposal. If the Premier actually wants to reduce gridlock (as we all do), he needs to embrace the data and the science that shows that other forms of transportation need to be made more safe and attractive in order to entice those who do not absolutely have to drive out of their cars. This means increased funding and condensed timelines for building and maintaining TTC and GO and and bike and pedestrian infrastructure. Ripping out bike lanes will only increase traffic congestion because this proposed law will force people who have already made the jump back into their cars. It also means an increase in senseless and completely avoidable road violence and death for vulnerable road users.\nMy primary issue with this proposed law, however, is that Ford is not the Mayor of Toronto and has to stop fixating on us. His jurisdiction is provincial affairs and I resent the province consistently overstepping and overriding municipal sovereignty. As he has said to others many times, \u201cstay in your lane\u201d! We elect city councillors to make decisions for the city and they are the people best positioned to make these decisions as they know local issues best. The Province needs to stop interfering in local democracy!\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nI am a resident of Spadina - Fort York and I would like to express my opposition to this bill. I am empathetic to the traffic conditions in Toronto; however, I believe that targeting bike lanes to solve this issue is not an effective approach and will hurt the city. I would like to share the following arguments for your consideration:\n(1) Adding car lanes does not reduce traffic in the long-term due to induced demand. Adding car lanes makes driving more attractive as a transportation option, which encourages more car trips, which contributes to traffic. This is a well-studied phenomenon that has been recently summarized in this article: https://www.cbc.ca/news/science/bike-lanes-impacts-1.7358319\n(2) Cycling is a very quickly growing form of transportation in Toronto, and in the long term it improves traffic outcomes. For example, a trip to work on a bike instead of a car removes a car from the streets, and the rider takes up much less road space. This has been demonstrated by investment into cycling infrastructure by many leading cities, including recently in Paris.\n(3) \"They don't make land anymore\". Cars take up a lot of space per person driving. As Toronto densifies, it is simply impossible to maintain good traffic levels. Housing can be densified in a given area by building upwards, but driving must happen at ground level (with rare exceptions). So, to keep large amounts of people moving in a densely populated area, the only viable solution is to invest in public transit and cycling. This will give more and more people good alternatives to driving, which will result in fewer cars on the streets and in turn less traffic.\n(4) This is a serious safety issue. People will not stop cycling on major thoroughfares. Cyclists' trip destinations are on those major streets (like Bloor, Yonge and University), and like drivers, cyclists want to complete their trips close to their destinations. As more and more people cycle on those streets, driving conditions for both cyclists and drivers will become more chaotic and complex. That creates worse outcomes for drivers too. No driver wants to accidentally cause someone's death because of unsafe conditions.\n(5) If cyclists aren't given bike lanes, they are entitled to take the car lane. This feels unsafe for any individual cyclist, but with a sufficient number of cyclists on a given route, it's likely that car lanes will simply become bike lanes by default - but in a more dangerous way. Traffic conditions in those scenarios will not be better than if a bike lane was in place. A car lane taken by a cyclist takes up more road space than a dedicated bike lane.\n(6) If we are willing to remove bike lanes from major streets, we should be equally willing to remove street parking from those streets. One parked car can reduce an entire stretch of road by a full lane.\n(7) Finally, I believe that it is inappropriate for the Ontario government to interfere with municipal affairs. Toronto streets are local streets managed by the city of Toronto. City residents elected a mayor in a fair democratic process, and that mayor had a clear policy stance on adding bike infrastructure during her campaign. It is not appropriate for the Ontario government to overrule the wishes of Toronto's residents in matters related strictly to the city of Toronto.\nI hope these factors are duly considered and addressed by the government in its decision-making process.\n"

        "comment": "Hi,\nI'm a south Oakville resident, and despite being a 2-car family, I am completely opposed to this. Municipalities and countries worldwide have realized that the only way to improve traffic flow is to provide viable alternatives. One of those alternatives is safe and separated bike lanes.\nIf we really want to improve the movement of people, investing in both public and safe active transit is the way to do it. This means more separated bike lanes to make sure families and commuters can get from their homes to wherever they need to go safely.\n"

Shame on Doug Ford, who seems to be ignoring every ESG recommendation (cough cough clear cutting 800+ mature trees at Ontario Place in the dead of night, don\u2019t even get me started). These bike lanes reduce traffic and are major thoroughfares for cyclists for both N-S (University, Yonge) and E-W (Bloor) travel. So many healthcare workers (myself included) and U of T students especially use the University and Bloor corridors to safely get to and from work every day. Not to mention the fact that anyone who walks, bikes, or drives along Bloor just had to endure months of impact to install these lanes in the first place\u2026 the idea of enduring that all again just to rip out a brand new bike lane on the taxpayers\u2019 dollar is both infuriating and boggles the mind.
