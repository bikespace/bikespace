        "comment": "THANK YOU, Ontario Government,\nFor STOPPING the construction of bicycle lanes, and REMOVING bicycle lanes that were installed without proper research.\nThe City of Toronto is killing the economy of our city by constricting the streets from car usage by reducing street lanes for bicycles.\nIt is counter-intuitive to efficiency and economic growth by blocking commuters and businesses from driving to destinations across the city for the sake of an absurd and forced \"15 Minute City\" ideology.\nResidents, small businesses and services should be able to drive throughout the GTA in an efficient and timely matter without being forced to use public transit that does not make logistical sense.\nFurthermore, in a Canadian city that experiences winter conditions for 8 out of 12 months of the year, bicycle lanes cannot be justified for such limited use.\nLastly, as a resident on Portland Street in downtown Toronto, I observe Portland, Spadina and Bathurst Street all experiencing gridlock each weekend from 9pm-3am due to the nightlife, and the proposed PORTLAND - DAN LECKIE CYCLING CONNECTION Proposal would eliminate 2-way traffic on Portland Street. This would add further gridlock and delays during rush hour and weekends.  This is unacceptable!\nTHANK YOU Ontario Government for COMMON SENSE and putting a STOP to this nonsense, and PLEASE STOP further bicycle lanes from slowing down our economy without proper research and solutions for a win-win for all people, whether drivers, commuters or cyclists!\n"

        "comment": "Urban Sprawl and Long-Term Urban Planning\nDefinition of Urban Sprawl and its Characteristics\nUrban sprawl refers to the uncoordinated expansion of urban areas into surrounding rural landscapes. Typically characterized by low-density, automobile-dependent development and segregated land use, sprawl often undermines efforts to create cohesive and sustainable communities.\nKey Issues Caused by Sprawl:\nEnvironmental Impacts\nLoss of valuable agricultural land and natural habitats, contributing to biodiversity decline.\nIncreased air and water pollution due to extended automobile use and inefficient infrastructure.\nEconomic Impacts\nHigher costs for extending roads, utilities, and services across sprawling areas, burdening taxpayers.\nWeakening of urban centers as residents and businesses migrate to suburban areas, leaving downtown cores underutilized.\nSocial Impacts\nDispersed communities reduce opportunities for social interaction and diminish community identity.\nLimited access to essential services and employment opportunities for non-drivers or those in underserved areas.\nAlternative Planning Approaches:\nTransit-Oriented Development (TOD)\nBy concentrating dense, mixed-use developments near public transportation hubs, TOD reduces car reliance, shortens commutes, and fosters walkable, vibrant neighborhoods.\nMixed-Use Zoning\nIntegrating residential, commercial, and recreational land uses creates dynamic, inclusive communities, minimizing the need for long-distance travel.\nGreenbelt Policies\nProtecting natural areas and agricultural lands with greenbelt designations curbs unchecked urban expansion while promoting more efficient land use.\nA Critical Perspective on Highway Projects and Sprawl\nHighway projects have a dual impact on urban development. On one hand, they improve transportation networks and can stimulate economic activity. On the other hand, they often induce demand for development in outlying areas, accelerating urban sprawl.\nOntario's Highway 413 is emblematic of this debate. While proponents argue the highway will alleviate traffic congestion and promote economic growth, critics highlight its potential to encourage unsustainable suburban expansion, degrade environmentally sensitive areas, and exacerbate long-term infrastructure and environmental costs.\nCase Studies\nFailure: Unchecked Sprawl in American Suburbs\nThe post-World War II suburban boom in the U.S. resulted in car-centric communities, deteriorating urban centers, and increased socioeconomic disparities. Long commutes and inefficient land use led to higher pollution and weakened community ties.\nSuccess: Copenhagen\u2019s Sustainable Planning\nCopenhagen, Denmark, has prioritized bicycle infrastructure, robust public transit, and dense, mixed-use development. These measures have reduced car dependence, enhanced livability, and fostered strong community bonds, serving as a model for sustainable urban planning.\nConclusion: Highway Expansion and Sustainable Development\nWhile highway expansions like Ontario's Highway 413 may offer short-term solutions to traffic congestion, their alignment with long-term sustainability goals is highly questionable. These projects risk exacerbating urban sprawl, with significant environmental, economic, and social costs.\nInstead, prioritizing alternatives like compact development, public transit investment, and greenbelt protection represents a more sustainable path. These approaches promote resilient communities that balance growth with environmental and social well-being, ensuring a future where cities and regions thrive sustainably.\nI personally disagree with the direction this bill is taking our community, and I am concerned about the kind of future this is creating for our children.\n"

I am 73 years old and I have forgotten a few times. Some bike riders are watching in case predestrians make a mistake but other bike riders fly by yelling and scaring me to death. And going super fast. Motorized bike also use the lanes and so do joggers. The area I live in is a very high density of seniors.

        "comment": "I can buy the bike lanes on Bloor West have a bad impact on traffic, but this talking point is disappointing as a cycling advocate, because in this case where a local community is bringing up major issues with transport infrastructure, perhaps some compromise is needed, a new design that lowers lane widths and allows another lane, or asking transportation engineers to reexamine things.\nThis isn't what Bill 212 is about, it's a knee-jerk reaction that stunts and damages cycling in the city forever (or until this provincial government is eventually voted out). It's a terrible waste of resources and manpower, and will make the city worse and more dangerous.\nThe province doesn't need to hide behind the shield that \"bike lanes everywhere\" are an issue, Doug represents Etobicoke interests, he could have this legislation just order a re-evaluation of the bike lanes west of High Park. He's not because this isn't sincere legislation.\nTake the Honourable Minister Sarkaria's statements; \"1.2% of cyclists shouldn't take up 50% of road space.\" His 1.2% figure comes from StatsCan in 2011, over the entire CMA, which includes cities like Richmond Hill. His statistic is also specifically in commuting, which doesn't address that people also bike for leisure, or to get to appointments, or to go shopping. According to this CBC article (Percentage of bike riders higher where lanes are installed: StatsCan | CBC News), 70% of Torontonians cycle in some capacity. (There is also the 8.3% figure in University Rosedale, I will touch that later)\nNow I'm a student at TMU, I commute in from Willowdale, and I bought a bikeshare membership. The bikeshare is probably one of the best purchases I've ever made, the downtown cycling network is fragile and fragmented, but it exists.\nAs a student at TMU, and with our campus bordering lovely Church, Yonge, Dundas, and Gerrard, I can positively say that the downtown core is absolutely infested with bicycles, and why shouldn't it? I cannot step outside without seeing AT LEAST 1 cyclist passing by, and I cannot walk along Gerrard, Yonge, or Dundas without a decadent glut of bicycles passing by.\nWhy shouldn't the downtown be infested? It's the only part of the city with a legitimate cycle network. It provides for tons of trips. I am at TMU, Yonge & Dundas/Gerrard area. I can bike along Gerrard and College to have a nice stroll at Queens Park. I can use Gerrard/Wellesley to visit friends at UofT. I can use Shuter/Dundas to get east to visit a TPL branch that has a book I've been meaning to get. I can use Gerrard/University/Richmond/Adelaide to get anywhere in the financial district. Or University/Simcoe to get to the waterfront. The network actually exists downtown, and that's where the cycling is.\nThe College, Gerrard, and Adelaide/Richmond lanes are heavily used in my experience. Also interestingly, many \"side streets\" near to me are also usually infested with cyclists. Church, with it's proximity to Yonge, relation to the TMU campus, and lower traffic volumes/parking is an ideal north-south connector (if you're willing). Yonge's businesses also bring in a lot of both delivery drivers and regular cyclists. I honestly would put car and bike traffic on Yonge street as somewhat comparable, maybe not 50/50, not yet, but close. Dundas also gets plenty of bike traffic, but biking on Dundas is very sketchy.\nAnd it's no wonder these side streets get cyclists, the bike network is bursting it's bounds! Yonge and Church are two lane roads with not as much traffic, a protected cycle track would exponentially increase ridership. (Tearing up bike lanes will cost nearly $50 million, Toronto city staff report says - The Trillium) This article pegs cycle ridership boosting by as little as 28% and as high as 650%! If Yonge St. bike traffic increases by 600%, the bikes are going to be the ones in gridlock (except they won't because bikes are far more efficient than cars).\nThese lanes are useful, Toronto continually improves it's cycling network and number of cyclists. As I said before, I just bought a bikeshare membership. I know several friends who also just bought bikeshare memberships. In September bikeshare reached a high mark of over 35,000 cycle rides in a day. That number will be larger next year.\nBut I also know so many who won't bike because it's unsafe. I'll brave Yonge St. and Dundas St. for the time saved, many of my friends and many Torontonians won't. That's why we need WHOLE bike networks, so that it provides for all trips.\nIt's also worth noting by removing bike lanes on arterial roads, the province has almost certainly condemned a person to death. They'll be runover after merging left to avoid an illegally stopped car on Bloor, and will never see their family ever again, they may be eating dinner now unaware they only have 533 days left of life.\nI attest that while I love the downtown cycle network, it's so fragile and fragmented. Going STRAIGHT west from TMU is a nightmare because I don't want to die on Dundas Street. Getting to City Hall sucks because Bay St. is a death trap. Many trips I make I have to detour to use safer infrastructure. Getting to Bloor-Yonge for the TPL sucks because Yonge St. isn't nice to cycle on, the only saving grace is that there's other cyclists, and a car could cut me off and kill me, but can't kill me AND 5 other cyclists. I have a friend who lives along Jarvis, it'd be nice to bike to him, but I won't cause I'm unwilling to bike on an unprotected Jarvis.\nThe downtown network is fragmented and fragile. And I have to be real, Toronto's cycle network is straight up unfinished. It can't be graded because it's being built. Only when the network is extensive, when people can use it for the majority of their trips, can Toronto become Amsterdam.\nCheck the google maps look at what our cycle network looks like, and what Amsterdam's network looks like. Toronto's network is straight up unfinished.\nGetting back to that 8.3% figure from University Rosedale. Even that figure isn't super amazing, but it also makes sense, our network is small and fledgling. To turn an infestation into a full blown flood, a real modal shift from cars to bikes, Toronto needs to double, then triple it's bike infrastructure. It probably needs GO Expansion level service and the new rapid transit lines to open so people don't have to drive, at which a point there can be a congestion charge. (measures that discourage driving CAN ONLY BE DONE IF AND ONLY IF reasonable and compelling alternatives exist already).\nIt's for these reasons that Bill 212 deeply upsets me. Toronto's fragile network serves many, and doesn't provide service many more. There is not a single kilometer of bike lane that can be removed. The only solution to the Bloor West bike lane's causing congestion is increased GO Train Service, and dramatically expanding the bike lane network so the drivers stuck in traffic bite the bullet and buy a bikeshare membership. People cycle in Finland, and Toronto frankly doesn't get enough interesting weather for cycling to be infeasible here. It's November and cold already and I still see plenty of people out cycling.\nThe Province is going to spend 50 million dollars (or more, see every Metrolinx project for estimates on cost overruns) to destroy already built and necessary infrastructure. The lane on University was just renovated to be a world class cycle road, fit to be a flagship lane in the Netherlands. It'll be destroyed to turn University into a 4 LANE ARTERIAL in downtown! That won't fix traffic. It'll be better for a year, then everyone and their mother will try and clog onto the 401 and Gardiner to take advantage of the new \"clear, bike-free downtown\", only to clog the streets yet again.\nThen Doug Ford will be voted out (maybe not the next election, but eventually, no-one rules forever), and the city will waste even more money rebuilding this infrastructure again, when the congestion is even worse. Congestion won't be solved by building more roads. We've been doing that strategy for the past century. The 401 keep's widening, but the traffic keeps getting worse.\n50 million dollars could be an emergency fund to end the slow zones crippling the TTC, or could be a fund to install smart traffic signals along Bloor that ensure smooth flows, or could go to police to enforce no stopping (I see so many cars illegally stopped on Yonge and Dundas it's insane). It can go to anywhere but ripping out existing infrastructure.\nWe're going to be here again, asking to tackle congestion. In 2050, with 5 or 10 million more people, do you want to tackle congestion using new GO Train lines, more TTC service, and bike lane expansions, or do you want to discuss spending 20 billion dollars to widen the Gardiner? Every single traffic and transportation engineer recognizes the need to prioritize transit and active transportation, we have to do that, eat the pain now, and triumph in becoming the best city in North America by 2040.\n"

        "comment": "The proposal to remove bike lanes from University Avenue is short-sighted and poorly planned. Of all the Toronto bike lanes that are under review for removal, the University Avenue lanes are likely the most used - and at all times of the day and night. These lanes help hospital and university employees get to and from work, help delivery bikes get to their clients, and help improve the safety of other non-vehicle users. A narrower University Avenue helps slow traffic at times of the day when there are fewer cars present; prior to the addition of the bike lane, cars would more frequently speed down the street, ignore traffic stop lines - stopping in the crosswalk, and drive with disregard for pedestrian safety. Regarding the rerouting of the lane, something to consider is that there is no continuous secondary street that runs from Front Street to Bloor Street on which to reroute a protected lane. To promote safety for all who use the street, I urge the Ministry of Transportation to keep the existing bike lanes.\n"

Bicycle lanes are legitimate lanes too! They keep the flow cycling traffic moving so that cyclist can stay away from cars, thus improving traffic congestion.  The closure of bicycle lanes WILL cause MORE accidents! When bicycles are required to share the road with cars, without a dedicated lanes for bikes, often times this can be very unsafe for cyclists. Many drivers speed above the limit, as well as keep their eyes on their cell phones while driving; making sharing the road space with cyclists more dangerous and more likely to be involved in collisions/accidents. Certainly the more accidents we have, the more traffic congestion will worsen.\n     This entire Bill seems to be focused only on the benefit of car drivers. What the Government is forgetting is that NOT all Ontarians drive cars. Many of us find it difficult afford the high cost of living in Toronto, as a result, many of us ride bicycles to go to work, shopping, appointments etc.  If bike lanes are removed on Yonge St, Bloor St, and University Avenue, This will NOT \"Save you time\". In fact the removal of these lanes will directly affect many bike commuters, because we will be forced to take side streets which will make their journey much LONGER! They will have no choice but to try and share the roadway and \"fight\" for space with drivers, thus slowing down the flow of car traffic.\n     My child commutes by bike to high school 4.9km per direction. Luckily, he has the benefit of using bike lanes for 80% of his commute. If the Bloor St bike lane is removed, his safety on his bike will be in jeopardy. I'm very concerned for the safety of all of the cyclist who will be affected by the removal of any of the well-used and well-loved bike lanes in Toronto.\nWhat a complete WASTE of money and time it will be to take out bike lanes that have already been researched, funded, and installed!\n     In closing, I wanted to make you aware that removing bike lanes will have a direct effect on pedestrians. Often times, when cyclists feel unsafe or when there is no space on the road, they will choose to ride on the sidewalk. Unfortunately, closing bike lanes will decrease the safety of pedestrians, including Seniors, parents with baby strollers, and people of all ages. Including the people who drive, because we are all pedestrians.\nThank you for reading my comment.\n"

        "comment": "Government of Ontario should encourage cycling as it provides multiple benefits:\n1. Improves  physical and mental health. By providing opportunities for physical exercise during regular daily commutes.\n2. Lowers pollution and environmental impacts. Average family car requires disposal of a set of 4 tires every 4 - 5 years and other mechanical, electrical and electronic parts that deteriorate due to car use on a regular basis.\n3. Saves costs. By replacing a second family car with a bicycle, a family can save about $100,000 over the period of 10 years in purchase and maintenance costs.\nThus building new cycling infrastructure, rather then removing existing one, seems like a more beneficial long term investment of government efforts and taxpayer money.\n\"The legislation would also, if passed, provide the province with the authority to establish a review process on other existing bike lanes (where the removal of a lane of traffic took place).\"\nIn my opinion it would be beneficial if province will remove red tape and bureaucratic obstacles rather then add them, increasing time and cost to neighborhood development.\n\"The Ontario government is proposing an addendum to the framework that would require the province to remove sections of the Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue bike lanes in the City of Toronto and return them to a lane of traffic for motor vehicles.\"\nTransportation within the city, outside of major highways, should be prerogative of municipalities and local residents. If this is absolutely necessary to remove bicycle lanes from these streets, alternatives that don't impact travel time, convenience and safety of cyclists should be proposed and implemented before the removal of existing infrastructure.\nInstead of spending time and taxpayer money on unnecessary legislation and removal of functional infrastructure, it would be beneficial if Provincial Government concentrates its efforts on developing transit options between municipalities in Ontario, including GTA.\n"
