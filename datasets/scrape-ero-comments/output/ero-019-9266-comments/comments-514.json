Having the separated bike lanes help encourage me to ride more as a newer cyclist. Instead of taking transit or driving (adding another car on the road which increases traffic), cycling is a great option which can also save money from OHIP (if cars don\u2019t hit me and if my health is better due to exercising more). Please reconsider and do not destroy the already built bike paths as it\u2019s a waste of tax payer money to destroy what was already built.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is a huge overreach. Bike lanes are municipal decisions. Let residents and councillors decide where bike lanes should go or not go. That alone should be sufficient reason for the bill to be voted down.\nI believe that designing roads to move cars quickly is totally at odds with creating places where people want to be. I live near the Cliffside strip on Kingston road, which could be such a nicer place if drivers didn't treat it like a highway. Think of the places where you'd want to have a coffee or meal on a patio. Fast car traffic is the antithesis of such a place. Bloor St and Yonge St are places to walk and sit and shop, and have become nicer places since the addition of bike lanes, making the streets quieter and safer.\nMr. Sarkaria claims that the percentage of cyclists is 1.2%, but this video, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FZDEehlaC4 (1:28 through 3:43), shows maps using census data of downtown Toronto that illustrates that cyclist modal share is actually in the range of 5-15%. More people will bike if safe infrastructure is provided, and a sufficient network to be able to get to one's destination.\nSomeone with the job title \"Minister of Transportation\" should appropriately weigh the needs of all types of transportation, including bicycle, e-bike, scooter, and so on. Some car drivers see these other modes of transportation as nuisances, but the real cause of traffic is Too Many Cars. There aren't any bike lanes on the 401, and yet it has 14 lanes often clogged with drivers. Virtually zero of the roads with on/off ramps have bike lanes, lest it be suggested that those streets are the cause of 401 gridlock.\nIf the Ontario government could build a big enough network of safe cycling infrastructure , more people would choose to cycle, freeing up road space for car and truck traffic.\nSome people will never bike because they work too far from their home. Ontario can get Metrolinx to complete transit lines and increase all-day GO frequency. Again, that will free up road space for car and truck traffic.\nI hope the government makes a responsible decision.\n"

I live in Windsor, which has terrible traffic congestion because there are too few transit options and virtually no bicycle lanes. Instead of removing them, the province should be mandating that cities include cycling infrastructure in all future city planning. As someone who is required to use a vehicle for work, I want more people to have transit and cycling options instead of clogging up the road with their cars. I strongly oppose this bill.\n"

        "comment": "I commute from south west Scarborough to downtown Toronto several days each week for work.  As a subway/walking commuter into the downtown core I find that the bike lanes on Bloor have been a huge improvement to the area.  I can only speak to the portion of Bloor St. that I frequent.\nI exit the subway at the intersection of St. George and bloor between 8:20am and 8:45am on several weekdays throughout the week.  I return to the same intersection between 5:00pm and 5:45pm.  I also often walk down a portion of Bloor street from St. George to Sherbourne.\nWhen I exit the subway at St. George in the morning, I can honestly describe the intersection of St. George and Bloor as peaceful.  Busy but not stressful at all, which I feel is a strange thing to say about an intersection at the core of the city.  I noticed this change after the new bike lanes along Bloor St. were put in.\nMy observation is that the car traffic is flowing along Bloor St smoothly.  I do mean smoothly.  I understand that the proposred removal of bike lanes is to speed up car traffic.  I don't believe that cars can safely move any faster given the numer of traffic lights and pedestrians in the area.  With the current road configuration (that includes bike lanes) traffic moves without cars cutting eachother off, blocking intersections (unless someone tries to make an illegal left turn at Bay St.) or cutting off pedestrians.  The rules of the road are much cleaner.  Go when it's your turn and stay in your lane, car or bike.\nMy observations of the bike lanes on Bloor are below:\n-The bike lanes are well utilized\n-I feel much safer as a pedestrian in the area\n-Car traffic is flowing smoothly\nAs a side note, the food carriers count as cyclists.  They reduce the number of car trips that people ordering food would be making to pick up their own orders.  They deserve to be kept safe.\nThe city needs to increase the number of people it moves.  Adding more cars in the downtown core is not a viable way to do that.  The wonderful new subway lines are years away from being completed and we need to get cars off downtown roads.  Having an integrated straight forward network of protected lanes for cyclists is a great way to move more people within the city core.\nI currently use my bike on the city's recreational trails.  I have seriously considered making my commute to work by bike but the cycling infrastructure in my neighborhood is lacking.  My cycling options include taking busy roads like Warden Ave which is incredibly unsafe given the speed of cars on those roads or riding on the sidewalk which is not safe for pedestrians.  I belive that a city should be allowed to make it's own decisions when planning and expand it's cycling network. They have a large team if skilled urban planners that understand the city and it's needs.  I worry that the proposed bill 212 will stop the planned expansion of the bike lanes in my neighborhood.  The bike lanes that would allow me to safely make more of my everyday trips by bike.  I live in the \"inner suburbs\" of the city and I believe that cycling is a variable mode of transportation for me but I'm not willing to get hit by a car to prove it.  Adding safe and seperared bicycle lanes is essential for reducing traffic in the city.   As urban planners tend to say \"build it and they will come\".  If we build the bike lane infrastructure, people will get out of their cars and onto bikes which will leave more room on the roads for people that choose to drive.\nImagine being able to send a highschool aged child to school on their bike, knowing they will get to class safley.\n Instead of the parent's fighting traffic to drop them off and pick them up in a car every day.  Just a thought as someone that gets to see that traffic jam play out regularly.\n"

As a home owner in Toronto, I want diverse, safe transit alternatives to driving. Bill 212 will not save my family and I any time. It will cost us time and money -- both the taxes that we have already paid to install bike lane infrastructure, but also the ever-increasing cost of parking and lost time sitting in traffic (Dundas West has no bike lanes and still suffers from congestion). I want more bike lanes, not more car congestion and exhaust emissions in my neighbourhood. If cars are unable to move quickly alongside a world-class public transit system, perhaps funding public transit would help accelerate people's commute times? I live on Bloor Street and will be directly impacted by this decision. It is for these reasons that I strongly oppose bill 212.\n"

        "comment": "To whom it may concern,\nI am a 22 year old engineering student at the University of Toronto, living at College and Spadina, and I\u2019m writing today to voice my concerns about Bill 212. I have lived my entire life in Toronto, and have traveled and explored throughout the city. I wanted to start by talking about some of the ways that I use 3 streets which Bill 212 has targeted for removal of bike lanes: Bloor, College, and University. When I was living with my parents in Leaside, my daily commute took me along Bloor street from Church to Spadina, although these days I usually follow College. Outside of my commute, I use College street to visit restaurants in Little Italy, go grocery shopping, and visit High Park. I take Bloor street to my gym, to hang out at Christie Pits Park and visit my parents. Finally, I usually follow University south to get to downtown concert venues, watch Leafs games, or visit our beautiful harbourfront parks.\nI regularly use either my bicycle or my car for these trips, depending on several factors such as the weather, time of day, and how I\u2019m feeling. However, the most important factor for me is safety: when I feel safe riding my bike, I\u2019ll usually ditch the car. The recent upgrades and additions to bike lanes on all three of these streets has vastly  increased my safety and therefore willingness to take my bike on these trips rather than driving. In no uncertain terms: improvements to bike lane infrastructure vastly increases the likelihood that I leave my car behind when I travel the city. If the provincial government's goal is to reduce congestion, the simplest way to do that is to have less cars on the streets, and the simplest way to do that is to give people high quality infrastructure so they have the freedom to choose the transportation option that they want to use.\nI am not alone in feeling this way. I have many friends who feel like cycling in Toronto is too unsafe because they are forced to cycle alongside cars, trucks, and cargo vehicles who frequently demonstrate disregard for the safety of cyclists trying to share their roads. Many have been victims of road rage or collisions. But these are preventable incidents. We should have infrastructure which will help people who are otherwise forced to drive, feel safe cycling.\nThank you for reading my comment, and I once again want to urge you NOT to pass Bill 212, as I believe it will increase congestion, and make cycling less safe.\n"

Just because you want to save a few minutes of a driver's time (which studies don't even support) doesn't mean that should be prioritized over people's lives. Removing bike lanes will literally cause people to die. Someone waiting an extra few minutes in traffic will not. A 13 year old cyclist died because the province continues to prioritize drivers above everyone else and encourages their reckless driving. You need to show actual leadership and show that you prioritize safety first.\n"

        "comment": "In the strongest possible words, I completely oppose this proposal. Here are some reasons why:\nTraffic congestion isn't caused due to bikes, it's caused due to cars. How many bike congested bike lanes do you actually come across as opposed car congested roads? Bikes have a way higher density of transportation as compared to cars and are actively reducing car traffic on the road. Contrary to what this proposal suggests, bike lanes are helping achieve less congestion, not contributing to it, and so should be left as intact. To reduce congestion, the province should be investing more in delivering existing LRT projects on time. This proposal is detrimental and backwards.\nSecondly, the bike lanes costed 4.5 million dollars of tax payer money. The province's decision to demolish the bike infrastructure is a colossal waste of that tax payer money. Not to mention, the additional cost it'll require to remove it.\nThirdly, this isn't an issue of wasted finances, the provincial government is actively jeopardizing people's lives. Bike lanes have proven to be more safe repeatedly for riders and the absence of bike lanes is not going to reduce the number of bikers on the road, it'll just lead to the same amount of riders but more accidents.\nAgain, the province's proposal to remove bike lanes is backwards, irresponsible, dangerous and a colossal waste of tax payer dollars. I oppose it strongly.\n"

While I recognize the importance of addressing congestion, this bill overlooks essential aspects of sustainable urban planning and environmental health.\nFirstly, the removal of existing bike lanes in Toronto will deter active transportation, an option many residents depend on for commuting safely and sustainably. Active transportation reduces traffic congestion and contributes to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Removing bike lanes will hinder these benefits, increasing car dependency and adding strain to already congested roads.\nSecondly, Bill 212\u2019s exemption of certain highway projects from environmental assessments raises significant concerns. Environmental assessments are crucial for safeguarding our ecosystems, protecting biodiversity, and ensuring developments do not harm local air, soil, and water quality. The proposed changes could result in highways that ignore environmental risks, contributing to long-term environmental degradation.\nBill 212\u2019s approach could set a troubling precedent for prioritizing short-term convenience over sustainable development. I urge you to reconsider this legislation and support solutions that balance infrastructure improvements with environmental and community needs.\nThank you for considering my concerns.\n"

I am a cyclist and drive a truck so I see from both perspectives (cyclist, driver). I regularly commute to Toronto\u2019s downtown for work. Due to bad driver etiquette, I see more causes of gridlock caused by drivers (e.g. blocking intersections). Having a bike lane instead of another vehicle lane increases safety for pedestrians exiting streetcars (there is daily occurrence of drivers speeding past open transit doors to catch the green light. Active people are healthier people which is good for the provincial health system. Tourists would find our city more appealing with safe cycling infrastructure (increasing revenue for city and province). Who travels somewhere to visit because there are lots of car lanes and no cycling lanes? Please don\u2019t take away bike lanes - there are reasons why the bike lanes are located where cyclists (who are also taxpayers) would use them after much study.\n"
