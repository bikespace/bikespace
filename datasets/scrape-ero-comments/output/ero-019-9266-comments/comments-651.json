        "comment": "As a Toronto resident who regularly cycles for both commuting and weekend shopping, I am deeply concerned about and strongly oppose Bill 212.\nBike lanes are essential for my safety and the safety of countless others who rely on them. Cycling on roads without bike lanes is intimidating and dangerous, especially on busy and major streets. Bike lanes create a safer and more predictable environment for all road users, including drivers.\nRemoving existing bike lanes is not only a waste of resources but also disregards the proven benefits they bring to Toronto. Studies consistently show that bike lanes reduce traffic congestion, improve safety for everyone on the road, support local businesses by increasing foot and bike traffic, and contribute to environmental sustainability. These critical advantages appear to have been ignored\u2014or worse, deliberately misrepresented\u2014during the drafting of this bill.\nFinally, decisions about bike infrastructure should be made at the municipal level, where local leaders can better understand and address the needs of their constituents. Provincial interference undermines the ability of cities like Toronto to plan for safer and more sustainable transportation networks.\nI urge decision-makers to reject this bill and instead prioritize evidence-based policies that enhance safety, mobility, and quality of life for all residents.\n"

As a City of Toronto home owner and taxpayer, I expect the City to make decisions consistent with City of Toronto priorities. The province should defer to the City, who know the issues best, rather than prioritizing the needs of people who live in the suburbs. If people in Etobicoke don't want bike lanes take them away in Etobicoke, but leave the bike lanes in downtown Toronto.\n"

It used to be so much more unsafe when the bike lane didn't exist.\nThe Ontario government shouldn't be imposing red tape and bureaucracy on local infrastructure like bike lanes. It should be left up to the people who are residents of that city.\n6 cyclists have died in traffic accidents this year. Removing the bike lanes is only going to make the safety issue worse, and make drivers more nervous when they have to share the lane with cyclists.\nThis is a needless waste of taxpayer money. We paid to put the bike lanes in initially, and everybody waited extra time in traffic due to that initial construction. Now you want to pay more to rip them out, to create more construction, when they will probably just go in again when ford is out?? what a needless waste!\nIf the bike lanes are ripped out, the traffic improvements for commuters will be marginal at best , but it will have a disproportionate negative affect on cyclists who actually live in the city.\n"

Any removal will contribute to interfering with traffic which is counter to the idea of reducing gridlock.\nThis is just a political move by the government to divide people on an issue where people should be uniting to encourage public transport, diminish gas emissions by decreasing car traffic, and encourage healthy and safe exercise by cycling in the city. Removing these bike lanes will have 0 impact. It may embolden more drivers to take to the roads. All this is counterproductive. Every major city in the world from Paris, Amsterdam, Barcelona or New York City is developing their bike lanes and decreasing car presence. Think of air pollution and our health.

Removing and preventing bike lanes in cities will not improve gridlock and will instead likely increase congestion and traffic and will make cities less safe and increase accidents on the roads. Rather than addressing underlying causes of high and increased vehicle traffic or investing in alternative modes of transportation, this proposal demonstrates an outrageous lack of understanding of how cities, traffic, and transportation work. There are so many examples and cases around the world of thriving cities with efficient transportation and traffic flow predicated on effective bike travel and bike lanes. It is embarrassing as a province to suggest moving away from strong urban planning and backward in the form of removing and preventing bike lanes. This proposal should not be approved.\n"

If we must increase road lanes there are so many more things that would speed up the traffic downtown \u2014 fixing street parking to start. Imagine if we cleared up those lanes dedicated to parking for MOVING traffic instead, same way that bike lanes move cars.\nAnother is ride sharing. Ride sharing drivers are also the most notorious for breaking traffic rules further endangering and inconveniencing other drivers. Bike lanes are the only way cyclists can travel even remotely safely with all the aggressive drivers downtown.\nDon\u2019t let the rest of Ontario decide what is best for the city that contributes most of the provinces GDP. Their experience and point of view has no bearing on what it takes to operate the city\n"

We can have bike lanes on some more minor thoroughfares and encourage rides to travel through neighborhoods as much as possible where speeds are already decreased.

Cars are not an efficient means of mass transit. Investing in alternatives to cars such as bikes, buses, and trains is a solution. Biking is better for traffic, the environment, safety, and city budgets.\n"

        "comment": "The removal of bicycle lanes in the City of Toronto should not be done.\nIt is an inappropriate use of resources. The removal process will be costly, on top of the cost of planning and implementing them. The removal of bike lanes is not a high priority initiative for tax dollars, especially when compared to other important issues such as access to healthcare and affordable housing. Spending tax dollars on this initiative means that residents outside of the City of Toronto will be paying for something that does not affect them at all, and will miss out on the opportunity for improvements such as health care investment across the province.\nIt would reduce safety for all road users. For both drivers and cyclists, separated bike lanes promote safety and prevent risk of collisions. The government should be investing in initiatives that reduce risk of road injuries and deaths, not initiatives that heighten the risk. (see source: When protected bike lanes are installed in New York City, injury crashes for all road users (drivers, pedestrians, and cyclists) typically drop by 40% and by more than 50% in some locations. Wolfson, H., 2011  - Memorandum on Bike Lanes, City of New York, Office of the Mayor, 21 March 2011)\nIt would not achieve the goal of the bill, of reducing congestion. The City of Toronto is home to many and a growing number of residents, and its roads cannot and should not be expected to accommodate additional people in personal vehicles. As the population grows, investing in more space for cars will lead to more cars which will lead to more congestion. Many households do not own a car. Public investments should focus on options to efficiently moving large numbers of individuals, including transit and active transportation. Studies of congestion after bike lane installation find it does not lead to greater congestion for cars and in some cases lowers congestion (https://www.cbc.ca/news/science/bike-lanes-impacts-1.7358319)\nKeeping bike lanes would respect municipal decision making processes, and would lead to positive environmental, public health, and economic benefits. A study of the Bloor Street bike lanes found positive benefits for local businesses. The number of BikeShare uses has increased significantly (https://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2024/cc/bgrd/backgroundfile-250545\u2026).\nI urge the government to forego the removal of bike lanes in Toronto and the restrictions on building new bike lanes.\n"

This is increasing as we build more and bigger condominiums. The existing emphasis on cars only is not working already. We need alternatives. Bike lanes encourage people to get out of their cars and use alternative transportation.\nI am also opposed to the Ontario government interfering in matters that are a municipal matter. Toronto is a big city wit a professional planning department. It has met the highest standards for planning. City Council has voted overwhelmingly for the Bloor St bike lane. The province should respect Toronto and should not interfere in this matter.\nToronto has statistics and studies going back decades on bike lanes. The Province has provided nothing similar to support their position.\nFinally if the province proceeds in ordering Toronto to remove bike lanes, thy should pay for this to happen. It is a provincial decision, therefore a provincial cost\n"

        "comment": "There is simple way to reduce car congestion. Give people a credible alternative that gets them out of their cars and gets them where they need to go. Separated bike lanes reduce the number of cars on the road, and protect cyclists and drivers. If you take away a bike lane, where do you think that the bikes are going to go? Some people are going to get back in their cars and create more traffic. Others will keep riding but now they're going to be in the main lanes with the cars. This will also make it slower to travel by car. Cyclists are not going to take side streets because these are often at best inefficient and indirect routes that add too much travel time, and at worst impossible routes that don't connect the points of departure and arrival.\nIt's easy to predict what will happen when bike lanes are gone. According to the Highway Traffic Act, slow moving vehicles must keep the right *as much as is safe*. This often means riding approximately 1 meter from the curb. Riding too close to the curb isn't safe for a bike because cars will always try to squeeze by when there isn't enough space. Cars will have to slow to wait until it is safe to pass. Again, The Highway Traffic Act requires a minimum of 1 meter between the passing car and the bicycle. How does this scenario make it possible for cars to move through the city more quickly? The answer is simple. It does not.\nWith cyclists back in the main road lanes, drivers will become even more impatient than they are. They will not wait. They will pass too closely. Impatient and frustrated drivers in their cars will hit cyclists. Impatient and frustrated drivers in their cars will injure cyclists. Impatient and frustrated drivers in their cars will kill cyclists.\nWhat about increases in automobile insurance premiums that will result from all these additional risks of collision, personal injury, and death?\nThe current government has never given up the chance to choose good politics over good policy. Stop pandering to rural and suburban voters who very literally have no skin in the game, and who are also in all likelihood going to vote Conservative anyway. For a government that loves to say it is \"for the people\" it sure isn't listening to the ones who will be most affected by this legislation.\nCongestion is a real problem in Toronto. It needs a real solution that takes people out of their cars and helps them get where they need to go in other ways. For all the Ford government's talk about making Toronto a world-class city, it needs to do something that takes us in that direction. It doesn't need to go through this obvious political show that will benefit nobody. The other world class cities like London, Paris, Amsterdam, New York City, and even Montreal (where people use the bikes lanes in the middle of a much harder and longer winter that Toronto's) are watching what the Ford government is doing. When they're not shaking their heads in disbelief at the Ford government's small minded plan, they're laughing at its foolishness.\n"

        "comment": "I am against this bill. It is proven that bike lanes reduce car traffic when implemented in a way that makes the cyclist feel safe from cars. Adding more car lanes to a road only creates an effect called \"induced demand\", which then leads to more traffic on roads where call lanes are added or left in place.\nBy not trusting cities to make their own decisions on bike lanes, we also put cyclists at risk. By removing bike lanes and not allowing for bike lanes to be built, we force cyclists to ride WITH cars. It is dangerous, and as someone who is a car user and a bike user, it makes passing a cyclist more difficult. When cyclists have their own dedicated lanes, it is better for everyone.\nWhen we take a car lane of traffic away from cars, we also reduce road noise and make areas of our cities more enjoyable as a pedestrian also. There are so many roads that people hate walking beside because it is a 6 lane stroad (a road that neither functions well as a road nor a street, but is somehow both). We cannot reduce traffic by reducing bike lanes and maintaining large multi-lane roads because the issue with traffic is the square footage use on roads. Cars take up a larger footprint on roads than bikes and transit per person. With cycling and transit you can fit more people in a smaller amount of road pavement. Transit and cycling infrastructure is efficiency of road space and usage.\nThere are people like myself who would rather cycle and transit than drive my car. When I live close to transit or safe bike infrastructure, I choose to take those instead of driving. There are other people like me who will choose alternatives to driving if they are given proper infrastructure. By getting people like me out of cars and onto bike lanes and transit, we reduce traffic for those who choose to or must drive, because we remove the amount of cars on the road. Those who wish to drive still can. It is about providing choice to Canadians. Forcing bikes to take side streets does not always work because it forces the cyclist to ride their bikes far out of the way of their destination and adds to travel time. It does not really allow it to be reliable alternative transport without access to safe and separated bike lanes on main roads.\nCanada has some of the worst traffic worldwide due to our inability to listen to repeated studies about road design and road safety in favour of a car dominated society. This is ironic as Canadians every year choose to vacation in some of the most walkable cities in the world due to their atmosphere and pedestrian and cycling friendly infrastructure (and yes, these are cities who previously adopted large-scale car infrastructure but have since changed their ways of moving around their cities in the last 60 years). It frustrates me that bills like this are preventing Canada from moving forward and progressing road safety like many countries and cities across the globe based on preconceived notions on what people believe fixes traffic (but increases it), over the information that we KNOW reduces traffic.\nThis feels like a huge overstep into municipal politics and is not in line with the studies we know to be true about traffic, cars usage, and road safety. Leave it to the municipalities to choose what they want in their own cities. This bill, by restricting the implementation of bike lanes, will cause an increase deaths of cyclists by cars across Ontario.\n"
