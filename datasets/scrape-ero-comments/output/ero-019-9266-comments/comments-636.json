        "comment": "Having lived through the OC Transpo strike of 2008, I know the best way to keep car traffic flowing is to provide lots of non-car options. Car traffic was very frustrating during the strike--it took forever to do errands that would normally have only taken 15-20 minutes because there were so many more cars on the road.\nWe are about a 10 minute bike ride from a major commercial center: there's a Shoppers and a grocery store.  A few more minutes and we can get to our closest library. Unfortunately, the major street between our house and this commercial area is not safe for bikes.  This meant my kids couldn't run an errand or go by themselves to the library until they could drive. A short bike lane, which is now in the planning stages, would have increased our children's independence and saved me time. I'm planning to run errands by bike as soon as the bike lane is in--keeping one more car off that busy stretch of road.\nMy son is finally learning to drive, and hopefully will soon be able to (barely) afford a car.  This will increase his job opportunities. Our church is helping settle a refugee family. They can't afford a car--but they might be able to afford a bike, which would increase the job options for the parents and older teens. For people who can't drive or don't have a car, a bike can be one more way to get to a job.  We need to reduce barriers to employment.\nProviding safe bike lanes reduces car traffic, saves parents time and reduces barriers to employment. It does not make sense to approve or squash bike lane changes at the provincial level. These are decisions that need to be made locally.\n"

This is a municipal issue that the Premier should have zero involvement in unless it's to provide funding for more of them.\nBike lanes are statiscally proven time and time again to REDUCE gridlock.\nIf bike lanes are reduced, it makes biking more dangerous for cyclists, drivers, and pedestrians; there are zero upsides other than appeasing a Premier obsessed with Toronto who likely has never taken a bike lane in his life. It also in no way reduces grid lock because those cyclists now need to board public transit, which would increase stops and potentially require additional buses and streetcars, or they have to get in cars. More cars on the road means more grid lock, something that should be obvious to this government but is ignored entirely, either out of sheer ignorance or willful malice.\nCycling is healthy, mentally and physically. It reduces environmental impact and saves tax payers money.\nThis entire idea is preposterous and a waste of our provincial government's time and valuable tax payer money. They should be embarrased at even having suggested it and knowing that people have to take time out of their days to fight their petty and personal vindictiveness.\nLEAVE THE BIKE LANES.\n"

        "comment": "Dear Ontario government,\nI live in downtown Toronto, and have done since I moved here in 1977. I own a car, use a bicycle frequently, and also use the TTC. I have worked, paid taxes, shopped, eaten in restaurants, enjoyed the parks, and I love living here.\nPlease don't take our bike lanes away. So many more people (including me!) now are biking, now that they feel safer. I can bike to work appointments far faster than either driving or TTC. It is a step in the right direction. Please keep on stepping into a healthier future, for the sake of your beautiful families and mine, for the sake of a healthier city, and healthier province, and world.\nThe problem of gridlock in Toronto is NOT solved by allowing more cars to enter and circulate downtown. It is NOT solved by building more, bigger, wider freeways. In fact study after study has shown that all that does is push the problem a couple more years down the road, and increase pollution-causing activity.\nIt is solved by improving public transit, improving fast rail around the Golden Horseshoe, making work from home, or from thriving satellite communities, easier. It would be better solved by building large parking areas at the ends of the transit system, and improving the train and bus service so people can zip downtown in minutes, instead of creating a gridlock for the rest of us, as they crawl toward downtown.\nWe cannot pretend that the population in Toronto, in Ontario, in Canada, and the whole world, hasn't doubled in the past few decades. We cannot go back to the sixties. We cannot ignore climate change. We cannot ignore the heat sink, and catastrophic flooding, created by burning fossil fuels in Toronto. We cannot ignore the continuing habitat destruction that is harming our food and clean air supplies. Covid sent people back into their cars for their privacy and health, but we are ready to come out now, if the transit was there to carry us safely and efficiently.\nWe cannot ignore that in fact 28% of Toronto households don't own a car, and need to get around by public transit or bicycle. That most people who work downtown on minimum or close to minimum wage cannot afford neither a car, nor to live downtown, so spend hours every day commuting by public transit. Taking bike lanes away doesn\u2019t help them. And redirecting the money it would cost to rip up already-built bike lanes would be better spent on transit for those people.\nMany cities in Europe have proven that a walking-friendly city becomes a thriving healthy city, one that is a pleasure to live and work and do recreational activities in. And a draw for international tourists. Not a smoggy dirty noisy place full of aggravated car drivers stuck in gridlock who are so frustrated and tired they are happy to run over you.\nPlease let Torontonians continue to work toward a healthy happy thriving city!\nWith respect and thanks for your well-meaning efforts.\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nI am an avid cyclist, having cycled from Midtown Toronto at Mountpleasant and Lawrence down to the CBC building, at Front and John, and back for 17 years, 9 months of the year. I always took the same route that NEVER involved cycling on a major street. All those years I felt quite safe on the roads. This was pre-current era bike lanes.\nThe bike lanes that have been planned and constructed in recent years are SO utterly confusing for both the cyclists and the vehicular drivers. I feel sorry for the drivers especially. There is just too much visual clutter for the average driver to take in and process. On top of that, the green bike lanes are slippery- who thought it was a good idea to paint the road so the surface offers no grip to the tires when wet.\nAs well, the reduction in lanes for cars/busses/ etc is just ridiculous. The traffic is at a stand still most of the time and the exhaust being emitted from cars sitting in gridlock can not in any way be countered by getting rid a couple of cars where their drivers have decided to take a bicycle.\nMy recommendation is that the culture surrounding cycling has to change first- people have to want to get on a bike and schlep themselves around! Then you can build the bike lanes, on routes that are actively being used by cyclists. The \"build it and they will come\" concept doesnt work in a city full of exhausted workers and parents rushing around trying to get their kids to school on time and then to work on time.\nSecondly- build bike lanes that make sense. Don't build just to virtue signal. The current bike lanes are such a poorly thought out solution to a problem that didn't exist in the first place.\n"

Drivers should be encouraged to make use of public transit.\nAlong the Bloor roadway, all the speed limits were reduced by 10kph. This reduction in speed also contributes to drive times.\nThe data that you Government keeps citing is data that predates COVID.

        "comment": "I am a Toronto resident who relies on bike lanes, including the Bloor street bike lane, on a daily basis to commute by bike with my young children to their daycare and then to my workplace to the downtown core. Commuting by bike all year round is my only viable option to cover the one-way 10-kilometer distance from my home in the west end, to the daycare (and eventually the school) of my children, and then to my work  (it is another 10 kilometers to do the reverse commute in the evening from my workplace, to the daycare and then home). My family cannot afford a car due to the high cost of car insurance in Ontario, of parking (at home and at work), and of car maintenance in addition to the up-front cost of purchasing a used car. The 10-kilometer one way distance of my daily commute would take between 1 hour 10 minutes and 1 hour 30 minutes by public transit by having to take a bus, then walk over 1 kilometer with my young children to their daycare, then walk nearly 1 kilometer to another bus to the subway station, take the subway for 7 stops and finally walk another 500 meters to my workplace. I can cover this distance in less than 40 minutes by bike. This proposed bill aimed at removing bike lanes in Toronto is a clear threat to the safety of my children, my safety, and my capacity to go to work. As a hard-working Toronto resident and Ontarian, I strongly opposed this ill-conceived proposed bill that is meant to make Toronto streets less safe and accessible for residents.\n"

        "comment": "I do not support this bill.  I am both a car and bicycle user and have an appreciation for the balance needed among modes of transportation.  To date in 2020 I've used a bicycle to travel more than 1,600 km for the purpose of commuting, and more than 5,500 when including leisure and fitness activities, most of which necessitate a significant amount of time in bike lanes.  The availability of bicycle lanes determines where folks can reasonably live.  With a housing crisis and without reliable transit, having safe active transportation options provides more choices for Ontarians.  Passing legislation which increases the time and capital required to implement more equitable means of transit across the province is not in the interest of all present and future Ontarians.\n"

Please keep our cities safe and continue your great work in public transit development. I support the governments efforts in building up our infrastructure and schools but this is a step too far and smells of government overreach, the communities around the bike lanes support them.

        "comment": "My first issue with Bill 212 is the exemptions being planned for Highway 413, specifically that it will be exempt from the Environmental Assessment Act. The impact of building this highway and further encouraging driving will have grave effects on the environment. This report from Environmental Defence highlights how Highway 413 would cause over 17 million tonnes of additional CO2 emissions by 2050 \u2013 the same date by which Canada is committed to reach net-zero emissions. The building of Highway 413 would pave over 400 acres of the Greenbelt, and over 2,000 acres of Class 1 and Class 2 farmland while harming over 29 species that are protected under the federal Species at Risk Act. We need to respect the process of evaluation and study the benefits and consequences of these decisions. We cannot ignore our environmental impact and how damaging the actions we take now will be to current and future generations.\nSecondly, bike lanes do not make gridlock worse. This is an incorrect statement that has been disproven. While the addition of new car lanes may initially reduce congestion, induced demand shows that it encourages more people who may not have otherwise chosen to drive. Adding car lanes is a short-term solution that further increases our dependence on cars and will make traffic worse for years to come. The same principle applies when proper biking infrastructure, such as dedicated bike lanes, are added. Bike Share Toronto has provided data that clearly shows the increased demand. In 2015 there were 665,000 bike trips made annually and grew to 5.7 million trips in 2023.\nThe Toronto Deputy Fire Chief, Jim Jessop, stated that emergency response times have improved since the installation of bike lanes. The Ontario Traffic Council and the Ontario Professional Planners Institute have both issued statements stating that removing bike lanes will not reduce congestion and put the public at increased risk. Why does this government not want to listen to experts on the matter at hand?\nIn particular, the bike lanes on University Avenue were championed by the CEOs of the hospitals to provide a safe means of travel for doctors, nurses, and hospital staff. Below are copies of the letters from the Sick Kids and Mount Sinai CEOs. The Mount Sinai CEO specifically notes that 63% of hospital staff bike to work.\nIt is not common sense to destroy infrastructure that is actively being used. The city of Toronto spent millions of dollars putting these lanes in and now the province wants to spend millions of dollars removing them while further causing the congestion they look to solve? How is that a good use of my, or anyone else's, tax dollars? A city of Toronto report is estimating the cost will be at least $48 million. That is not a very fiscally conservative use of taxpayer money.\nThis province has far greater needs than addressing congestion, which again this bill is doing nothing to address according to accredited experts in the field. We need doctors and substance abuse resources, we need housing, and we need to seriously focus on the environment and being ecologically sustainable for years to come. If this government truly cares about easing congestion in Toronto, why haven't they approved the cameras that Mayor Olivia Chow and police have asked for to more easily fine drivers for blocking the box? Surely, that would cost less than $48 million.\nBike lanes make our communities safer and they increase patronage at businesses. The results of the Bloor Street bike lane pilot stated that \"Total customer spending in the Bloor Street pilot area increased more than in the area surrounding the pilot and more than in the Danforth Avenue control area\" and that \"Motor vehicle travel times along Bloor Street initially increased immediately following the installation of the cycling facilities\". The usage of cars as a means of transportation is overly stated. This report about business and bike lanes on Bloor Street demonstrates that the majority of people are arriving at their businesses by foot or via public transit. Arriving by car is the least used form of transportation.\nFinally, Bill 212 includes a section stating that the government can \"take possession of certain land for priority of a highway project\" without providing compensation or offer affected parties the ability to apply for an adjustment of the date of possession for land under the Expropriations Act. This puts constituents at risk without any opportunity to pursue recourse and is not appropriate as owning property in Ontario has become a difficulty for many residents. The government is abusing their power and taking advantage of the public they are meant to serve.\nIt is reprehensible for the province to risk the overall ecological health of the province, the lives of cyclists and allow for the province to take citizen\u2019s land away from them to build a highway that will ultimately not reduce commutes. It's also shameful for the province to limit the opportunity for public comment on this issue. These are not the actions of work being performed in good faith.\n"
