There are more cyclists now than ever before and it is due to the bike lanes.\nMany people with mobility issues also use these and it gives them independence.\nOur milder conditions also mean that more of us are using lanes year round.\nOnce again our shouts for a greener city have no effect. Every rider is one less car.\nGood luck to the young  generation of Toronto. Smog, congestion and a few more ghost bikes in the future.\n"

        "comment": "I started cycle commuting to my work place in the last year. A big part of the confidence and safety I have been able to build as a newer cyclist has been due to the protected cycling routes along Bloor Street and University Avenue. I\u2019ve lived in the city my whole entire life and only at year 40 years of age did I feel comfortable enough to try this alternate mode of travel, due to the availability of safe cycling infrastructure. Cycling has proven to be fun, reliable and safer than I ever thought it could be. I have mostly been a  transit user and/or car user, but the transit system has been extremely unreliable service wise lately and driving in Toronto traffic is mostly unbearable. Cycling on safe connected protected routes truly provides an alternative to the chaos to get me from point A to B.\nFurther, all of the literature that I have come across has not linked bike lanes as a major contributor to traffic. In this specific case, it\u2019s my understanding that the majority of the Bloor Street and University Avenue bike lanes were curb lanes typically occupied by parked vehicles - therefore car traffic was not free flowing in that space previously so how is removal of these bike lanes going to reduce vehicular traffic ? It\u2019s illogical and irresponsible.\nBiking is an affordable travel mode, provides health and wellness benefits, and ultimately reduces the capacity issues on public transit or vehicular traffic on the roadway (people like myself who typically took transit or drove a car are biking instead of creating traffic in those modes). Bikeways provide a safe way for those who choose to cycle to arrive alive. It\u2019s a massive step backward to remove the connected cycling network that has been recently established and there will be more fatalities or serious injuries.\nThis bill also is a major overstep of municipalities being able to make decisions and plan the infrastructure in their right of way. It also does not align with planning policies currently in place and supported by the province - for example new residential developments (high density condominiums) typically have fewer parking spaces than units, which assumes that owners/tenants will be using non-car modes of travel. Overall, it\u2019s comical to me that this bill has been seriously proposed and is requiring unnecessary effort from municipal staff who have to respond and comment on it.\nToronto is a major city and while people (myself included) remember driving downtown without much issue, this is no longer realistic with how many people and density that has been established in recent years. Nobody drives into Manhattan or Paris or London anymore. Similar to these cities, Toronto doesn\u2019t have room to build more car lanes, so we need to be thinking about how the existing roadway can be balanced for all types of users in various modes; pedestrians, cyclists, transit and cars.\n"

        "comment": "The PC government in Ontario has done a fantastic job at removing red tape and bureaucracy - and getting great things done as a result. However, this is not that.\nFor highway 413, this bill removes essential safeguards that, if streamlined, should be streamlined for all projects, rather than opted out for some.\nFor bike lanes, this removes decision making power and authority from those who have the ability to take action, adding red tape, bureaucracy, and preventing Ontario from being a place to grow.\nOn bike lanes in particular, I support them because:\n* Bike infrastructure promotes fiscal responsibility on the local, provincial, and individual levels. For a given number of tax dollars spent on roads, many more people can ride on a bike lane than a car lane. This benefits me as a driver even if I don't use the bike lanes, because my taxes can be lower for the same services.\n* Bike infrastructure promotes individual responsibility, because bikes can quite easily be maintained by everyday people, and they are affordable to everyone - not only the rich.\n* Bike infrastructure gives individuals control and choices over their own health and exercise, allowing them to fit fitness into busy daily routines, promoting a healthy province, and reducing healthcare costs.\n* As a driver who hates driving in Toronto, sharing the road with bikes is super stressful! I want them to have their own lane, so that my commute can be more relaxing.\nHowever, all of that is besides the point - I'm against this bill because it's provincial overstepping on what should quite clearly be a municipal responsibility, adding red tape and bureaucracy, and making our province poorer with higher taxes.\nPlease reconsider the consequences of passing such a sweeping bill.\n"

Full stop.

Most places I visit are taking a different approach and encouraging bike use. For Toronto to lose its lanes is highly out of keeping with many priorities, such as encouraging more housing in the city and environmental objectives. It will also seriously erode the livability of the city, especially the downtown.\nThis proposal is also being roundly opposed by various expert bodies, as well as bodies such as BIAs.\nThis proposal is a devastating blow to Toronto and really must not proceed.\nThank you\n"

If we really care about traffic and congestion, we should be embracing well-designed bike lanes as a way to improve traffic flow. Studies have validated the fact that bike lanes do not contribute to increased traffic.\nI am both a cyclist and a driver. I bike when I can, but if I have to drive I much prefer driving on roads with separated bike lanes. Why? Because I don't have to share the same lane as a cyclist and worry that I might accidentally hit them. Bike lanes improve the experience for everyone - both cyclists and drivers benefit when safety is prioritized.\nThis proposed bill is absolute nonsense. Bike lanes should be preserved, not removed at municipalities' expense. The province needs to stay in their lane and leave decisions about cycling infrastructure to the cities where it belongs.\n"

        "comment": "I am very disappointed in this bill and all that it stands for. It would be a giant step backwards for the province in every way that it proposes to address gridlock.\nFirst of all, the removal of protections for homeowners from expropriation is an flagrant attack on individual rights and due process. This alone should make this bill very problematic to every resident of the province. The removal of environmental assessment requirements for major infrastructural projects is similarly backwards - the long term consequences of a lack of environmental protections can impact many generations and it's a lesson that's well understood by people who cherish this land. We should not and cannot just throw that aside for short term, controversial, political ambitions.\nSecondly, the issue of where to put bike lanes should be determined by local democratic processes, and it is a gross overreach of the provincial government to interfere with such matters where they have no expertise. The division of responsibilities of different levels of government should be respected, and I have not heard any compelling argument in the form of studies or public consultations that would indicate that this would actually address gridlock. In fact, if every cyclist in a municipality were forced to drive instead there is every reason to believe that gridlock would worsen, not improve.\nMost importantly of all, so much research has gone into the best ways for communities to build resilience and prepare for the challenges of climate change, and this bill goes against everything we should be standing for. Instead of investing in the future, the bill seems to chain us ever more tightly to a automobile-dependent past that is simply unsustainable. This is grossly short-sighted.\nAddressing gridlock may be an important priority for the government, but it should not be at the expense of our individual rights, environmental protections, and local democracy. We must come up with better solutions that safeguard our well-being and our future.\n"

        "comment": "I am extremely displeased with this proposal for numerous reasons. If the objective of this act, is to \"fight gridlock and get drivers where they need to go faster,\" as stated, then the proposed legislation is going about it all wrong.\nFirst of all, bikes are traffic. Even though this act does not include them in its consideration as \"drivers\" and \"traffic\", nonetheless, bikes are vehicles on the road. That means traffic. Providing bike lanes then removes them from the flow of car traffic. Not only does this increase safety for cyclists and reduce the potential hazards for cars of mixed traffic, but also it removes slower traffic from car lanes. Without separate bike lanes, where else can bikes go but in the regular lanes of traffic? By removing bike lanes, traffic will actually slow down on roads by forcing bikes and cars together. Bikes will not suddenly disappear from streets because there are no bike lanes. Thousands of people commute and get around Toronto by bicycle every day. They will continue to do so, with or without bike lanes.\nUnless, however, the thought is that by removing bike lanes, cyclists will then be forced off main roads because they are unsafe. I would be appalled to think that this act would hope to decrease the safety of our streets for all road users. That would be a dangerous precedent to set about who is given priority and consideration in this province. That only those that can afford a car, or afford to take a taxi or ride-share, are the ones that merit consideration in the use of the publicly funded roads.\nSecondly, there are plenty of studies from municipalities all over the world that demonstrate that bike lanes actually reduce gridlock and increase the overall flow of traffic. Despite the current governments thoughts to the contrary, increasing lanes will only increase traffic. It happens everywhere. Induced demand will only cause traffic to get back to the stand still it is currently in. Bike lanes are not the problem. Too many cars and limited other options for road users are the joint problems. Increased funding for other options, like bike lanes, but also transit, then eases demand on roads by spreading out the ways that people use them, thereby increasing the overall flow of traffic.\nFurther to this point, a large part of the gridlock problem at the moment is due to construction. There is construction everywhere in the city. It is unavoidable. It seems impossible to suggest that removing bike lanes will solve the gridlock by plunging the city into further long stretches of construction along major thoroughfares.\nThirdly, the bike lanes in Toronto are already installed and paid for. The city has already spent $27 million of taxpayer money to install them. Many consultations and studies were done before installing these bikes lanes. It is not now the provinces job to turn around because they disagree with what the city decided to do. This is a municipal decision. To then take $48 million dollars more of provincial taxpayer money to change something that only effects one city is a gross misuse of public funds. Toronto's bike lanes were paid for by Toronto. It is not the rest of the tax-paying citizens of Ontario's responsibility to pay to do something that will only effect Toronto.\nNot only is not the province's duty and a misuse of funds, but it is financially irresponsible when there is so much else that $48 million could be used for. That money could fund new family physicians that are so desperately needed in the province, or fund transit, or housing, or any number of real provincial priorities.\nAll this is to say that I strongly disapprove of this bill. As a citizen of Toronto, as a car-owning driver, as a cyclist, as someone that generally cares about smart policy decisions, I firmly believe this is a miss-step that can only be looked upon as a selfish ploy to appeal to a subset of the population, rather than a real decision based in the public good.\nPlease keep the bike lanes. Let us build forward together, province and city together, rather than plunging the city backwards at great cost for little-to-no-gain.\n"

Countries and cities that have bike lanes are held up as examples where people have a higher quality of life. Planners can work to make bike lanes less intrusive on cars. For instance, they can consider making some streets dedicated to bike traffic and some streets dedicated to foot traffic. Given the importance of cycling in a city as dense as Toronto, it seems foolish to remove bike lanes or discourage bike lanes. Why not work to make cyclist better equipped to be part of the traffic system by regulating and licensing them?\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my deep concerns about Bill 212, which, if enacted, would require municipalities to seek provincial approval for adding new bike lanes that involve removing existing car lanes. While I understand the importance of maintaining traffic flow and addressing congestion, this legislation risks undermining the safety, environmental sustainability, and economic vibrancy of our communities.\nBike Lanes Save Lives\nStudies consistently show that bike lanes reduce traffic-related fatalities and injuries for both cyclists and motorists. A 2019 study published in The Journal of Transport and Health found that cities with more bike lanes experienced lower rates of traffic fatalities overall, as they encourage safer driver behavior and provide dedicated spaces for cyclists. Moreover, data from New York City revealed a 40% reduction in fatalities on streets with protected bike lanes.\nBy restricting the ability of cities to expand cycling infrastructure, Bill 212 could inadvertently increase risks for vulnerable road users, especially as cycling grows in popularity as a mode of transportation.\nBike Lanes Do Not Cause Congestion\nThe argument that bike lanes lead to increased traffic congestion is not supported by research. A 2021 study from McGill University showed that bike lanes, especially those separated from car traffic, can improve overall traffic flow by reducing conflict points between vehicles and cyclists. Similarly, cities like Copenhagen and Amsterdam, which prioritize cycling infrastructure, report less congestion compared to car-dominated urban areas.\nInstead of framing the issue as \u201ccars versus bikes,\u201d we should focus on building transportation systems that work for everyone. By providing safe and efficient options for all modes of travel\u2014whether driving, cycling, or walking\u2014we can foster a more connected and functional urban environment.\nInvesting in Better Cities\nBike lanes are not just about transportation; they contribute to healthier, more sustainable communities. Studies have shown that areas with robust cycling infrastructure see increased economic activity, as cyclists tend to stop more frequently at local businesses compared to car drivers. Additionally, encouraging active transportation reduces greenhouse gas emissions, supports public health, and alleviates financial burdens on families who might otherwise depend on multiple vehicles.\nRestricting bike lane development may hinder progress toward these goals, especially in cities with growing populations and diverse transportation needs. We should empower municipalities to make the decisions that best suit their local contexts, rather than impose blanket policies that may stifle innovation and progress.\nA Collaborative Solution\nI urge you to reconsider the provisions of Bill 212 that limit municipal autonomy and the expansion of active transportation options. Instead, we should focus on policies that encourage collaboration between the province and cities to build safer, greener, and more economically resilient communities.\n"
