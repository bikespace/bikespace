The only long term solution is to make it easier to travel without a car.\nRemoving bike lanes is a step backwards.\nThe province should be investing more in LRT, bike lanes, subways, if they want to make a meaningful impact on traffic.\n"

        "comment": "Absolutely nuts. This city is in a gridlock with cars and you try to dismantle one thing that could resolve the problem? Cycles take up less space, churn out less greenhouse emission (none if a manual bike), and is faster than cars and transit in Toronto!!! We are finally heading in the right direction of encouraging cycling in the motor centric city and the Ontario provincial government is trying to reverse the hard won progress! Cycling lanes and cycling are the future of this city, we do not want to regress into being stuck in traffic or pedestrians/cyclists being hit by cars\n"

        "comment": "I disagree with the intention of this bill. Toronto as a municipality should be the only one that takes decisions on what bike lanes it needs without the intervention of the Province. The existing bike lanes have been set up with consultation from the public, meaning from the neighbours and if they decide that a bike lane is not working for them, it is their prerogative to take it to the City. The environment impact of adding highways and cars to the existing grid lock needs to be taken into account. Remember congestion is caused by cars, not by bikes.\n"

There is an overwhelming consensus from studies around the world that more bike lanes reduces congestion, reduces costs and leads to cleaner air and happier people. Reverse coarse on this ill informed bill and leave these decisions to municipalities where theu belong.\n"

        "comment": "Why would we spend our tax dollars to remove recently installed bike lanes that keep our cyclists safe (including many children who use them to get to school). I am a GTA resident who also drives and it is so much better to have physical separation between cars and bicycles (and cyclists have just as much of a right to use main streets as motorists since main streets have more destinations).\nThe proposed legislation is a disgrace and there is no reason that the provincial government should be interfering in municipal issues to this extent (even if they have the power to do so). Whatever happened to small government?\n"

        "comment": "I am strongly against this proposal. The removal of bike lanes in key streets will only encourage more cars on the road, creating even more congestion throughout all hours of the day.\nInstead, the province should focus their efforts on bettering the public transport infrastructure such as the rapid completion of the Eglinton crosstown LRT.\n"

        "comment": "My boyfriend is going to the protest of this bill today, and on his way, he saw a biker get hit by a cement truck. This was on Shaw and Bloor street. The intersection did not have any bike lanes.\nBecause cement trucks have low visibility, it couldn't see the biker when making it's turn. This horrible situation is what makes me afraid to use my bike in the city of Toronto.\nBy enacting this bill, you are actively putting citizens who cannot afford, don't have a license, or simply choose not to use vehicle transport, in serious danger. People die from the lack of bike lane infrastructure everyday.\nThis is not the future of our planet or society. Be better.\n"

We need more bike Lanes and more public transit and fewer cars with a singular driver in them.\n"
