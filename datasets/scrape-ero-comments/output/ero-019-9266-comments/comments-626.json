I fear the premier is himself a driver who believes the roads belong to drivers. After over a century of governments pandering to motorists, look where that's got us. How many  cyclists and pedestrians have been killed or maimed by motorists, versus how many motorists have been killed or maimed by cyclists or pedestrians? The cars are winning the war on cars!  What are you going to do about that, Ontario? The province should support Toronto's Vision Zero, not seek to undermine it.\n"

        "comment": "As a downtown resident who both cycles regularly and drives, I believe the removal of bike lanes along Bloor, Yonge, and University streets would be devastating for our local community. Not only would it exponentially increase the already high risk of cycling downtown, I don't believe it would actually reduce or improve traffic, it would only encourage more cars. Having and maintaining the bike lanes encourages people to cycle which absolutely REDUCES traffic.\nI know that I wouldn't frequent nearly the number of businesses along Bloor if I didn't feel safe cycling there. Because I can do so in a fraction of the time compared to driving. And it's also free. We shouldn't be accommodating the surrounding GTA when they're the not ones who live here day to day. We have alternative transit options with the GO train and TTC. Though I could also argue that removing parking along Bloor St could help with congestion more than removing the bike lane.\nPlease make the responsible decision for our downtown residents and our safety. Implementing more bike lanes will only increase our visibility, ultimately making it safer for us and encouraging safer driving practices. Hopefully at which point we can see an even greater increase in our local cycling community.\nThank you for your time!\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes is shortsighted and is just political pandering. We need to diversify the way we get around especially within the downtowns of our cities. There is no future in which we can grow our population and grow car usage at the same rate. We need to be encouraging car pooling, building transit, and improving connectivity of bike lanes. While I agree that future lanes should prioritize less busy streets I think spending money to rip out infrastructure we just spent millions on is idiotic - especially because it will barely improve drive times. Wasteful politicking.\n"

        "comment": "Regarding Highways:\nInduced demand has historically negated any benefits from highway expansions within 13-18 months in Ontario. The funds would be better spent on well-designed transit projects, preferably elevated and high-speed transit. Elevated transit, ideally consisting of inverted trains, would allow the area above the track to be used for wind and solar energy capture. This design also better protects the concrete from the elements, reducing issues like those seen with the Gardiner Expressway.\nMoreover, elevated trains can double up on roads without affecting traffic. High-speed rail can more easily navigate the lack of acceptable corridors for true 250 km/h+ rail. Both high-speed and local elevated transit should offer local, local express, and express modes with well-coordinated timetables to encourage people to leave their cars and enjoy their commute by reading a book or relaxing.\nRegarding Bike Lanes:\nProperly designed bike lanes are not just a transit concern; they are public safety infrastructure. For example, the bike lanes on Adelaide and Richmond in Toronto provide transport for an additional 400 people per rush hour, compared to only about 80 for an additional car lane due to exit ramps. Additionally, ambulances and other emergency services use the current infrastructure to bypass cars that cannot move out of the way during emergencies. Lives will be lost if these lanes are removed. Rescue equipment will be blocked, and fire engines will be unnecessarily deployed and stuck when a faster supervisor vehicle could access the site if an engine is not needed.\nMunicipalities should build infrastructure for their own citizens and know best where to place it without provincial bureaucratic overhead. Providing funds for public safety and transit infrastructure will allow people to travel without the stress and hardships of driving, improving the quality of life for everyone. Those who still drive will benefit from reduced traffic if the money is invested in public safety and transit infrastructure.\nOverall Impact of the Bill:\nThis bill, in its current form, only guarantees more gridlock, reduces mobility, and will create enclaves where people are locked into their neighbourhoods.\n"

        "comment": "Safe, connected and extensive bike lanes are key to increasing ridership especially in up to max 5 - 7km trip length. Trip studies show that a large portion of vehicle trips in the city are in this range. It is especially critical to increase ridership by young people to get more people out of cars for trips that can be completed easily by alternate forms of transportation. Bike lanes are the only safe way to get our kids and young people riding. I have also seen a lot of elderly people  with shopping baskets on their bikes on the bloor bike lanes. Seniors often can't drive and cycling is a viable alternative for many but they are another vulnerable population that needs protected bike lanes. in addition not everyone can afford a car. Cycling is a preferred way to get around the city and people really should try it before they denounce it. Our family like to ride because it is so convenient. Saves time, provides exercise, parking readily available, easy to make many stops to shop, ability to connect with people you pass, environmentally friendly. The number one reason people tell us they won't ride is because they don't think it is safe. We should try to encourage cycling by adding to the existing cycling network and improving the safety of cycling. Leave the car lanes for people on longer trips, mobility challenges, delivery vehicles or service people who travel between clients etc. If you haven't tried getting somewhere on the bike lanes yourselves or talked to friends or family who use them, you need to before you make the grave mistake of reducing the cycle network in the city.\n"

Regarding the removal of existing bike lanes, while I believe we should tweak our lanes over time to work toward a solution that works for all modes of transportation, it shouldn't be done in haste, and particularly shouldn't be done while so many routes are hindered by existing construction projects. If over time it is determined that some lanes should be removed, let it be done at a time and in a manner that is minimally disruptive and costly.\n"

        "comment": "I do not believe that taking out bike lanes is in the interests of citizens living in Toronto. I have lived in Toronto all my life and have always used my bicycle to get around. I have seen many changes over 4 decades. In the last few years, there are more cyclists of all kinds on the roads including couriers and those of us who use the bicycle as our primary vehicle in the city. Without bike lanes, it would not be safe for me to cycle on downtown streets.\nBy using my bicycle I can move around the city in a quick and inexpensive fashion while also staying healthy with the exercise I get. The last thing I want is to be forced into my car in what will undeniably be gridlock in an ever more densely populated city. The increase in bicycles and other vehicles makes it essential to have bike lanes that protect our safety as cyclists and make it possible to keep cycling. The environmental benefits are self evident. We know that more cyclists means fewer cars on the road.\nI absolutely do not want to see my elected representatives spending their time and our money undoing progressive building projects such as bike lanes! It doesn't make sense for those of us who live here.  Please put your energy into something that is more useful and enterprising. Around the world, the best run cities do have bicycle lanes that benefit their citizens, the environment and the quality of life there. Toronto is moving in the right direction already and I am shocked that there would be a suggestion of going backward. I appreciate the chance to express my opinion as someone who lives here and uses the infrastructure here every day. I hope you will consider my experience and thoughts carefully.\n"

We don't own a car, as we never saw the need living in Toronto and I think that this decision benefits our neighbours--one less car to park as most of the people who live on my street use on-street parking.\nI am writing to express my concern with removing bike lanes, in particular the Bloor Street bike lanes for many reasons, but these are the main ones: (1) independence for my kids, and (2) Safety. The bloor bike lanes automatically made my kids more independent. Both my kids started biking on their own to reach destinations on Bloor Street--school especially--once the bike lanes opened. They are smart cyclists, but the bike lane gave them more confidence to get around the city on their own. (2) Safety is of course the biggest issue. Bloor Street especially has many businesses with people getting on and off their bicycles to do shopping. Take those lanes away and everyone will be mixing in traffic. I am not opposed to that, but if the goal is to get people moving, mixing cyclists and cars will most definitely slow down traffic, there will be no choice. Plus, we have seen a huge rise in food delivery workers on electric bikes, and people on electric bikes more generally. Mixing all those people in two lanes of traffic is a recipe for chaos.\nKeeping them separated is the smart and safe thing to do.\n"

This bill will also have a cost for municipalities that already have plans in place for improving their active transportation networks but will now require approval from the provincial government going forward.\nThis bill will increase the size and cost of of the Ontario government due to having to approve plans for improving transportation options in cities and towns from Windsor to London to Kitchener to Newmarket to Kingston to Ajax to Barrie to Sudbury to Thunder Bay. All of this seemly because someone driving an oversized single occupant vehicle from Etobicoke to Queen's Park gets frustrated dealing with traffic.\nLimiting and removing bike lanes limits and removes options and choices for transportation in urban areas. This limiting of options will likely lead to more people deciding to drive instead of using a bike or other means of active transportation which will likely increase the traffic congestion this bill is trying to decrease.\nInstead of directing so many resources on removing options for transportation this government should be looking at ways to increase options. The focus should be on improving public transportation options, improving safety and building active transportation networks that will encourage people to use a means of transportation that is different than a single occupancy vehicle.\nThis bill is short-sighted, will limit options for people looking to help reduce traffic congestion and will increase red tape for municipalities that are working on making their communities more livable. I would like to see this government show strong leadership by removing the requirement for provincial approval for bike lanes from this bill.\n"

BUT! They also save lives. My husband is one of thousands of cyclists that use bike lanes in this city to get to work (and we live 25 kms away in Mississauga from where he works downtown). We have neighbours and friends who also use them to commute from our neighbourhood, one of whom was hit by an aggressive driver last year who HIT HER INTENTIONALLY.\nEVERYDAY my husband passes families and people with children biking their kids to school in the morning. This could not be possible without bike lanes.\u00a0Yes, I know it slows down drivers.... but is saving 5-10 mins on a commute worth putting cyclists at risk? Remember, cyclists are husbands, mothers, friends, family, children.\nKeep in mind that DINE TO still has their patios out into the street. This doesn't get affected. So the priority is drivers and outdoor dining... and then cyclists. Just saying.....\nBiking is a more affordable way of transportation and better for the environment. I understand it's not everyone's way of being, but in an economy where everything continues to get more and more expensive, it is an affordable option. \u00a0 CYCLISTS also deserve the space they need to and from where they are going.\nWhy along Bloor? There is NO OTHER way. It's the only direct way that goes across the Humber River.\nFurthermore, we need to have MUCH tougher laws for aggressive drivers who INTENTIONALLY put cyclists at risk.\u00a0 We see it, we know it happens and drivers feel incredibly entitled as if cyclists are less than human. Stiffer fines, better education for drivers who seem to have no idea what the actual laws are.\nTHANK YOU!\n"

Reduced car dependency also benefits drivers by alleviating congestion.\nOn the Overall Impact of the Bill:\nAs it stands, this bill would lead to increased gridlock, hinder mobility, and create isolated neighbourhoods where residents face limited travel options. A more forward-thinking approach is necessary to ensure Ontario's transportation network supports growth, accessibility, and sustainability.\n"

        "comment": "I am a driver, a homeowner and a person who rides a bike.   I preferentially bike year-round, to work, to shop, to run errands and for entertainment. I rarely take my car, even though I live in a suburban area. The implementation of complete streets in my city means it is becoming safer for everyone to move around, pedestrians, drivers and people who ride bikes.  My children, my husband, I and our community are all much safer with the implementation of bikes lanes.\nI am deeply disappointed by the reactive and regressive proposed Bill 212.  With increasing population density, we can no longer rely on single occupancy motor vehicles to move folks around their neighbourhoods, the city and the province.  It is imperative that decisions are made on evidence, not anecdotes or personal opinions.\nInduced demand, or \u201cthe fundamental law of highway congestion\u201d is confirmed by evidence going back to the 1960s. The concept also applies to a ton of other things, like public transportation and bike lanes \u2014 when you give people more of something or make it easy to access, they tend to use it more.  Let\u2019s have public discussion about tackling congestion that rely on the facts, not outdated ideas that can be disproven.\nCycling is a non-partisan issue, and improved infrastructure is imperative for a healthy, vibrant and safe community for all road users.  Drawing complete streets and cycling infrastructure into a culture war is wrong and short-sighted.   Please think beyond the next election cycle and help support long term sustainable growth for our community. Mobility behaviour is associated with orientation towards the common good, and cycling, rather than driving is positively associated with orientation towards the common good.  Please consider the impact of our decisions on future generations.  Decisions we make today should result in a sustainable world for the next seventh generation.\nThe majority of Ontarians are cyclists, and they want to cycle more often, given the numerous benefits cycling brings in terms of healthy, safe and active communities. In addition, the fact that the data shows that Ontarians are both motorists and cyclists. With Ontario motorists also cycling regularly there is a clear imperative that we all focus on making our roads and our communities safer with investments that will save lives \u2013 and lessen congestion.\nBike lanes are increasingly being recognized for their potential benefits to communities, including promoting physical activity, improving safety, and supporting local economies. There are a number of varied, positive impacts of bike lanes based on multiple research studies.\nA study out of Simon Fraser University, in Burnaby, B.C., examined the health-related cost-benefit ratios of planned cycling infrastructure investments between 2016 and 2020 in three Canadian cities. In all three cases the researchers found that the dollar value of health-related benefits exceeded the cost of planned infrastructure investments.\nBike lanes lead to a significant increase in the number of cyclists, promoting physical activity and healthier lifestyles\nBike lanes can have neutral to positive economic impacts on local businesses, with increased customer spending and foot traffic observed in areas where bike lanes replaced on-street parking.\nBike lanes support sustainable transportation by encouraging cycling over car use, which can reduce traffic congestion and lower carbon emissions\nBike lanes offer numerous benefits to communities, including increased physical activity, improved safety, economic gains, and environmental advantages.\nSuccessful implementation of bike lanes requires community engagement and addressing concerns such as 'bikelash'\u2014opposition to bike lanes. This is already happening with multiple town halls, clear, transparent reporting from city planning departments and ongoing adjustments to complete streets based on community feedback and data.   Effective planning and coalition-building are essential for overcoming resistance and aligning with community needs.\nI request that the Province work collaboratively with cities to address congestion and road safety and accordingly withdraw the proposed amendments to Part XII of the Highway Traffic Act contained in Bill 212.  Together we can tackle some of the biggest, messiest problems that we face as a society.  Thank you.\n"
