Consider those who are too young to drive, or who have yet to get a license, or perhaps people without the income to afford a car.\nThe bill states that \"Implications to the environment will be considered\", but does not consider the massive difference in impact between moving a car and a bicycle the same distance. When is the last time a bicycle failed an emissions test? The carbon emissions from driving a car have had a tremendous impact on the environment... but the carbon emissions from riding a bicycle is just your own breathing.\nAlongside this, requiring provincial approval for reducing motor vehicle lanes is absurd. There have been many studies showing that more lanes do not lessen traffic long-term, due to a phenomenon called Induced Demand.\nRemoving the existing Bicycle Lane infrastructure as listed is also nonsensical. Tax dollars have already been spent to set them up, and they are actively in use. To remove these lanes would incur unnecessary construction time and add further temporary congestion on the roads, directly going against the stated reasoning of this illogical bill, and furthermore reducing public mobility options within the City with no real reason.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is foolish and shortsighted.  A greater variety of transportation options will allow for maximum mobility across all of Ontario.  The main thing blocking the roads is an excessive number of cars.  Instead institute policies to actively encourage the use of public transit, carpooling, ride sharing, active transportation including cycling and walking, as well as wheelchairs and micromobility devices, and institute policies actively discouraging the single occupant in a car situations which are all too common, and you will get much greater throughput on all transportation routes.  Bicycles, wheelchairs and other non-car, personal scale vehicles can use bike paths in other jurisdictions in Europe, Asia, and elsewhere depending on local regulations.  Dictating the removal of bike lanes undermines local control and the autonomy of citizens.  Not everyone is able to drive, including children under the age of 16, people with various medical issues, or various other reasons, but a lot of those in such situations can use bicycles to get around, and having quality cycling networks in place can help them be fully part of society.  Bloor, Yonge, and other streets were choked with car traffic before any bike lanes were installed, and in other jurisdictions, where bike lanes were removed, the traffic was still choked, because cars take up a massive amount of road space relative to the number of people transported by them.\n"

To destroy the biking along Yonge, Bloor, and University would be a massive waste of taxpayer dollars, as well as a signal that the government has contempt for the environment and the safety of Torontonian cyclists.

There is significant literature and information on the need for cities/urban areas to embrace multi-modal systems for transportation. This bill proposes to continue car dependency, contrary to the recommendations of experts in urban planning, active transportation and safety. It is unfortunate that the Ontario government is not acting on behalf of the majority of Ontario residents, instead focusing on manufacturing a culture-war that benefits no one.\n"

        "comment": "I am a Torontonian who both takes the car and subway for commutes in and across the city, and I enjoy biking recreationally, but lack the infrastructure around my area to feel comfortable or safe being able to do so, even for short trips.\nI think the proposal to remove some of the few safe and long bike routes in this city while making new ones much more difficult to build is both shortsighted, and undermines it's own purpose in the long term by restricting the potential for future urban developments that could make this city more safe, efficient, and freely traversable.\nI also believe that to push a proposal to remove bike lanes by laser focusing on the areas they are perceived to have the most negative effect, and then pointing to total usage statistics across a city where, as a whole, bike infrastructure is sparse, inconsistent, and incomplete, is disingenuous at best.\nThe idea that few Torontonians will be negatively affected by the removal of the bike lanes both minimizes the still impressive number of people who do still consistently commute by bike lane despite the lack of bike lane coverage, and entirely dismisses the concept that ridership is proportional to the perceived safety and convenience of biking in the first place.\nBike infrastructure takes up far less space than car infrastructure does, and can accommodate far more commuters at one time in any given space. Every person that could drive but decides it would be more safe and convenient to bike there instead would dramatically reduce traffic, free up exponentially more space for the people who need to drive, save bike commuters money in car maintenance and gas, save drivers money by reducing traffic, save taxpayer dollars in road maintenance, promote local businesses by making them more accessible than just to the few people who can park their cars near it, improve their physical and mental health, and literally save lives.\nSo I struggle to understand why with so little actual bike lane coverage in this city, that destroying what there is would have much of a benefit for commuters at all. I personally think that this bill focuses too closely on such a small factor that affects traffic, while doing little to nothing to actually address the larger urban design and traffic issues that affect far more than just the three routes with bike lanes named in this bill.\nI believe our urban planners and designers could use the time they would need to spend reviewing every single bike lane in this city more productively in researching and creating more effective proposals for addressing the greater commuting issues that affect this city.\nI believe that the short term effects of tearing up the current bike infrastructure in this city will be just as negative to both car and bike commuters as it is supposed to be positive, while being just as likely to receive identical amounts of complaints about construction and lane reductions in this city than the construction of new bike lanes often is.\nAnd finally, I believe that the current state of bike infrastructure in this city needs more support, not less. People choosing to use alternatives to cars for their commutes aren't obstacles in the way of those who choose not to or cannot, and is a destructive solution to a complex situation that will only further to discourage the large statistical population of Torontonians who believe they could or even wish they could commute using a bike, but lack the necessary infrastructure to do so safely and efficiently.\nPermanently bottlenecking future urban developments in Toronto that could forever shape the city for the better in the long term is, in my honest opinion, a shortsighted idea that will turn back the clock of progress in this city for far more than just commuters, forever.\n"

Bike lanes are crucial for reducing traffic congestion and encouraging more people to choose cycling as a viable commuting option. Eliminating these lanes would not only hinder progress towards a greener city but also compromise safety for cyclists and pedestrians alike. We should be investing in infrastructure that promotes diverse modes of transportation, not dismantling it.\n"

        "comment": "As a lifelong resident of Toronto who has lived all over the city (including the area where Doug Ford resides), I find it completely ridiculous to remove bike lanes on primary routes. I personally witness countless people using these lanes daily, myself included. The removal or relocation of these lanes will not only increase city traffic but also create hazardous conditions for cyclists, pedestrians, and drivers alike.\nLet\u2019s look at the facts: since the introduction of protected bike lanes on routes like Bloor, cycling in Toronto has increased by 36% in certain areas, and the number of vehicle-cyclist collisions has decreased significantly. These lanes are critical for reducing congestion as they offer a safe, efficient alternative to driving and allow for more people to travel through high-traffic areas without adding to car volume.\nFurthermore, many of the stats reported by the government against cycling infrastructure are either inaccurate or misleading, with some citing incomplete routes, such as Eglinton Avenue, which is still under construction. Using such skewed data as justification for removing bike lanes, along with the premier\u2019s personal anecdotal evidence on his morning commute in his SUV, is not only disingenuous but fails to acknowledge the proven benefits of completed bike corridors across Toronto.\nStudies from cities worldwide confirm that dedicated cycling infrastructure improves traffic flow and reduces commute times. Toronto, with its already high volume of commuters, benefits immensely from this. Removing bike lanes from major arteries is a regressive move that ignores modern urban planning and environmental priorities, while costing taxpayers more in traffic, accidents, and pollution.\nWith the climate crisis and an increased demand for sustainable, active transportation, dismantling these bike lanes is a move backward. It disregards Toronto\u2019s commitment to reducing emissions and meeting sustainability goals. We need better cycling infrastructure, not less, and dismantling it ignores the needs and safety of thousands who rely on these routes.\nI personally knew a woman whose sister passed away after being struck by a driver; she was not on a bike path, and if she had been, this tragedy might have been prevented. Safe, dedicated infrastructure saves lives. Removing these lanes puts lives at risk and undermines the vision of a safer, more accessible Toronto for all. People who bike down these routes will continue too and it will just cause more congestion as well as more fatalities.\nAs person who loves the city of Toronto, I kindly ask you to reconsider.\n"
