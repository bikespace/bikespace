        "comment": "This legislation is addressing issues that are beyond the purview of the provincial government. Duly elected local governments have reviewed their roads and determined the best location for bike lanes to improve the safety of their citizens and increase the number of people using connected bike lanes. I note that none of the provincial considerations acknowledge the danger to cyclists who have to ride alongside motorists when no dedicated bike lanes are available. Also decisions such as removing or preventing bike lanes should be based on research not just what a group of people think. The yet to be developed criteria is another area of concern. Criteria can be skewed to achieve certain political goals always favoring cars over bikes. Consideration should be given for all citizens not just those driving cars.\n"

        "comment": "Notwithstanding the oxymoronic title for the bill, this amendment will do little to reduce traffic gridlock in the downtown core of the City of Toronto. The three streets mentioned in the proposal contain many pedestrians relying on bicycles to get throughout the city and removing them will only cause further issues in the future, not only from a pedestrian standpoint, but automotive as well. Furthermore, having to rely on the provincial government to acquire approval to install any other bike lanes in spite of the fact many of these zoning proposals have been done at the municipal level through city council creates an imbalanced playing field for any initiative to improve infrastructure within the City of Toronto and can be perceived as a borderline abuse of authority.\n"

Bicycles are more efficient than cars for short trips, and bike lanes are needed for people to be able to comfortably use bicycles.\n\"Removing Car Lanes\"  Is a status quo bias, and we should look at the best transportation network, regardless of what the current network we have is.\nStudies have shown time and time again that the only way to prevent congestion is to provide alternatives to personal vehicle traffic.\nIf bike lanes are currently underused, studies show that is probably because they have not been around long enough for people to get used to them, and/or they are not connected to where people want to go, so we need to build a bigger network.\nThe Premier and Transportation Secretary should use Transit to get to work, and work on making the transportation network better for everyone, not adding car infrastructure to make it worse for everyone, including cars.\n"

        "comment": "I live in toronto and I usually lean more conservative but it's ridiculous to rip out the bike lanes we already have on university and floor. Those are essential central routes on setting up proper bike infrastructure for the city. Rather we should focus on existing routes and Making them safe and space efficient. For example our tree planters could be part of the barrier for the bike lanes at appropriate size instead of between side walk and bike lane. Often these tree/ planter or art installations are the same size as a the bike lane and are put between them and size walk which is causing road congestion. Rather planter and art sizes can be limited placed on road facing size separating bike lanes from roads, allowing us to free up road space whole keeping bike lanes. Further more on some street where lanes on either side are too big for road, we could have bikelanes going opposite directions placed on same side of the street, which prevents having to create 2 barriers on both sides of the road. Lastly the existing bike routes should be connected to more areas of the city.\n"

        "comment": "There is no reason to believe that Provincial government should be involved in decisions that should be made at the city level, especially with the installation or removal of bike lanes. I use these bike lanes often to commute to work, and by doing so I'm reducing the number of cars on those roads. I've been riding along Bloor for 30 years, and it's only since the bike lanes have been put in that I feel safe to ride. It's not perfect - there is still constant construction along the Danforth/Bloor corridor that adds congestion. Honestly, it's this construction that slows down traffic more than the lack of a second lane.\nThe suggestion to move the bike lanes to side streets is asinine and will lead to more injuries - side streets have so many 4-way stops that would make riding impractical. If you don't have safe bike lanes then people are less likely cycle, or will try anyways and get hurt. In this case you're prioritizing profit over lives, and that is extremely short sighted. I also drive to work and when I do realize that it's going to take time, and in no way do I blame that on the bikes.\nStay in your lane. Focus on provincial issues like highways and leave the details of the GTA to the people we elected to deal with the issues and know them best.\n"

        "comment": "I am a student at the University of Toronto, and I use the Bloor bike lanes every day to get to school. I am appalled that the government of Ontario is considering ripping out these vital pieces of infrastructure. The province has justified their decisions using citywide data on bike ridership, but the reason so few people ride bikes in Toronto is simply because the bike lane network is not extensive enough, with few lanes outside the downtown core. The specific bike lanes the province is targeting for removal actually have quite heavy bike traffic, making up up to 15% of total traffic in some areas. If the bike lane network were more fully developed, with more parts of the city accessible by bike, this number would increase, taking polluting cars off the road and giving more people a healthy and enjoyable option to commute. On the flip side, as bike lanes are removed, accidents and cyclist fatalities will increase, and people will be forced to take another mode of transportation or put their lives at risk. Furthermore, historical data shows that reducing bike lanes does not reduce congestion, as former cyclists become drivers who take up much more space on the roads. The city of Toronto has been building towards a world-class bike network over the past few years, and Bill 212 would be a huge step back based on misguided intentions and distorted data. Instead of spending millions of dollars on destroying infrastructure, the province spending it on building transit, which will actually improve congestion, and on healthcare and education, which will actually improve the lives of Ontarians.\n"

        "comment": "As a life-long cyclist (25 years in Toronto), I have biked hundreds of thousands of kilometers in multiple cities in the world.  Toronto - and Ontario - lag FAR behind in terms of appropriate infrastructure of CHOICE in safe transportation. Cities know their needs best - the province needs to remain out of these decisions around city planning.\nMore egregiously, removing bike lanes from some of the most travelled arteries in Toronto INVITE death and injury for vulnerable road users.  As a cyclist who was hit from behind by someone driving an SUV on a busy road without a bike lane, I can attest to the life changing impacts of unsafe infrastructure for all road users. And while I managed to ride for 45 years without a collision, largely in part due to my own competence in defensive riding, many people who are hit while cycling are inexperience riders, in even greater need of infrastructure that protects them.\nCycling - and infrastructure that encourages cycling, which bike lanes do - have innumerable benefits to individual health (physically and emotionally), community health, local economic health, and climate health. Empower municipalities to create plans that benefit ALL citizens.\n"

        "comment": "I am reaching out to express my concern over the proposed legislative direction that prioritizes drivers, especially with the potential removal of dedicated bicycle lanes. As a resident of Toronto and a professional in the field  urban design, I am passionate about building cities that prioritize people and sustainable urban growth. I believe removing bike lanes is a significant step backward for our city.\nBicycle lanes, particularly protected ones, serve as essential infrastructure for urban mobility. They enable more efficient movement of people within our limited urban space, encourage healthier, active lifestyles, and relieve some pressure from our already strained healthcare system. By supporting safe cycling, we can reduce the need for cars, create more vibrant, pedestrian-friendly communities, and support higher density, which is crucial in addressing our housing crisis.\nImproved public transit remains essential for Toronto\u2019s growth and livability. With projects like the Eglinton Crosstown LRT and Finch West LRT, Toronto has tremendous potential to shift away from car dependency. However, these projects have faced significant delays, limiting their benefit to the public. I urge you to advocate for accelerated timelines and greater transparency in these critical transit projects, so they can fulfill their role in moving people across our city effectively.\nI believe we need a renewed focus on urban mobility that recognizes cities as places for people first. Infrastructure decisions should prioritize the needs of cyclists, pedestrians, and transit users to foster a more sustainable and resilient Toronto.\n"

        "comment": "I think all bike lanes should be removed in Ontario. I appreciate the idea of bike lanes . However the climate and the urban sprawl in the province will forever prevent the benefit of bike lanes from being realized over vehicle traffic.\nI would guess that people commuting to work by bicycle represents 1% of road traffic or less. That % likely drops to near zero in late fall thru winter and early spring. It's just nonsensical to permanently close a lane of traffic for a bike lane  that is barely being used. Unless we start getting winters that stay above 10 degrees and all move downtown that is not going to change any time soon . Let's be realistic that's never going to happen so let's stop pretending and open those lanes back up.\n"

This proposed bill even ignores his own government task force's research. The logic that this will reduce congestion is also flawed. More and more people will HAVE to drive because they have no other option. Doug Ford is proposing a bill that surely will be a death sentence to many cyclists and pedestrians. It seems apparent that Ford's dream is a place where cycling and transit is deemed too inconvenient or dangerous and everyone has to have a car to have any mobility. He wants a place where the only walking anyone does is to and from the car parked a minute away. I doubt he has ever even biked throughout the city. Cyclists and pedestrians will die, businesses will suffer, and congestion will increase.\n"
