        "comment": "The suggestion that bike lanes contribute to increased traffic congestion is not only misleading but also dangerous. Your government\u2019s decision to target bike lanes on major streets, including Bloor Street and Yonge Street, appears to prioritize the convenience of a few drivers over the safety of cyclists and pedestrians, many of whom rely on this infrastructure for safe, daily travel.\nIf you genuinely believe that bike lanes negatively impact traffic flow, I challenge you to provide a single reputable study that supports the removal of bike lanes. I want to see clear, peer-reviewed evidence that proves bike lanes slow down traffic to a degree that justifies the risk to cyclists' lives. Without evidence, this policy decision comes across as arbitrary and an appeasement to car-centric voters, rather than a move based on public safety or effective traffic management.\nAdditionally, your interference in municipal affairs is deeply concerning, especially when regional transportation, healthcare, eldercare, and education require urgent attention. It is disappointing to see resources diverted towards dismantling critical local infrastructure while significant provincial issues remain unaddressed.\nStudies from cities around the world show that protected bike lanes actually help improve traffic flow, reduce collisions, and decrease overall travel times for all road users. I urge you to reconsider this approach and to make decisions based on data rather than rhetoric. Bike lanes are critical for urban mobility, environmental sustainability, and public safety. Removing them would be a significant step backward for Ontario.\nThe public deserves to know the facts behind this proposal. If there is no credible evidence supporting your stance, then it is clear that the decision to remove bike lanes is driven by ideology, not reality.\n"

        "comment": "As a downtown resident, I rely every day on protected bike lanes to commute to and from work. The expansion of protected bike lanes in the city has been instrumental to increasing the safety and speed of my trip. At the same time, we've observed the success of the Toronto Bike Share program leading to 6M+ new cycling trips per year - directly reducing traffic on Toronto streets. As demonstrated by the Bike Share program, it's important to consider that choosing to bike is not a political choice but a practical decision to get to where you need to go quickly and efficiently.\nFor some perspective, I am fortunate enough to be able to afford a car and I am financially able to drive to work. Instead of choosing to bike or take the TTC, I can easily choose to drive every day. If the legislation passes and bike lanes are removed, why should I risk my livelihood to continue to bike to work? Instead, your government would incentivize me to drive, in turn, creating more traffic in downtown Toronto. Given tens of thousands cyclists ride everyday, any cyclists that chooses to drive will only worsen the traffic issue in Toronto. Lastly, the government must consider the vulnerability of cyclists in mixed traffic. Unfortunately, a cyclist died in Toronto in 2023 and nearly 30 people have been critically injured. The province is responsible for the health and safety of its residents.\nOverall, I appreciate the government's commitment to reducing gridlock in the GTA. In particular, I believe the progress on the Ontario Line and GO Transit Expansion program will be transformational for the region. I strongly encourage the government to strengthen their investment into transit to address the issue instead:\n> (Similar to the Gardiner) Accelerate the constructions of SmartTrack stations and GO Expansion projects\n> Invest in the GO Bolton-Caledon line\n> Build ambitions projects like the Midtown GO Line\n> Fund the TTC & safe bike infrastructure\n"

Safe bike lanes give teenagers and those without a vehicle the freedom to get safely from one place to another on their own schedule. It also keeps them active and gets them to be more familiar with their community! Would love to see more bike lanes implemented!\n"

        "comment": "While this bill aims to protect vehicle lanes, it overlooks more effective solutions for reducing congestion. The approval process for bike lanes would increase municipal costs and project timelines, ultimately paid for by taxpayers. Rather than restricting bike infrastructure, converting street parking to travel lanes could provide greater benefits - each parking spot typically takes up the same space as an active travel lane. Research shows that well-designed bike lanes actually help reduce congestion by encouraging people to cycle for short trips, while forcing cyclists to share regular traffic lanes (due to lack of bike lanes) tends to slow traffic more than dedicated bike infrastructure would.\n"

I, a tax-paying Ontario Citizen, am abhorred at the Provincial overreach that is impeding infrastructure progress in our province.\nRetaining existing bike lanes, while planning for more integrated & hybrid commuter corridors is what would be in the best interest for Torontonians; NOT prioritizing automobiles.\nI am losing faith in our province's leadership. We have housing, climate change, and cost of living crises, and yet this administration wants to target... cyclists? Make it make sense.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose Bill 212, Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024, which introduces a top-down framework for managing bike lanes by requiring the removal of traffic lanes to follow provincial procedures. This legislation undermines the principle of municipal autonomy, which is central to effective urban planning and governance. Municipalities, being closest to their residents, must have the final say in adding or removing bike lanes, reflecting the priorities and unique needs of their communities.\nThis bill is extremely regressive. If anything, Ontario should be moving towards increased adoption of well-segregated bike lanes, which are essential not just from a sustainability perspective but also for improving public health and safety. Numerous studies highlight that protected bike lanes can encourage more people to cycle, reducing car dependency, carbon emissions, and congestion. Furthermore, encouraging active transportation plays a crucial role in tackling chronic health issues like obesity and heart disease, while fostering more livable, connected neighborhoods.\nRestricting municipal authority to implement bike lanes will discourage progress toward these goals and weaken local efforts to achieve greener, healthier urban environments. I urge the government to reconsider this approach and empower municipalities to lead bike lane decisions, in alignment with the principles of bottom-up governance.\n"

        "comment": "This bill will bypass critical environmental protections and endanger average Ontarians. There should be careful consideration and research done to support any expansion of car infrastructure and reduction or restriction on other traffic lanes, such as bike lanes. The fact is, making it harder for municipalities to improve road infrastructure to better move people is adding red tape and reducing the efficiency of government to make positive changes for the people. Investing heavily in car-centric transportation options, from highways down, is a recipe for environmental disaster, will contribute to the decline of our collective health and well being, and a massive waste of taxpayer dollars. Ontarians demand a people-centric transportation vision, that encourages safe multi-modal options, and rapidly improves public transport connectedness and frequency.\n"

        "comment": "The provincial government should not have any legal say in what municipalities do with their bike lanes. Bike lane infrastructure should be left to cities to decide on as they actually know what's happening at a local level. The information Doug Ford has been using/saying that bike lanes cause traffic is incorrect. There are multiple studies that have been published that show bike lanes can improve traffic times, and that creating more lanes for vehicles only creates more traffic and grid lock. Having access to different modes of transportation is beneficial to a city. The fact that someone who decides to bike to a destination has to worry about being killed due to unsafe road conditions with cars is unacceptable. The provinces proposal for bike lanes won't fix traffic issues and will only create a more disconnected city.\n"

        "comment": "This is one of the most bakwards proposals the MTO has ever come up with. If the province truly \"recognizes that accidents and lane closures can worsen traffic congestion and impact the quality of life of Ontarians\", it will recognize that bikes lanes REDUCE accidentsand REDUCE traffic congestion by reducing the number of cars on the street. It doesn't take a civil engineer to figure this out, and this is coming from a civil engineer.\nTo the point that \"Ontario is looking to fight gridlock and get drivers where they need to go faster\". You cannot simultaneously do these two things together, because drivers CAUSE gridlock. They are not stuck in traffic, they ARE the traffic. What will really improve overall commute time for peopel ,especially in an urban setting where gridlock is prominent, is to offer alternative transportation solutions like safe bike lanes, fast transit, etc. The solution for urban gridlock is NEVER to add more lanes and promote even more driving.\nThis is immensly disappointing coming from the MTO and the province. The deaths of cyclists as a result of this proposal will be on MTO's hands, the increased loss time to gridlock for all commuters, not just drivers, will be on MTO's hands. As a civil engineer it is a SHAME that zero critial thinking went into the development of this proposal, despite years of research in civil engineering proving that \"one more lane will not solve traffic problems\". MTO is on track to ruining safe and reliable transportation for the biggest municipalities in Ontario, in an effort to appease regions that should have no say in how another municipality constructs transportation infrastructure. Shame on MTO, shame on the province.\n"
