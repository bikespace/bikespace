        "comment": "This is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard of.  In what world does the provincial government know more about the local traffic patterns, needs and designs that the city government.  Why would some bureaucrat in Toronto need to sign off on a bike lane in Sudbury - along with all the red tape and procedural hoops that will come with this bill?  That just adds more cost to the tax payers.  I've never sat in gridlock on a highway because of a bike lane on a city street.    If more people used bikes and public transit, there would be less cars on the streets and faster traffic overall.  Doing away with bike lanes will not remove the bikes from the streets, the bikes will just be in the lanes with the cars, which slows traffic down even more!\n"

Not only is this a gross overreach of provincial authority into municipal matters, it's politically and substantively useless because it will do nothing to reduce traffic. Bikes and other alternative modes of transportation reduce have been proven to reduce vehicle traffic. I honestly can't think of a single evidence-based reason to introduce a bill like this, other than to distract and waste taxpayers' time, money, and attention.\nNeed we remind you that our public healthcare and education systems are in shambles and massively underfunded after COVID? Yet, this is what our provincial government chooses to focus on. Shame on all of you.\n"

        "comment": "I would like to make you aware that this is terrible legislation on multiple levels.\nIt is an absurd overreach of provincial power. Why is the province wasting its time and resources micro managing municipalities, who have democratically voted in support of the transportation infrastructure of their choice.\nSecond, ripping out existing bike lines is just a stupid waste of money.\nYou want to reduce gridlock? Reduce the number of people in cars. That's it. That is literally the only way. There is endless data demonstrating this. You will not solve gridlock with new lanes, or by pissing away billions of dollars on a tunnel. You need to\na) Divert people away from high density areas. People should not be growing THROUGH Toronto unless their destination is in Toronto\nb) Providing effective alternative transport methods such as robust public transit and avenues for active transport (LIKE BIKE LANES), so people can do things other then drive.\nc) Change zoning laws to allow for more mixed use neighborhoods so more people can live close to where they work so they don't have to commute, or at the very least, live close to shops and services so they can access the majority of what they need either without a car, or with a very short drive.\nd) The prominent list of proposed bike line changes are clearly Mr. Ford's daily commute. This is not about good policy, to him it is personal, isn't?   To him I say, \"Are you even at Queen's Park most days?\"\nd) Sneaking in changes to Environmental assessments is blatant attempt to bury the lead, and is not becoming of a responsible Government.  Those assessments are critical, as we only have one environment, and we don't get a second chance if we mess it up (further).  Yes, sometimes these assessments come take some time, and require changes to infrastructure plans, but that is the point. We need to take in expert opinions to minimize environmental damage.\nBlatantly ignoring evidence based solutions because the Premier has decided he has a beef with bike lanes for some reason will make gridlock worse, not better, and your time and tax payer money would be better spent addressing issues like Healthcare and Education, that are actually the province's responsibility, instead of micromanaging municipal affairs. If the Premier wants to be mayor of Toronto so badly, he should resign and run in the next election, and leave being Premier to someone who knows what they are doing.\n"

        "comment": "This is absolutely abysmal! Hands off local, municipal matters! This is a severe overreach and abuse of power for an issue that should rest in the hands of the City of Toronto, not the Province of Ontario. Overreach from the Province circumvents the democracy of Torontonians who elect our councillors and our mayor to make decisions of this nature - not the Premier. Time and time again, strong evidence proves that bicycle infrastructure DOES NOT cause congestion. It actually ALLEVIATES congestion. Once again, Premier Ford is going against all facts, evidence and expert opinion. Every year, Toronto experiences so many collisions between motorists (who often don\u2019t even live in our City!) and cyclists. Listen to ONE of the victims and their families to understand just how detrimental removing protected cycling infrastructure would be. It is not worth the LIVES of citizens. Cycling over driving helps human health, the environment and the economy. Ripping out the current infrastructure and putting it on secondary streets is so costly and wasteful for a city that does not even have the proper revenue or financial support from the province to operate its basic services - some of which are way more important like shelters, for example. I cannot begin to understand why this Premier would put forward legislation that is so backward in nature. Look at any world class city and you will see that cycling has so many more benefits than driving. You are ruining our city and province. Get some education - listen to the experts, listen to your electorate! There is very little support for this initiative, especially among those who actually study this for a living. These one off bills that no one has asked for are so sloppy and ill advised, it seems like a child thought about and wrote them in an afternoon day dream. Shameful!\n"

        "comment": "This policy is a terrible move by the province that stems from a single fallacy: that more traffic lanes will improve traffic flow, while fewer lanes will impede it. Cars are, by design, extremely inefficient for moving people compared to every other urban transportation mode. Dedicated bus lanes and separated cycling lanes can move greater amounts of people per hour than a single car lane. Tram/LRT systems trounce vehicular lanes in this regard as well. Would the province ever think to introduce policy that would require approval to install a bus lane if it meant the removal of a car traffic lanes? What about forbidding a new tram-line?\nThis seems like a blatant targetting of cyclists, and using them as a scapegoat for traffic issues caused by cars and the lack of reliable public transit and active transportation options. If anything, this policy will eventually force people who would use a bicycle to either use their car or cycle amidst car traffic. The former only adds to traffic congestion and the latter being statistically far more dangerous. Cities across Ontario, and Canada in general, are investing in cycling infrastructure because it creates a safe space for cyclists to ride, which encourages cycling as a reliable mode of transportation and also reduces the risk of injury or death caused by cars.\nAdding unnecessary red tape to creating safe and inclusive cycling infrastructure will mean fewer people adopting cycling as an option to get around. Cycling is good for your health physical and mental health, has very little up-front and long-term maintenance costs, costs fewer tax dollars on road/path maintenance , produces no greenhouse emissions, contributes very little to noise pollution, benefits local businesses, is more inclusive to disabled or low-income residents and provides citizens with a more rewarding way to get around their cities.\nI'll end on this: the only way to reduce traffic is get fewer cars on the road. The only ways to do that are to provide reliable public transit, or encouraging other, more safe and efficient ways of moving individuals, such as separated cycling paths.\n- Tanner from Ottawa\n"

Also, FUND TRANSIT and you'll see gridlock disappear. Right now walking or biking is the fastest way to get around my neighborhood in Riverside. More space for cars = more traffic. Provide alternatives (bike lanes and transit) and people WILL USE THEM! This isn't rocket science. It's been implemented all over the world with resounding success. Finally, it's an absurd waste of resources to rip up what was recently built for biking infrastructure. More construction will only end up with MORE traffic.\n"

        "comment": "There simply is not enough space in our cities to allow for everyone to drive and use cars without traffic. This is proven in every medium to large city on earth. Alternate modes of transportation are therefore necessary to increase the flow of people through our cities.\nAfter cars, the next fastest mode of local transportation is bicycles. Our cyclists are spending money at local businesses, our bars, restaurants, shops and corner stores. Cyclists require safe routes to navigate our cities and we need these routes to help connect them to local businesses.\nRemoving cycling lanes will not significantly reduce traffic. It will force cyclists to also drive their cars instead of cycling, adding to the traffic congestion.\nOur cities are still growing. There will be more people who need to commute and who need to go out shopping. There is no additional room to add more roadways. How will we enable 50 percent more people to travel without our cities? If we limit our solution to roadways for cars, we will not be able to solve this problem efficiently or effectively.\nThe proposal to remove existing bicycle infrastructure is a demonstration of gross negligence and it will waste our tax dollars erasing municipal investments.\nIf this proceeds, there will be an increase in cyclist deaths. There will be an increase in cars and an increase in required parking. There will be even more traffic, rather than less. There is no good that will come from this, it is a politically motivated decision that does not consider the whole of our society.\n"

        "comment": "As a resident living in South Etobicoke on Royal York and Bloor, it has been extremely frustrating that city council has not listened to feedback from the community regarding the implementation of bike lanes that take away from car lanes. Biking is not feasible in suburban parts of the city, where restaurants, stores, etc. are very spread out and people rely on their cars to get where they need to go. The gridlock created by the Bloor Street bike lanes in this area has been frustrating for drivers and harmed local businesses, with very few people using the bike lanes, even during the warm summer months. Given that city council has no intention on listening to residents, I support the government's bill requiring municipalities to get approval for these lanes, as it will be more likely that our voices will be heard and proper actions can be implemented\n"

        "comment": "The construction and placement of bike lanes should be left under the control of the municipality, not the province.\nRemoving bike lanes will have very little  (if any) effect on improving traffic flow in busy cities. And in many large cities (such as Toronto), a lot of people already rely on these lanes in order to travel safely by bike.\nMoreover, designated bike lanes not only offer safety to cyclists, but also to drivers and pedestrians. When bikes have a dedicated lane, they don't have to dodge around cars on the road or people on the sidewalk. Also, drivers don't have to move into oncoming traffic in order to go around a cyclist.\nInstead of trying to remove bike lanes, we should focusing on improving public transit options (and finishing the current projects under way), so that more people are encouraged to use alternate modes of transportation rather than a car. This both benefits the environment and reduces congestion on the roads.\n"

I\u2019m excited for my son to use them as he grows up and becomes more independent to get around safely. I wish every parent in Ontario had the same peace of mind in their own neighborhoods. Unfortunately, this act will put children (and adults) at unnecessary risk by politicizing the construction of bike lanes.

The best way to reduce congestion in cities is to get people out of cars entirely. Cars are a major contributor to pollution, inefficient at moving people around, and dangerous to our communities.\nCities and the province should be: a) encouraging more biking, walking, and use of public transit (this includes making public transit fast and convenient, which it most certainly is not in Ottawa at the moment); b) incentivizing businesses to reinstate or stay the course with work-from-home policies; and c) building more dense downtown housing.\nMore urban sprawl, wider highways and streets, and additional cars on the road are NOT the answer.\n"

We are a household where both adults in the home commute from the East End to downtown Toronto, including child pick up and drop off via bicycle. Biking from our home in the East End to downtown reduces our commutes by half compared to transit or driving. It also saves our family money by not having to pay for parking downtown or for transit fares. Cycling infrastructure reduces congestion on the roads by allowing people safe options to get around the city without having to use their vehicles. It promotes active, healthy lifestyles and reduces pollution. Removing safe and effective cycling infrastructure is a regressive policy measure that does not help the city of Toronto or the residents of Ontario who live here.\n"

Pedestrians in a city should be considered a commodity and locals of the city of Toronto do not want more motor vehicles driving in the downtown core. According to a 2016 study published by Statistics Canada the majority of residents in the city of Toronto do not use a motor vehicle to commute to work (56% do not use a car to commute to work) and can only imagine the number of people who do not own a car to have only increased in the 8 years since this study was done. Prioritizing more lanes for cars rather than cyclists and pedestrians in the city would be overlooking the majority of the individuals who live in the city.\n"
