        "comment": "This bill will not work. The idea of removing bike lanes won\u2019t reduce gridlock as is shown in every other major city around the world. New York a city with much worse traffic then Toronto when they removed a lane and installed bike lanes saw a significant reduction in traffic. This bill should be retitled to \u201cBill 212 inducing traffic in Toronto\u201d because it will simply tap into a phenomenon that\u2019s been recognized since the 1960s that when you add car lane capacity you will simply fill that capacity and end up with even more traffic. This bill is using intentionally misleading information as \u201ctraffic has increased since the installation\u201d. Ignoring that traffic increased in places where more car lanes were added more significantly and that will occur on all roads and streets in Toronto again. If the province wants to reduce gridlock it should fix the lack of transit in Toronto and fix the inability of drivers to understand road regulations. Not to mention the safety of road users are at stake as Car collisions kill more Torontonains than Gun violence unfortunately Cyclists and pedestrians will die when hit by a car and it happens very often with how road users are unable to follow the law on cyclists. Regardless this is the province overstepping it\u2019s boundaries as the added maintenance of these larger roads inevitably will be on the city to foot the bill right. Unless the province plans to pay for road maintenance too this won\u2019t help anyone car drivers will still be stuck in traffic in a year (worse traffic with much more bodily injury and fatalities), it snubs cyclists of the right to be safe on the roads, and it will cost the city money to maintain, adds more red tape to do something the city already has enough red tape for.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are so important! Bikes are a healthy, efficient, and green mode of local travel, and we should be doing everything possible to encourage people to bike when possible - the lack of bike lanes and poor quality existing bike lanes are a massive hurdle for cyclists, and requiring provincial approval for small municipal works like building a bike lane will stall these projects for years, further discouraging people from using this environmentally friendly method of travel.\nIt's difficult and dangerous to bike on busy streets and sidewalks without bike lanes, and many areas have improperly protected bike lanes that end randomly, are largely or completely unprotected from the nearby car traffic, or even have cars parking in the bike lane. All of these things are huge hurdles to cyclists, making their commute more dangerous and stressful - removing a car lane to add safe and pleasant bike lanes makes cycling more appealing, and if done smartly and efficiently, should not increase or bottleneck the remaining car traffic. Even one way streets can be very efficient, and are easily navigated by skilled drivers.\nIncreased bike lanes also make it safer and more pleasant for pedestrians, and these projects are often a good opportunity to create more or wider sidewalks and small green spaces around urban areas. These revitalization efforts also benefit local businesses that rely on pedestrian access and tourist economy to thrive. From my point of view, building safe and good quality bike lanes is one of the most universally beneficial urban development projects a city can enact today, and the Conservative Government wants to make it more difficult? What a joke.\nEnvironmentally friendly, healthy, accessible, community-based infrastructure that can benefit the local economy and overall ethos of the area is invaluable! Don't gum up the works even more.\n"

Study after study has shown we need to move away from increasing car infrastructure and move towards mass transit and biking infrastructure as cities densify.

This is bill is playing a political game with people's lives for a personal vendetta and it is an embarrassment to the province.\nNone of this will solve congestion. Personal vehicles do not solve congestion they create it.  Investments in public transit and active transportation like cycling reduce congestion, reduce pollution, reduce stress and provide more equitable and safe options for people of all ages and financial means to get around an urban area.  What this bill proposes is. War on the poor and it is criminal.\nShame.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes to reduce congestion is like trying to fight fire with fire. Believe it or not, the only thing causing congestion is cars. More bikes = less cars. It\u2019s pretty simple stuff, but we all know how much difficulty the ford government has with even the most simple of ideas. Or maybe they just think Ontario is stupid enough to buy this, afterall we were stupid enough to give Ford another majority. This, along with the removal of environmental protections to push through hwy 413 are clear examples of how this government is not to be trusted and is devoted to making life less and less pleasant for the average Ontarian.\n"

        "comment": "You can tell this act is short-sighted by reading just one part of one sentence: \"get drivers where they need to go faster.\"  Not all Ontarians drive!  And those that do aren't always driving!  This short-sighted focus on prioritizing cars over literally all other forms of transportation not only excludes a huge segment of Ontarians, it ALSO ignores the fact that when you get cars off the road by enabling other transit options -- including and especially cyclists with bicycle lanes, the remaining cars on the road can indeed move more smoothly and faster towards their destinations.  So this act won't even help drivers!\nThis information is available in countless studies, and has been put successfully into practice in many other cities, including cities with climate similar or more challenging than ours.  This reads as careless ignorance at best, or at worst as a calculated ploy to drum up a new contentious talking point for the upcoming provincial election.  Actually, I'm not sure which is worse, they're both pretty awful.\nI expect better from our leaders.  Not from Ford, to be clear, this is exactly what I expect from him and his government.  But those in charge should have OUR interests at heart, not THEIRS.\n"
