        "comment": "This bill will do absolutely nothing to reduce congestion in any meaningful way. If that was the goal, it would contain a mix of improvements for far more than just cars (significantly more money for public transit which Ottawa has been begging for, significantly more money to repair sidewalks and build new sidewalks for pedestrians and those with mobility impairments, more money for more bike lanes, etc.) Simply put, there are too many cars on the road as under investment in all non-car infrastructure has resulted in an extremely car-centric Ontario (and North America, really). Treating bike lanes as boogey men is an absurd tactic when removing them will just lead to more cars and more street parking, furthering induced demand and resulting in yet even more traffic. Who will the next boogey man be at that point when this inevitably fixes nothing?\nThis bill is even more ridiculous when it has language allowing the government to essentially bypass the full environmental assessment of Highway 413, as well as freeze increases to driving test fares (which just makes drive tests more affordable and therefore, more people getting licences and more cars on the road).\nI live in downtown Ottawa. I do not own a car as I centred my life to not require one. I take public transit and I walk/bike everywhere. There are so few places in this province where people can live like this, and even where I live I am almost hit by cars when crossing streets as a pedestrian or when cars park in bike lanes every week. This bill will do nothing to improve my safety as it only emboldens this type of behaviour.\nThis bill is yet another heap of divisive nonsense that distracts from the real issues facing this province (lack of healthcare funding, spiralling out of control rents, etc.). For once, I wish this government would actually put forward a bold vision. Instead it's just been millions wasted to get beer in corner stores early, pot shops spread out on every corner, gambling advertisements everywhere, and now a war on bike lanes.\nHave a soul and scrap this horrible policy that will just worsen the environmental decline that a fully car-centric society drives.\n"

        "comment": "Building more lanes and highways will NOT ease congestion. All it does is induce demand for more cars on the road. There have been research and studies already made on this. If you want to reduce congestion, you have to offer more efficient alternative modes of transportation. That means investing in PUBLIC TRANSIT and even BIKE LANES.  It is MORE EFFICIENT to transport 100 people on 1 train than 100 people in 100 cars. Since most cars on the road are single occupants, 100 bikes takes up LESS SPACE than 100 cars.\nYou can also reduce traffic by encouraging policies such as WORK FROM HOME. Most office workers can just do their work from home. There's really no reason for them to be commuting and adding to the traffic. Traffic SPIKED the moment RTO was introduced.\nThis bill just shows poor urban planning and poor understanding of economics. Do better.\n"

        "comment": "I am unequivocally against bill 212 and everything it will do to transportation in Ontario. Forcing cities to seek provincial approval before they can add bike lanes will overwhelmingly hinder the expansion of our province's cycling infrastructure, slowing the expansion of alternate transportation methods and further tightening the people of Ontario's dependence on cars, and therefore worsening our already terrible traffic problem. I am also offended and disappointed in my representatives and the officials responsible for 212 for their ignorance at best, obvious bias at worst, in the way this bill has been written. If I were to just read the proposal for this bill without knowing anything about urban planning I might be tricked into thinking this bill would actually help our traffic problems - I find this proposed bill to be manipulative of Ontario residents who haven't spent the time I have on educating myself about our transportation problems, and I am deeply concerned that our government officials think this bill is in any way acceptable or supportive of our cities' efforts to choose for themselves how best to offer their citizens the means to choose any form of transportation other than a car.\n"

        "comment": "Not sure where data is coming from that more \u201cpro-auto\u201d infrastructure is needed when that will just cause more traffic. Ontario public transportation is either non existent or crumbling. If more money and focus went into improving public transportation in cities and towns the traffic and congestion would decrease. Less vehicles on the road. More people on buses and trains. I am a vehicle owner and I wish my city (Ottawa) had reliable public transit. I\u2019d love not to drive everyday to work, I\u2019d gladly take a bus or train if it were reliable and didn\u2019t take 2 hours to get from one end of the city to the other. Please focus on public transit before building more useless highways.\n"

        "comment": "This neglects the needs of actual residents within municipalities, and will lead to more gridlock within cities. Cars take up more space than bikes, public transport + cycling should take priority over car traffic within high density regions like Toronto. Gridlock is caused by cars, period. This provides unnecessary power to the province, and increases the workload + costs of provincial government workers to re-evaluate old lanes + evaluate new proposals. Some of the proposed re-evaluation sites don't even have space for additional lanes. It's hard to understand the value and rationale as it being in good faith.\nThis proposal makes little sense, and works against the interests of a better future.\n"

        "comment": "It is worrying that the province is seeking to put in place measures that would delay progress in improving transit in the city of Toronto.\nBike lanes provide a vital and safe alternative means of travel that helps benefit all residents of the city, across various age groups and economic brackets.\nAny reduction of bike lanes undoes years of work, advocacy and progress in improving the ability to traverse Toronto.\nWith more high density high rise buildings being built, Toronto needs an expanded bike lanes system to help new residents move around the city.\nHaving one more road for a car is not going to make a significant difference to traffic levels in the city. The city is inherently a dense network of streets where cars will get gridlocked. Even more importantly, there's only so many roads cars can have in the city unless buildings/homes/business were demolished to make way for new roads - which would destroy the city.\nBike lanes are vital to providing an alternative method of travel that helps people complete short-medium distance trips (the most people in the city do frequently) without the need of a car, which then aids traffic congestion.\n"

        "comment": "This province needs more bike lanes, not less. Bikes should have a barrier to separate them from irate car drivers. More people would be safely biking if there was proper infrastructure to do so. I am one of them.\nI strongly oppose highway 413. We need our greenbelt. Humans are part of a delicate ecosystem and we shouldn't be paving over everything just because our premier got some kick backs at his daughter's wedding.\n"

        "comment": "I am not a politically active person, but this proposal is so disappointing I feel compelled to comment.\nLast year, my husband and I sold our car because the bike infrastructure on bloor allowed us to get to work easily and safely. This has had an incredible improvement on our quality of life and overall health. It has made it easier for us to save money for a down-payment for a house.\nRemoving these bike lanes would only increase congestation. All you need to do is look at the bike share ridership-- which grew by 30% to 4.6 million in 2022 and 24% to 5.7 million in 2023 --- to realize that biking is on the rise in Toronto. Forcing millions to get back in cars will do little to reduce congestation. Removing the convenience and safety of bike lanes on these main roads will put people like me back in traffic lanes.\nThis is reckless over spending. I thought conservatives were supposed to be fiscally responsible? The amount of money that will be needed to take out these lanes is astronomical.\nThe government could stop micromanaging our city and focus their attention, and funds, on the dire state of our healthcare in this province. Toronto traffic is not the province's jurisdiction. Why doesn't this government stay in their own lane?\n"

        "comment": "This idea is ridiculous. I bike along the bloor bike lane everyday to work. If you remove the bike lane, I won\u2019t stop biking, which means I\u2019ll be impeding traffic by going half the speed. It won\u2019t solve anything. It will only cause more road rage, as cars are stuck behind cyclists, some of which are not fast.\nPlease spend more time focusing on provincial jurisdiction, like healthcare. All this is doing is pandering to get votes from people who don\u2019t even live in Toronto\n"
