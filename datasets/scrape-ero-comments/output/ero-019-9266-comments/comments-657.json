I concur with this feedback, and urge anyone with influence over the Premier's office to do what they can to promote real evidence, rather than so called \"common sense\" which for the past 70 years has led us down a circular path of endless highway expansion followed by more congestion, at a great cost to people's time, the economy, and the environment.\nListen to the experts.

        "comment": "Removing and making it administratively more difficult to add bike lanes is not the way to reduce gridlock. Adding more traffic lanes only makes traffic worse as it disincetivizes people who could use alternative means of transport. By making it easier for people who could use bikes or transit, alternatives to cars reduce travel time for people who can't reasonably use alternatives to cars.\nUrban planning has wrongly been prioritizing cars when it should prioritize people, and making streets and neighborhoods where people want to spend time and build connections and communities. Cars are so big, fast, and heavy that they can easily injure or kill people outside of them, all while taking up much more space than people on bikes or in transit. Isolating people inside of the shells of cars allows them to dehumanizing other road users, while the current car-centric culture minimizes the dangers and environmental and societal costs of car use. Infrastructure that allows cheaper and more environmentally friendly transport is a societal benefit as it increases mobility for those without as many resources, such as students, migrants, and the elderly.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to voice my opposition to proposed Bill 212. I feel Bill 212 is based on misguided ideology, not empirical evidence. As we hurtle towards climate disaster, we need more policies that encourage clean ways of commuting. This proposed bill, will discourage cycling and increase gridlock. If the goal really is to reduce gridlock, the emphasis would be on reducing the number of cars and trucks on the roads.\nI am a car driver and a cyclist. I regularly commute to work by bicycle to work and shopping, in the warmer months. I would continue to do this in the winter if there were safe bike lanes. Unfortunately, where I live, the shoulders of the roads are where the snow gets dumped, making it very hazardous to ride along the shoulders.\nI feel it is ironic that a governing party, which says it is against big government and red tape, routinely brings in laws that increase the intrusion of this government on the municipal and regional policy development. Each municipality should have the power to determine the best practice for their citizens, based on the local needs and wants, rather than a \"Big Brother\" mandating what they must do in areas of infrastructure, transportation, and urban planning.\nFinally, the more people who regularly cycle, the lower the burden on our health care system. If this government was really interested in fiscal conservative policy, they would be clamouring for more bike lanes.\nGovernment of Ontario - Please do better!\n"

It's completely insane.\nIt also takes away municipalities ability to do things that are working for them includk g the Toronto bike lanes, that all statistics prove were a great idea, and need to stay.  It's insanely wasteful to remove heavily used expensive bike infrastructure.\nThis bill is also sickening overreach from a frankly anti bicycle administration.  Doug Ford hates cyclists, and is taking it out with this disgusting bill.\nNone of this makes any sense, if the goal is to increase alternative travel, and use less fossile fuels, increasing the already immense barriers to setting up bicycle infrastructure is counter productive.\n"

        "comment": "I am firmly opposed to the proposed legislation and it is a complete waste of time for the government to even be considering this Bill when there are real problems Ontarians are facing, such as lack of access to health care and chronic underfunding of public transit. I would like to point I do not live in Toronto and I am not a cyclist, so the loss of bike lanes in downtown Toronto has no effect on me.\nHere are the reasons why it is terrible legislation:\n(1) It ignores the research from actual international transportation experts who have studied bike lanes. Mr. Ford does not know better than experts simply because he was stuck in traffic one day. Cars are the ultimate cause of gridlock and there are simply too many cars in Toronto. Large cities like New York and London face similar issues. The solution is to reduce the number of cars by increasing the reliability and reach of public transit. Not blaming cyclists!\n(2) Removing bike lanes will slow down traffic. I regularly travel on roads without bike lanes that I have to share with cyclists. Has Doug Ford ever experienced driving 80 km/hour around a bend and then realizing there is a cyclist at the edge of your lane? I have. It's dangerous for all of us. As a driver, you and every car behind you have to abruptly slow down quickly to the cyclists speed until you can all safely switch lanes since it is against the law to pass them without giving ample space. When the bikes are in their own bike lane, these sorts of random slowdowns do not happen.\n(3) It is safer for everyone. Bikes are considered vehicles so they must be on the road. Ideally, cars, bikes and pedestrians would all have their own dedicated lanes on all major city roads, just like is done in cities like Paris and Amsterdam. Do you really want to be the government responsible for shaving 30 s off a commute at the expense of the safety and lives of cyclists? Is it really worth it? Of course not. As a parent, my children will one day be cycling on these roads, and I would feel much better if they were in bike lanes rather than on the roads!\n(4) It discourages people from commuting by bicycle. I'm not a cyclist, but I wish I lived in a community where I could commute by bike. But there are no bike lanes, so I do not feel safe doing so, especially in this world of distracted drivers.\n"

I disagree with removing sections of existing bike lanes on Bloor, Yonge and University Ave. This is a costly endeavour and I don\u2019t believe that this will help with gridlock. I live near the bike lanes along Bloor. The safety these lanes have provided me has encouraged me to get out of my car and onto my bike to get to and from work, as well as to run errands and visit friends around the city. I am now one less car on the streets of Toronto contributing to grid lock.\nIn addition I believe we should be making it easier,  not more difficult for municipalities to install new bike lanes. Biking is an eco-friendly and cost effective mode of transportation that we should be encouraging with the appropriate infrastructure.  I choose to bike to save money as I, and many others, continue to struggle with the cost of daily living. As well, I choose to bike as I think about the climate and about a greener future. I should not have to compromise my safety when I make the decision to bike, nor should other Torontonians!\n"

I witnessed a car accident caused by speeding.\nA six year old girl, a neighbour, a child I had the great pleasure of interacting with as the manager of a local toy store made a tiny mistake and stepped onto the street. She was struck by a woman driving her SUV too fast and landed half a block away. I\u2019ll never stop hearing the sound of her little body bouncing off the hood of the car or the scream of her mother.\nSafe streets that slow traffic save lives. If the traffic had been forced to slow down by thoughtful infrastructure, my wee neighbour might still be here, instead of mourned by a community. Bike lanes are a key part of safe infrastructure in cities for a variety of reasons. Bike lanes are vital. Bike lanes could have saved my neighbour\u2019s life.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 is a misguided and shortsighted attempt to address traffic congestion in Ontario. Moreover, it reeks of government overreach, partisan maneuvering, and a fundamental disregard for evidence-based policies that prioritize safety, sustainability, and public well-being.\n1. Public Safety Is Non-Negotiable\nHow about we start with Premier Doug Ford\u2019s own words: \u201cYou\u2019re nervous when there\u2019s no bike lanes. At least I was. We have to do everything we can to make sure there\u2019s never a death in the city. One death is way too many when it comes to bicycle riders.\u201d (TVO\u2019s Political Blind Date, Season 1, Episode 2).\nSo why the sudden about-face? Because protected bike lanes save lives\u2014period. Studies from cities like Vancouver and New York City demonstrate that bike lanes reduce cyclist injuries and fatalities while improving safety for all road users (see supporting link of literature review from the University of British Columbia). Removing lanes on major corridors such as Bloor, Yonge, and University is not just reckless; it\u2019s dangerous. What does this bill say to the parents of Alex Amaro, killed riding her bike on Dufferin Street in 2020. Because as they say: \u201cbike lanes could have saved our daughter\u201d.\n2. Bike Lanes Do Not Cause Congestion\nContrary to the bill\u2019s premise, eliminating bike lanes will worsen gridlock. Studies from New York, London, and the UK\u2019s Department of Transport show that reallocating space to cycling infrastructure reduces car dependency, improving traffic flow (see supporting links). In fact, adding more car lanes creates induced demand\u2014encouraging more driving and worsening congestion. Removing bike lanes will only force more Ontarians into cars. If Ontario is serious about tackling traffic, it must prioritize infrastructure that moves people efficiently\u2014not cling to failed car-centric solutions.\n3. Bike Lanes Are Good For Business.\nBike lanes drive local economies. Businesses along Toronto\u2019s Bloor Street have seen increased customer traffic since bike lanes were introduced, as highlighted by the Economic Impact Study from the Toronto Centre for Active Transportation (see supporting link). Cyclists shop locally, spend more per visit, and return more often\u2014boosting small businesses. Removing these lanes is not just bad policy\u2014it\u2019s bad business.\n4. The Costs of Removal Are Astronomical\nCity staff estimate that removing bike lanes on Bloor, Yonge, and University would cost at least $48 million\u2014excluding the inevitable disruption to businesses, residents, and transit users during construction. This staggering price tag would fund a project that actively undermines safety, mobility, and business. How can such reckless spending be justified? To my fellow Ontarians living outside Toronto, why should your tax dollars bankroll such wasteful spending?\n5. Environmental Commitments Are at Stake\nTransportation accounts for nearly 24% of Canada\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. Cities around the world are embracing bike lanes as tools to fight climate change. Amsterdam, a global leader in cycling infrastructure, saves an estimated 27,000 tons of CO\u2082 annually through bike-friendly policies. Ontario should be following these proven examples\u2014not dismantling the very infrastructure that fosters sustainability and supports a healthier future.\nBill 212 is not a solution\u2014it\u2019s a step backward. It\u2019s a sad attempt to invoke a culture war rather than craft evidence-based policies that genuinely help Ontarians. This bill exposes a government more interested in performative politics than addressing real challenges like overcrowded ERs, a struggling education system, and worsening gridlock across the GTHA. Ontarians deserve leadership with vision and substance, not empty gestures that hurt communities and waste resources.\nFinally, why was the public comment period abruptly shortened from 45 days (which is the standard) to 30? Perhaps I shouldn\u2019t be surprised by a government more eager to avoid scrutiny than engage with its constituents. Such disregard for transparency is both telling and shameful.\n"

        "comment": "I'm writing to share my massive concerns about the idea of reducing bike lanes in Toronto. I really believe that taking a step back on bike infrastructure would be a huge mistake for our city, the environment, and the economy.\nEven without taking environmental benefits into account, cycling brings a wide range of health and economic benefits that must be considered before deciding to remove bike lanes.\nCycling is great for public health. It\u2019s an easy way to get active, prevent chronic diseases, and reduce healthcare costs. The Ontario Public Health Association has said that increasing cycling could prevent thousands of premature deaths. Cutting bike lanes would be a step in the wrong direction, especially when we need to be prioritizing healthier lifestyles.\nStudies have shown that shops and restaurants near bike lanes see more customers and higher sales. Plus, cycling tourism is growing, which means more people visiting and spending money in Ontario.\nNot only that, but removing the lanes will be very costly to taxpayers. A just-released City report tallies the initial total cost to taxpayers of removing these bike lanes at $75 million in direct and sunk costs, and notes increased ridership of up to 600% in some of the lanes planned for removal, with minimal impact on car travel times. So, this move isn't even going to achieve the desired effect you want it to achieve!\nWe need more infrastructure that encourages walking, biking, and transit use if we want to make the city more sustainable, healthy, and vibrant for ALL (and not just the wealthiest and most affluent of us!)\n"
