        "comment": "I can appreciate attempts to address the traffic issues in Toronto. However, removing bike lanes is not a real solution. This will endanger and discourage bikers. Biking is part of the culture of dense urban areas like Toronto. It should be encouraged, as biking is healthier alternative to driving, for both commuters and the planet.\nAs someone living downtown, there are many times it would be more convenient for me to bike to get around, however due to high car density, I often feel intimidated and unsafe on the road. Downtown Torontoians need more bike lanes, and paths, not less. It's a cost effective mode of travel for people, and when people are biking, they are not driving. A robust biking system in the city will do more to reduce traffic than removing bike lanes. If those who commute into the downtown core drive, and those getting around locally were biking or walking or taking public transit, wouldn't that be the ideal way to improve traffic for everyone? So these things should be encouraged. What does removing bike lanes encourage? More driving. What does that do? Increase traffic. Why spend tax dollars to stand still? Or worse, regress by removing recently installed (and recently paid for) biking infrastructure?\nNot to mention the overreach of a provincial representative taking power from Toronto city officials simply to ram through this idea with no data to back up effectiveness.\nThis proposal strikes me as a shameless appeal to rich, suburban GTA'ers, for whom biking as a mode of primary travel is not practical nor desirable. I choose to live downtown because it's a walkable dense community. Why then are the needs of us locals overshadowed but the desires of those who have chosen the benefits of more square footage, backyards, and comfortable (if long) commutes by car?\nPlease protect Toronto and it's culture. Do not sacrifice that for the appearance of appealing to drivers. Especially when it will noy be effective at addressing the issue at hand. This is why city issues should be handled by city officials. It seems not too long ago when Doug Ford was empowering municipal servants with his support of Big City Mayors. Now he undercuts them? If he would like to make decisions at the municipal level, he should run for Mayor. Until then, he should allow the elected representative to her job.\nThank you for your time.\n"

        "comment": "I do not support this bill.\nI am a cyclist, driver, pedestrian and public transit user in downtown Toronto and the greater Toronto/Hamilton area.\nI am encouraged by the increased use of options like cycling and the expansion of cycling networks around the GTA. It\u2019s an important option for that last-mile transportation of people working in or out of the downtown core.\nRegions/municipalities, policy developers and researchers, have been working on these kinds of initiatives that prioritize modes of transport other than cars alone for many years now. Please see this resource page that Ontario itself has compiled: http://www.ontario.ca/page/resources-transportation-planners\nWasting money on removing bike lanes that are already installed by obstructing traffic is completely counterproductive. Not only are you making traffic worse during construction but you are pushing cyclists into regular traffic lanes with cars causing dangerous road conditions and slowing traffic even more. You are creating an environment where the fight between cars and bikes becomes even more amplified and polarized.\nAs a cyclist, I am confronted daily with unprovoked aggression by motor vehicle drivers. I follow road rules and cycling tactics to make myself more visible to avoid accidents. Aggression or intentional neglect for road safety by drivers that cause injuries to cyclists are not accidents, that is assault.\nBecause of this, I believe it is imperative to continue to install infrastructure that creates a safe barrier between cyclists and motor vehicles, in part, to reduce the increased animosity of drivers towards cyclists.\nThe safer we can make our cycling networks, the more people we can get onto bikes around our cities. I hear from people all the time who would like to ride in the city but they are too scared of the roads and the drivers- for some, it\u2019s because they have already been injured while cycling.\nOur cities are growing and they can\u2019t accommodate every person driving a car, regardless of how many bike lanes you rip up. Most new residential buildings downtown already embrace this fact by offering far fewer car parking spaces than bike parking.\nI also warn the province of the impact on our local economies, particularly in Toronto, when delivery people using bikes and e-bikes, can no longer safely and efficiently traverse the city. When deliveries cannot be made efficiently, the number of delivery drivers will significantly fall because they cannot break even. This will be terrible for restaurants that rely on the income from delivery apps. These riders rely on the already limited cycling network of Toronto.\nThere is a myth that more lanes will reduce congestion. The truth is that more lanes causes more demand. More people will NEED to use motor vehicles to move around the cities, and that is not what we need. That will just cause more congestion, more pollution and a worse city to work, visit and live in. Do we not need the tourism dollars? In the past couple years, I\u2019ve talked to more tourists on bikes than I could count.\nThe more cycle and transit networks made available, the more people will use it.\nIf you don\u2019t see people using certain parts of a cycle network as much as others, it\u2019s because it\u2019s not properly connected to a full network. When a bike lane lasts for a few city blocks but then stops at a dangerous intersection, that needs to be fixed before you\u2019ll see full usage. Cities need more funding to improve these networks.\nNow is not the time to prioritize car lanes.\nPut the money into making the city accessible for everyone. Improve public transit, improve wheel trans and other accessible transit options, improve cycling networks, improve connections to go trains and regional transit, make municipalities more walkable, improve sidewalk snow removal.\nThere is so much more you could do instead of spending money and time ripping up already built bike tracks and making municipalities go through endless proposals to make our regions better.\nThank you for your time.\n"

        "comment": "The prioritization of cars over alternative modes of transportation is an exercise in backward thinking. As the population continues to grow, it is simply not feasible to expect efficient, single-occupancy vehicles commutes through major urban centers. Ensuring the longevity of car lanes will do nothing to alleviate the underlying issue, as evident by the principles of induced demand. To move people around efficiently, the only real solution is to reduce out dependency on cars in a manner that is both safe and responsible. Bike lanes do just that.\n"

The real solution is increasing funding for transit and biking.\nThis is a shocking example of provincial overreach and legislation that is completely uninformed by evidence.\n"

        "comment": "As a resident of Toronto who resides metres from Bloor street, I strongly appose this bill. The bike lanes on Bloor St allow for cycling traffic and travel safely and efficiently across one of the City's main through ways. I travel by car and bicycle  regularly on Bloor St., and Dupont st. and have found that there is little difference by care west of Avenue road. This is despite heavier pedestrian and more frequent stops on Bloor st. Furthermore cycling on Dupont st feels significantly less safe, and has regular areas where there is no room to stay clear of vehicles. This leads to bicycles slowing down car traffic often.\nA second major problem with this bill is the used of Provincial funds on Municipal infrastructure. I have no personal issue with provincial funds being allocated to municipal issues, however using this money seems like mismanagement, and will cost Millions of dollars of money where so many public services are lacking. Not withstanding the money that will be lost from businesses while this work is being completed.\nThe final comment I would be about amendments to The Build Highways Faster Act. This provides unnecessary powers to the upcoming Bradford Bypass Project, and the reduction of environmental responsibility for a project which will already have immense impact on critical lands, and flood planes.\n"

        "comment": "As a driver and a cyclist I know the dangers of biking in the city. I also know that most of the issues we see with cars are from lack of enforcement of traffic and parking laws and too many cars on the roads. Every great city in the world knows that cycling is the most efficient way to get people around a city, and does the most to support small businesses. Bikes don\u2019t need parking and can\u2019t block a lane while the owner runs into a store to grab something. Biking around the city should be fast, efficient, and SAFE and without bike lanes it risks lives trying to get around the city. I am also a homeowner, and would not agree to 48 million dollars of my tax money being used to remove a service I use every day. As a conservative government you should be ashamed of your infringement on the right of a citizen of Toronto to decide where their property tax money is directed and in particular to such a waste.\n"

        "comment": "I am a writing in my capacity as a Staff Psychiatrist at the University Health Network to express my grave concerns with the contents of this act. I am a cyclist, pedestrian, and driver. I write this objection first and foremost thinking of my patients. For background, I am an Assertive Community Treatment Psychiatrist and provide outreach care to the hardest-to-treat, highest-health-care-utilizing mental health patients. My job, and one that I am good at, is helping keep people out of hospital, thereby saving the system the worst of mental health care costs. Without bike lanes, I could not do my job. By bike, I am able to see 4-6 more patients per day than if I had to rely on my car. My bike gives me the flexibility to reach people emergently when they are in crisis. Without bike lanes, I will be less safe in my job and also less effective and efficient.\nAdditionally, I have multiple wider concerns with Bill 212, which I will outline in three points below:\n(1) This act represents the provincial government overreaching democratic mechanisms to interfere with municipal affairs as it pertains to the decision to oversee future bike lane installation in cities across on Ontario. The legislation outlined in this act, namely that bike lanes should not be installed where a lane of traffic might be lost, flies in the face of the overwhelming evidence that bike lanes save lives, have physical health benefits for the general population by promoting active transport, and have far-reaching health benefits by mitigating greenhouse gas emissions (with the climate crisis being named as the largest health threat of the 21st century). By justifying the decision to stymie bike lanes on the basis of congestion concerns, the Ontario Government is laying bare that it values an increased travel time of between 2-5 minutes on roads like Bloor St. over the benefits to human health and human life. In my opinion, this is a horrifying position, and one that is not widely held among Ontarians (and certainly not amongst physicians as evidenced by the 120 signatories on an open letter to the government). Moreover, other jurisdictions, such as Copenhagen and New York City, that have expanded bike lane networks have found that over a period of just several years the bike lanes ultimately led to decreased congestion and travel times. Municipalities in Ontario need the opportunity to expand their networks to prove that this is a more sustainable healthier way to reduce congestion rather than preventing development or - worse - ripping up bike lanes which will result only in death and morbidity rather than long-term congestion gains.\n(2) I am particularly against the Ontario government's decision to remove bike lanes in the City of Toronto without any input from the municipality. My vehement disagreement with this decision is in-part based on the safety and environmental concerns listed above (which obviously apply to the pre-existing bike lanes as well), but also on the fact that this type of action will:\n(a) stifle the new ridership which has come with high-quality bike lane installation which have a public health benefit due to increased active transport/physical activity in our population and decreased air pollution AND\n(b) cause worsening short-term congestion as the bike lanes are removed. AND\n(c) mean that Ontarian tax dollars (estimates have ranged from 48-75 million dollars) will be spent destroying infrastructure when they could be servicing Ontarian's health and education for much high benefit yields. I will speak to health specifically given my position as a physician. For example, it has been widely publicized that many rural Ontarians cannot access health care - even health care as essential as emergency departments. It is completely unconscionable that the Ontario government would choose to spend Ontarians' hard-earned tax dollars making Toronto's congestion worse over helping to fund life-saving essential services across the province. 48 million dollars is a substantial enough sum to help with the worst of the health care crisis, whether it be used to train new family physicians, keep emergency department doors open longer, or provide high-quality mental health & addictions or elder care (both high priority areas). No one is \"Saving Time\" by waiting in overcrowded emergency departments unable to see a physician due to staffing shortages. By choosing to spend this sum on ripping out bike lanes once again shows that the Ontario government is not serious about it's population's health and has highly misplaced priorities.\n(3) Finally, I object to this bill on the basis of its efforts to build Highway 413 without an environmental impact assessment. Highway 407 is built and underused. The government should spend its money wisely and rather than building new infrastructure come up with creative ways to utilitize existing infrastructure to Reduce Gridlock, Save Ontarians Time that does not decimate the important environmental resources of the province (namely, highly fertile farmlands and wetlands that will rescue us from catastrophic flooding). Moreover, by utilizing existing infrastructure, this government could have Ontarians saving time much more quickly than the multi-year time frame a major infrastructure development requires (even if some time is saved by bypassing an essential environmental impact assessment due to dubious legislative practices).\nThank you for reading my submission and I urge you to reconsider this piece of legislation immediately.\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nReducing gridlock cannot be achieved by penalizing cyclists.  I cycle everyday. It is my primary form of transportation. I cycle to get to work, for leisure, errands, and exercise. Cyclists share the rights of motorists which should ensure that we, as cyclists, have access to safe and separate lanes to travel on. Cyclists contribute to reducing congestion by removing cars from the road. A majority of motorists are single occupant drivers as are a majority of cyclists, but the space that cyclists require to operate is significantly less than that required by a motorist.\nOther provinces and municipalities in Canada are devoting resources to increasing bicycle-centric infrastructure. Why is Doug Ford trying to make it harder and more dangerous for cyclists to exist and operate? There are studies that indicate that introducing cycle-tracks and bike lanes reduce car-bike collisions by up to 2.57 times! This bill is not backed by data or statistics. It is an automotive and fossil fuel friendly deal that will contribute to increased congestion, emissions, demand for parking, and more dangerous conditions for cyclists and pedestrians.\nThis bill is an over-reach of the provincial government's power. This bill is a regressive step in urban planning and climate policy. I DO NOT stand for this bill and the precedent that it sets for provincial over-reach in municipal affairs. This is a shameful move by Doug Ford's government. It will hinder the development of sustainable and accessible communities across Ontario.\n"

        "comment": "I would like to express my concern regarding Bill 212, which proposes the removal of bike lanes along Bloor, University, and Yonge streets in Toronto to accommodate increased vehicular traffic flow. I believe this proposal does not effectively address the underlying issues of congestion and may exacerbate existing challenges relating to road safety and emissions. My concerns are as follows:\n1. Congestion is not solved by adding lanes: Simply adding extra lanes has not been proven to resolve congestion, as evidenced by persistent traffic issues on streets like Dupont. When more lanes are added, parked cars and bicycles often push traffic into the middle lane, causing vehicles to weave in and out, which not only disrupts the flow of traffic but also increases risks for both drivers and cyclists. This is not a sustainable or safe solution.\n2. Reducing congestion requires reducing car dependence: Congestion relief can only be achieved by reducing reliance on cars. This requires investment in safe, effective alternatives, such as expanding affordable public transportation and active travel infrastructure, including bike lanes. Removing bike lanes and limiting future infrastructure development is a step backward in fostering a more sustainable and efficient transportation system. Cities like Montreal, Paris, and London have shown that comprehensive infrastructure investment, coupled with strategies like congestion charging, has proven effective in reducing traffic congestion.\n3. Safety for cyclists and the environment: As a resident of Toronto who hopes to raise a family here, I want my children to be able to safely navigate the city by bike or foot, free from the dangers, noise, and pollution caused by an over-reliance on cars. Safe cycling infrastructure is crucial to both protect cyclists - who already face significant risks, including fatalities - and encourage cycling as a viable, sustainable alternative to driving. A shift toward active transportation also brings the added benefits of reduced emissions and improved public health.\n4. Pushing cyclists onto secondary roads is unsafe: Redirecting cyclists to narrower, secondary roads such as Huron presents additional risks, as there is often insufficient space for both cars and cyclists. This not only makes cycling less safe but also forces cyclists to travel further to reach their destinations. The current cycling infrastructure is already fragmented, and removing bike lanes exacerbates this disconnection, pushing cyclists into high-traffic areas where safety is compromised. Instead, we should be working to expand and connect bike lanes.\n5. Local decision-making should be respected: I am also concerned about the Ontario government's intervention in undermining the authority of municipalities. Decisions regarding transportation infrastructure and safety should be made by the City of Toronto, as they are best positioned to understand the needs and concerns of local residents.\nIn conclusion, I urge the government to reconsider the removal of bike lanes and prioritize solutions that reduce congestion in a sustainable and safe manner.\n"

This short-sighted focus on widening roads and building more highways is only encouraging more cars onto our already full streets, the negative impact of which, on the lives of all Ontarians, is increasingly evident - in the stress we suffer and the pollution that is contributing to our ill health.  We need safe bike lanes so that active transport can be an attractive option.  We already know that increased use of bicycles in urban areas reduces air pollution, noise pollution and promotes a healthier life-style.  The use of personal motor vehicles should, as is the case in other more enlightened parts of the world, be discouraged through congestion charges, tolls, slowing and eliminating car lanes, and investment in public urban transport and active transport infrastructure.\nThe proposal to remove bike lanes that are already in existence is baffling and a waste of money.  I would like to see this Bill 212 scrapped and for this and future governments to focus on things that will actually improve our lives.\n"
