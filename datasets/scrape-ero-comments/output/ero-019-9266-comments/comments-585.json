        "comment": "I believe this bill is a complete over reach by the provincial government.  Municipalities should be the level of government making these decisions.  As a cyclist I always fear for my life when riding on Ontario roads and it's about time the government values the physical well being of it's constituents.  I will take this as a physical attack on my life and will be taking this into account when I cast my votes.\n"

        "comment": "This legislation undermines good transportation planning, and I am concerned it will make it more difficult to build bike infrastructure that can reduce the number of deaths and catastrophic injuries on Ontario's roads. It will also put many municipalities\u2019 goals to mitigate climate change at risk.\nWhile it often goes underdiscussed in conversations about traffic and modal share, the reality is that many cycling infrastructure projects are put in as a direct response to tragic accidents and deaths of cyclists on the road. Cyclists are not just statistics \u2013 they are beloved family members, colleagues, and community members. This legislation is profoundly disrespectful to thousands of Ontarians whose lives have been profoundly changed by a road accident.\nThis is a government that claims to want to reduce red tape, and to be strong stewards of taxpayer dollars. If that\u2019s the case, why are they adding layers of bureaucracy to local decisions, and proposing to waste public dollars on ripping out brand new, highly used infrastructure? The data on bike lanes is clear \u2013 rather than increasing congestion, they decrease it by providing a safe alternative option.\nOntarians want common sense policies \u2013 to get from Point A to Point B safely and securely whether that\u2019s on foot, by bike, by bus, by train, and by car. Bicycles are part of traffic and deserve space on our roads. Municipalities know what their residents are asking for, and it\u2019s safer streets. There\u2019s still time for the province to do the right thing for Ontarians, and to pull back from this outrageous over-reach and withdraw this uninformed and dangerous bill.\n"

        "comment": "I am 69 years old.  I cycle for health, for socializing and, often to raise funds for charities, like Princess Margaret Hospital's Ride to Conquer Cancer.\nI do not use my bike for commuting but this legislation threatens my safety and the safety of all law-abiding cyclist in the province.\nThere is already a small percentage of drivers who believe bicycles have no right to be on the road.  It is not unusual for these drivers to \"buzz\" me by passing dangerously close.  Often this happens on quiet country roads where there is little or no traffic.  This legislation, complete with its Orwellian gas-lighting title, serves only to confirm to the view of some car drivers that they 'own' the road and that cyclists are a nuisance at best, targets at worst.  The message will only encourage those who hate cyclists and likely add to their number.  This legislation puts a target on the backs of all cyclists, no matter where they are.\nThis government seems intent on taking care of its friends, while wasting money and time on bad ideas, rather than responding to real needs.\n"

        "comment": "I would like to register my opposition to this Bill. The province needs to listen to the traffic Consultants. I have not heard that there is any data showing that bike lanes inhibit the movement of vehicular traffic and no experts to my knowledge have come out in favour of removing bike lanes. The provincial government should focus on the real issue of road congestion which in Toronto at least is the disgraceful lack of public transit. Get the Eglinton Crosstown operational! (why hasn't anyone at Metrolinx been held responsible!)......and forget Hwy 413, that is only Doug Ford's gift to the developers of urban sprawl that have bought up all the land along that route. It will do nothing to relieve congestion....again ask the experts! A better use of money would be for the province to buy the underused Hwy 407 and remove the tolls or mandate all the transport trucks to use the 407 rather than the 401. And don't get me started on Rob's tunnel under the 401! If he can't get the current projects finished how would he ever expect to get that built? Lets act like a real world class city and get more subways built and more bike lanes built. They can do it in Europe...why not here? Lets work towards a liveable city!\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my concerns about Bill 212, particularly its impact on cycling safety and municipal autonomy.\nWhile I understand the importance of addressing traffic congestion and expediting infrastructure projects, the provisions requiring provincial approval for new bike lanes and the potential removal of existing ones raise significant safety concerns. Bike lanes are essential for protecting cyclists, reducing traffic conflicts, and promoting sustainable transportation.\nRestricting municipalities\u2019 ability to manage local bike lanes undermines efforts to create safer and more inclusive roads. Cycling infrastructure benefits everyone by improving traffic flow and reducing environmental impact. Removing these protections would not only discourage active transportation but also increase the risk of accidents.\nI urge you to reconsider the provisions related to bike lanes in Bill 212 and ensure that cycling safety remains a priority in Ontario\u2019s transportation policies.\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\nSincerely,\nEmily\n"

        "comment": "This idea is outrageous! Adding more traffic lanes is a temporary solution. Everyone knows that. Adding more roads and highways adds temporary relief, but encourages more people to drive. The Ford Government ONLY cares about his rich buddies getting obscene amounts of money for building infrastructure that solves nothing. Just like beer and wine in corner stores! What we need is high speed trains on dedicated tracks.. NOT shared with the antiquated tracks already overpopulated with freight trains. European and Asian Countries get it! 400+ km/hr trains moving the entire Country efficiently. Having a single person driving a huge box of overpriced metal around is no solution! Electric or gas doesnt matter. Still a huge issue for infrastructure. Encouraging that is no solution! dedicated mass transit that's fast, reliable and safe! that's what we need. Not a tunnel under the 401! Get cars off the roads. Leave the bike lanes there.. add more even. encourage less traffic not more!\n"

This has been an issue for 40 years. New roads and highways have been built to \"accommodate\" this old way of thinking. It's like Pavlov and his psychology experiment by conditioning to get the same result. It's time to invest to carry a larger number of commuters at a time to get a different result.\n"

For bikes only, stop lights become stop signs, and stop signs become yield signs.  This would keep the flow of traffic moving much better and eliminate the build up of cyclists waiting at a red light keeping motorists from being able to turn right on a red.  Overall everyone wins.\n"

        "comment": "I own a vehicle and use public transit, but my prime choice of transportation is by bicycle. I ride all-year around.  There are many reasons for this: 1) My personal health: be it through the extra daily activitiy, or the fresh air vs sharing the air with many people on transit. 2) The environment - anything I can do to reduce emissions / energy use. 3) It's often faster.  4) It's the cheapest option - while I can afford other options - not everyone can.\nJust today, I rode 8 kms of the Danforth and Bloor street bike lanes with my 10-year-old step-daughter to drop her off at her day-camp and then head into the office myself. She is a great bike rider and fully aware of her surroundings, but this is not a journey we could have made if it were not for the additional safety that bike lanes provide. These are the very same bike lanes that are subject to removal in Bill 212.\nIt's true - the bike lanes are not ideal in terms of safety- we still ride extremely cautiously and I'm constantly reminding her to be vigilant of all the cars we share the road with. But - they are certainly better than no bike lanes! In fact, we are lucky to live in an area with bike lanes that enable us to bike as much as we do. More bike lanes are needed, not fewer, so that more people can take advantage of the benefits of commuting by bicycle.\nIn addition, a lot of city planning and city funding has gone into the creation of these bike lanes. It is a waste of our money to remove them when they serve an invaluable service.\nRegardless of whether removing the bikelanes would actually improve vehicular travel time, I do not think any amount of time savings is worth the increased risk to the safety of the people that use the bike lanes.\nKate\n"

Cars do not look carefully for bikers or walkers and it is not very safe unless there is clearly divided bike lane. The bike lanes that do exist have opened up many more opportunities for safe biking and it is so sad to think they may disappear.\nHere are some other points and issues with the bill.\n- The scope of the legislation extends province-wide and the risks include the politicization and polarization of bike lanes\n- This new omnibus highway Bill will fast-track the construction of Highway 413 by exempting provincial environmental assessments\n- Bill 212 restricts where new bike lanes can be built\n- An addendum to the framework will require the province to remove sections of the Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue bike lanes in the City of Toronto and return them to a lane of traffic for motor vehicles\n-If passed, Bill 212 will provide the province with the authority to establish a review process on other existing bike lanes\n"

The removal of bike lanes will increase the need for cars transportation, which not only harms the environment but ultimately results in more vehicle traffic. We have seen time and time again that adding more lanes to drive in does not result in a long term reduction in travel time, and only a temporary one. Additionally, fast-tracking the Highway 413 project through environmental assessments will only bring negative results, as the environment is the backbone of our economy, without which no other economic activities are possible. We cannot throw caution to the wind when it comes to the environment, and must make sure our activities integrate with it as smoothly as possible, and avoid habitat destruction at all costs.\n"

Productivity matters, infrastructure matters, our environment matters.\nWe don\u2019t need more highways, we need to use the road infrastructure we already have. We need additional transit, something that this government has invested in transit, but even more is needed.\nBike lanes are also needed, to move everyone faster. Congestion is because there are too many vehicles on the road, and a ton of construction in the city. The bike lanes could probably be improved, but leave that to the city of Toronto. And definitely don\u2019t remove the bike lanes that are doing so much to make this city move.\nAs is, this Bill is going to do so much damage to the province. Please cancel it and use a more productive approach that will actually make this province better.\n"
