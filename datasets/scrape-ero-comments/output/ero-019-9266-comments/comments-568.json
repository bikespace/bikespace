        "comment": "Bill 212 is a farce. Doug Ford is trying to MAKE ME UNSAFE biking to school so that he doesn\u2019t have to drive next to bike lanes on his way to work (when he actually goes to work, which is less than a 100 days a year).\nThis bill is an obvious distraction, red meat for the SUV-driving, bike-hating suburbanite Conservative base, so that they will forget about the fact that their six kids will never own a home. Decades of research from around the world and right here in Toronto show that adding bike lanes reduces gridlock. By removing them, this bill literally does the opposite of what is in its name.\nI urge you to see reason. Since I\u2019m not sure you are capable on your own, I\u2019ve laid out those reasons here:\n1. The province should listen to local governments, they have done the research that shows bike lanes reduce congestion.\n2. The province should not be meddling in what are clearly municipal affairs. This sort of petty meddling is such a waste of Ontarians\u2019 tax dollars. We need the province to focus on doing ANYTHING about building affordable housing that benefits Ontarians, not Doug Ford\u2019s mobster developer buddies.\n3. The province should not be adding red tape and bureaucracy that will slow down and increase the cost of municipal business, it should be removing red tape so that we can build affordable housing.\n4. I use the Bloor St. bike lane every day to get to school. Bike lanes are essential infrastructure like sidewalks and roads. They are most useful when they are contiguous, uninterrupted routes divided from the road by physical barriers. If you break them up into pieces, they will not be as useful or safe. If Doug Ford\u2019s drive to work involved multiple sections where he had to drive through an open field, I don\u2019t think he would find that acceptable. Similarly, bike lanes that just end, leaving cyclists on the road, are not a good solution.\n5. When I do drive, I prefer cyclists be in a bike lane with a physical barrier. It just feels safer for everyone. If the bike lanes are removed, people will still ride on Bloor, Yonge and University, they will just do so in a less safe way.\n6. Bike lanes support the transit investments that the province and municipality have made, allowing more people easier access to stations.\n7. Tearing up bike lanes is a colossal waste of money. Why not spend that money on more inflationary cheques to Ontarians to pay for their votes in the next provincial election instead?\nI demand that this bill be IMMEDIATELY RIPPED UP and thrown in the trash bin where it belongs. I would also encourage Doug Ford to resign so that he can focus on fighting the various corruption charges he will soon be facing in court when the RCMP concludes their investigation into his Greenbelt scandal.\n"

        "comment": "I've lived in Toronto for 17 years, and my partner and I have always used cycling as our primary transportation. Until the recent major construction wave, we also frequently used TTC and taxis, but we now find cycling is always the fastest way to get from point to point in the core. We aren't recreational cyclists and we have some health issues, so we only use protected lanes--the University and Bloor lanes multiple times daily (and the Yonge lanes infrequently). The planned demolition very narrowly and specifically harms our personal interests like no legislation I've seen in my time here.\nI also have no reason to think the demolitions will stop with the three currently designated lanes; based on the harsh language being used, I expect the province to eventually remove all protected bike lanes, and possibly also dedicated streetcar rights-of-way. And in the medium to long term, beyond the issue of bike lanes, I expect the broad application of punitive Michigan-style emergency management regimes to cause severe economic decline in cities across Ontario. In particular, high-skill/high-wage businesses will have trouble recruiting in politically unstable cities unable to make basic municipal planning decisions, and those that can move operations to a province offering their employees a higher quality of life will do so.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes in Toronto's downtown core is a terrible idea. I personally know three cyclists killed on our roads. I see motorists driving dangerously, on their cell phones and speeding every day without any apparent enforcement. Bike lanes save lives. Construction vehicles are often blocking traffic. A better idea would be to allow large trucks into the city at night, like most large cities in Europe. This would certainly help alleviate gridlock. On that note I have seen cement truck running reds way past when it is safe to do so and pedestrians have entered the intersection. With all the condos going up there will only be more and more cars on the road and increased gridlock. Build better transit (finish the Eglinton Crosstown!) and make the roads safer for ALL taxpayers.\n"

Given the change to prevent land owners from requesting a date change under the expropriations act would not be allowed for new highway is rediculous. It's their land, they should be allowed to keep it.\nI am not supportive of highway 413. Studies have shown this will do little or nothing to improve congestion. It will continue to remove and impact valuable green space in our province. Focus on building public transit options that can reduce the need for cars, reducing the need for more highways and improving the environment as well.\nOr better yet, put more money into health care to bring in more family doctors and nurses.\n"

        "comment": "I'm not going to bother sending another email that gets into the debate of whether bike lanes are \"bad\" or \"good.\" I am going to speak as a Toronto taxpayer.\nRegulate new bike lanes as you see fit. But the proposal to \"rip out\" cycling infrastructure that has already been built and paid for is an egregiously irresponsible use of taxpayer money in a city and province where much more urgent problems exist. It will not be assuaged by a $200 tax rebate cheque.\nIf the provincial government is so adamant about throwing good tens of millions of dollars after bad, then the provincial government can transfer responsibility for Bloor, Yonge and University to the province, as was done with the Gardiner Expressway. Then they can explain to constituents in the rest of the province why their tax dollars are being used to rebuild roads in Toronto that the city just finished rebuilding.\nOr Doug Ford can heed the advice he's given to the likes of Justin Trudeau, Bonnie Lysyk, and Taylor Swift: Stay in your lane.\n"

This is a waste of money to rip out NEW bike lanes and an overreach of provincial powers. If grid lock is an issue, speed up repairs on the TTC that carry more people so fewer people need to drive. Additionally, many cyclists have died from inadequate drivers and lack of protected lanes. All we get is, \"I'm sorry\" and we move on.\n"

Traffic in Toronto exists because there are too many cars and the problems on Bloor, etc existed before the bicycle lanes were installed.

        "comment": "As a commuter who bikes to work from the east end to Union station via the Danforth/Bloor bike lanes, I wholeheartedly disagree with this proposal. It is extremely short sighted and a step backwards from an environmental standpoint to think that removing bike lanes will reduce traffic congestion. Instead of biking, what will all those cyclists then do? They won't all be walking, I can assure you of that. Either adding to the overcrowded transit system, or to the overcrowded roads in cars. Or biking in the roads without a bike lane but endangering their lives, with possible accidents adding to traffic slowdowns. And what about all the Uber eats and other food delivery ebikes? While I have separate thoughts on ebikes in general, they help to support our economy and move food throughout the city without a car.\nI am extremely disappointed with this proposal. Stay out of it - provincial government shouldn't be poking it's nose here where it doesn't belong.\n"

Having the bike lanes increases the safety for BOTH drivers and cyclists. It is not the bike lanes that are causing traffic congestion. It is the construction. If the Premier actually drove on these roads, he would know this is the case. Getting rid of these bike lanes will both cost a lot of money and reduce safety for myself and my family as cyclists. Please DO NOT get rid of them.\n"

        "comment": "Every bike on a bike lane, one less car. Improving congestion. Spending 45 million of our tax dollars to take out bike lanes is a waste, while people are struggling to make ends meet. Bike friendly cities boost the economy. I\u2019m Danish Canadian, the Danes invested in bike infrastructure in the 1970s, and like many great cities in the US and around the world are leaders and investors in a stronger economy. Ontario\u2019s goal should be the best in the world not the worst, and improve our economy with more tourism and better traffic flow while our population grows.\nIn a modern world with an abundance of fast, motorized options for transportation, the humble bicycle is experiencing a boom not seen in the U.S. since the 1970s.\nAmericans rediscovered the bicycle during the pandemic as they looked for safe, socially distant forms of exercise, recreation, and transportation. Bike sales surged, and retailers struggled to keep up with demand.\nThree years later, Americans are still pedaling in high gear while other pandemic fads have fallen flat. In 2022, U.S. consumers spent $8.2 billion on bicycles and accessories \u2014 up from $6.9 billion in 2020.\n1. Copenhagen\nThe Lowdown: The numbers make things easy: 62 percent of inhabitants\u2019 trips to work or school are by bike. Copenhageners cycle 894,000 miles every day. More than $45 per capita in bicycle infrastructure investments. Four bicycle bridges built or under construction. One hundred and four miles of new regional cycle highways\n"

This is being vindictive. People will die because of this. Blood is already on this conservative governments hands. You serve the people. It\u2019s not even proven that adding an extra lane helps traffic. In fact, if anyone here ever learned how to read, reading any paper by urban planners or researchers in this field would demonstrate adding a lane would simply induce demand and make the traffic situation worse.\nFurther, being able to take our land for a construction project is super illegal. When the rcmp finish the greenbelt investigation and then jump to this, I hope you folks face prison time. As you should.\n"

Not only is it a waste of money -- both the money spent to install them and the money spent to take them out -- it can not be expected to meaningfully reduce congestion on those very busy streets, and it will only make accidents and fatalities of cyclists even more common than they already are.\nWhat we need to be doing is making Toronto more livable for people without a car. If people are better able to get around by bike or mass transit options, they won't need to rely on cars to get everywhere.\nThis proposal is short-sighted, wasteful, destructive, and dangerous.\n"

It's a complete waste of money, money that could be better spent on things like: transit projects, green energy or health care.\nIf the conservative government forces through this outrageous reversal, they should at least fund it through a new revenue stream, like city congestion charges, road tolls or a tax on all commercial vehicles that have flooded the roads since tech began delivering everything to our homes.\nSincerely,\nToronto resident\n"

        "comment": "I disagree wholeheartedly with the stated \"objectives/Truths\" about what the province needs. I comment on each below. I firmly disagree with wasting taxpayer money to remove existing bike lanes. With younger Ontarians waiting or skipping getting a drivers license, lanes for bikes and e-bikes are becoming more important - NOT LESS.  Go to the best functioning cities in the world and they all focus on public transit and bike traffic in their cores.\n1) Recognizes the need to build priority highways faster as our province grows in order to get people and goods out of gridlock and save drivers and businesses time and money.\n- We have enough highways. They are poorly managed for truck traffic. Change fees the 407 to incentivize trucks to bypass the 401 and qew.  Cancel the 413 - this is a waste of money that should be spent on healthcare.\n2) Recognizes that accidents and lane closures can worsen traffic congestion and impact the quality of life of Ontarians.\n- Bike lanes prevent accidents and road closures.\n3) Is speeding up the delivery of broadband projects that will connect people in all parts of Ontario, including rural areas, with reliable internet access.\n- Not related to bike lanes or highway construction and therefore not relevant.\n4) Is building Highway 413, recognizing the importance of this highway to millions of drivers from across Ontario.\n- This highway in not important to most drivers and will not improve GTA gridlock. It is too far north to make an impact. It further undermines and endangers the environmentally crucial 905 greenbelt and wastes tax payer money.  This point should be restated that the Ford government prioritizes high visibility and expensive projects that are simple for the administration to explain and align with their political supporters business interests in construction and real estate . Sadly this means healthcare will never be a priority because as a public sector with complex systems, it is too much for the Ford Government to handle.\n"

It won't allow another car lane to open, so why? Its an awful idea. Lastly, biking is important to help combat climate change.
