        "comment": "I fully support this legislation.  The municipal government of Toronto has acted irresponsibly.\nMy recommendations are in two stages:  the complete removal of bicycle lanes on Bloor (and Danforth,) University, and Yonge; or, if this is impractical, a staged removal of bicycles lanes in areas where they are clearly damaging traffic flow.\nI fully support bicycle lanes where they make sense.  On my commute, I encounter them on Annette and Harbord, and fully appreciate their effectiveness on those street.\nThey do not make sense where a) there is off-street parking and b) where there is a subway line.\nI must also point out how dangerous bicycle lanes are, in complete disagreement with the arguments from bicycle-lane advocates.  Anyone driving on Bloor Street, and, more importantly, trying to park on Bloor Street, knows that it is inherently dangerous for bicyclists to be in such close proximity to traffic.  Bicycle lanes give untrained cyclists the false illusion of safety.  They are not safe.  Because they believe they are, or have adopted the attitude that they have more rights than motorists, they do stupid things, like veering into traffic to avoid obstacles.  There will always be illegal parking in bicycle lanes on busy commercial throughways.  There will always be cyclists veering out of bicycle lanes.  In addition, the new form of parking on Bloor Street forces motorists exiting their cars to open their doors into traffic.  The amount of space is razor-thin.\nIf full removal is not practical, at least remove the lanes from Bloor Street West of Keele, or at least West of Jane.  In the west end, where I live, parking is off-street.  In areas where parking is on-street, for most of the day, the traffic flows on one lane anyway, so the addition of bicycle lanes affects traffic only in rush hour.  I also strongly advocate removal on University Avenue, where emergency vehicles are greatly impeded by these lanes.  Both Bloor and University are streets where I drive regularly, so I can say without hesitation that these bicycles lanes are largely unused even in good weather.  In the winter, they are completely unused.  I cannot comment on Yonge Street or the Danforth, as I do not travel there.\nPlease act quickly to make Toronto a better place to live.\n"

        "comment": "I work as a nurse at Sick Kids Hospital on University Avenue, and I frequently bike to work on the cycle tracks on hospital row. On my commute to work, I pass a white memorial bike to mark the spot where cyclists have died after being struck by vehicles. I am very disappointed that the province is trying to remove these bike lanes that help me and many other people travel safely, all to slightly improve car travel times. Even though I don\u2019t drive, I wish that my provincial government cared about my safety over the convenience of the apparently more important drivers, who are prioritized first. As well, it would be helpful if this act was based on true data, which has shown that traffic has not worsened and that emergency response times are not longer. At work, I see children who have been injured riding their bikes after being struck by car and truck drivers. This act says to me that these children\u2019s safety is an afterthought, and not important when compared to car traffic times. I hope that the province will reconsider this act and prioritize all citizens, not just car drivers.\n"

        "comment": "Hello I just wanted to voice my opinion on the removal of bike lanes. I understand the logic of widening the roads in order to improve traffic lanes however it is counterproductive. By widening roads we will actually be introducing more car traffic instead of reducing it. The more people see a way to use their car the more cars will be used thus increasing traffic once again. Instead of putting in efforts to have more cars on the roads of an already congested city, we should be focusing on better public transportation or alternatives means of travel such as cycling or even scooters. If we have the proper infrastructure to accommodate other modes of transportation it will help lessens the need of motor vehicles which will help lessen car traffic. An already congested city does not need more cars to further congested it. So I would like to urge Municipalities and Provincial legislators to reconsider removing bike lanes and instead promote alternative means of transportation.\n"

Traffic studies have shown that congestion improves on streets with bike lanes as more people move away from using cars.\nOne of the lanes that sights have been set on are the brand new lanes on University Ave, which provide a critical north-south bike connection in Toronto. Tearing them out now would be an insane waste of time and money to appease people that don't even live downtown. People, including myself, rely on these lanes to get around the city.\nSo much good progress on cycling infrastructure has been made, it would be a shame to get rid of it all.\nThis is ridiculous.\n"

        "comment": "Removing existing bike lanes, or restricting construction of future bike lanes will make gridlock worse. Global studies show that traffic congestion is reduced with the addition of bike lanes. Removing bike lanes will make traffic worse, as well as making cycling vastly more dangerous.\nThe only way to reduce traffic congestion is to have excellent alternatives to cars. The only way to have fewer cars on the road is to make it more convenient and appealing to choose other modes of transportation. Every major city requres high quality mass transit options, as well as safe and well designed networks of bicycle lanes, and pedestrian friendly infrastructure.\nThis proposal is outrageous, and will only worsen the problems it is claiming to address. We are in the midst of a climate crisis as well as a cost of living crisis, and this proposal will make it even more difficult and dangerous to choose environmentally friendly and more affordable modes of transit.\n"

Biking is an environmentally-friendly transport alternative, that improves population health both directly and indirectly.\nFurthermore, the Province is looking to implement bike lane reduction/limitation in clear contradiction of evidential data and expert planners viewpoints. The decision to ignore evidence and force province-wide rule changes is perplexing. The Province of Ontario should not be prioritizing the personal feelings of politicians who like to drive, over the bodily safety of the 9.8 million Ontarians who cycle every month, and the needs of municipalities with 50 year development plans.\nI do not support the passage of this bill.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes (that the city recently paid for) to add more lanes for cars is not a good policy. We have surrendered much of our walkable city space to cars already, as the roads continue to become increasingly dangerous to people choosing not to drive. These bike lanes are heavily used and this legislation will force them to use cars (as there is no other viable alternative. Biking on sidewalks or sharing the road with cars is so incredibly dangerous for cyclists). Study after study has shown for years that adding car lanes simply induces more demand and gridlock continues. Biking reduces emissions and carbon footprint, promotes a healthier lifestyle, and decreases grid lock by giving people viable alternative means of commute. This is entirely backwards. We need more alternative means of transportation, not less. Not funding public transportation expansions, removing existing infrastructure, and pouring money into new highways is entirely backwards. This forces people to purchase cars as no other safe means of transportation exist, adding further financial burdens to families.\n"

Not to mention the endless construction. There are too many impediments to vehicular traffic in the city of Toronto and there should absolutely be provincial oversight in this area. Toronto is a business hub for the entire province and as a commuter who drives into this city for work, I think this is an important bill. I support bill 212.\n"

The idea that this decision could contribute to any social good is laughable, and the decision to claw back recently-created bike lanes will cost taxpayers twice, amortizing the work against the province's coffers \u2013\u00a0how can anybody support this?

More and more people are riding every year. How are bike lanes responsible for increase congestion on the 401, or the 400?\nThis is far outside of the province's jurisdiction, a big overreach of powers. Let cities decide what to do with their space - the purpose of a city isn't to make it as convenient as possible for a driver to pass through it.\n"

        "comment": "There is no evidence that active transportation lanes cause traffic congestion. The reverse is true: fewer commuters using cars (by using active transportation) take cars off the road.  Whereas adding another vehicular lane to a road, does not ease congestion as it just encourages more drivers to take advantage of the extra lane. Also, by having segregated bike lanes this keeps vehicles and active transportation users in their own lane, so that drivers driving 40+ km/h would not be slowed down by cyclists riding 20 km/h. Furthermore, by having less segregated bike lanes, this will encourage cyclists to ride on sidewalks, now we all are pedestrians at some point or another and we do not want more bikes and scooters on sidewalks.\nThese false claims divide us. By delaying the construction of protected lanes for vulnerable road users, and intruding in municipal jurisdiction, we miss the opportunity to prioritize safety for all road users. More preventable tragedies will happen.  Also, this will increase bureaucracy and red tape as municipal councillors would have to apply to a provincial board to seek approval of a bike lane.  We should be able to trust our municipal councillors that they will take due diligence in speaking with their communities and participate in active consultation when they decide to build a segregated bike lane on a road. When you ran for provincial office, you campaigned on less government and less red tape.\nMore and more people are making use of active transportation to commute to work, buy groceries, do errands, go to social events.  There are all kinds of active transportation, such as regular bikes,\ne-bikes, cargo bikes, scooters, tricycles, mobility scooters etc. And these users are becoming are more apparent on the road. Bikes and other forms of active transportation are not just used for recreational purpose.\nAs Premier Ford once said on a televised bike ride in 2017, vulnerable road users are at risk without protected infrastructure. We must ensure their safety.\nDo not introduce legislation that will only ensure more tragedies. I await your commitment to use evidence-based policy that protects all road users.\nLet\u2019s embrace a \u201cVision Zero\u201d approach in Ontario that ensures everyone is safe. You can unite us towards that worthy goal.\n"

        "comment": "Comment on the Proposed Bill Restricting Bike Lanes in Ontario\nI am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed bill that would grant the provincial government authority to block the installation of new bike lanes and remove existing ones on municipal roads, especially when it involves the removal of a vehicle lane. This legislation is a misguided approach that overlooks the multifaceted benefits of bike lanes and undermines municipal autonomy.\nIneffectiveness in Improving Traffic Flow\nContrary to the belief that removing bike lanes will enhance traffic flow, evidence suggests otherwise. Bike lanes encourage more people to opt for cycling over driving, effectively reducing the number of cars on the road. This shift not only alleviates traffic congestion but also maximizes the efficiency of existing road space. Eliminating bike lanes would likely force cyclists back into cars or unsafe riding conditions, increasing traffic volume and negating any perceived benefits of additional vehicle lanes.\nSafety Concerns for All Road Users\nBike lanes are essential for the safety of both cyclists and motorists. They provide a designated space for cyclists, reducing the likelihood of accidents and conflicts between different types of road users. Removing these lanes increases the risk of collisions, injuries, and fatalities. Safety should be a paramount concern, and this bill compromises that by making roads more hazardous for everyone.\nEnvironmental Impact\nEncouraging cycling through the provision of bike lanes contributes significantly to environmental sustainability. Bicycles produce zero emissions, and increasing their use helps reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. In the face of growing concerns about climate change, policies should promote environmentally friendly transportation options rather than diminish them.\nHealth and Well-being Benefits\nCycling is not just a mode of transportation; it is also a form of physical exercise that promotes health and well-being. By making cycling safer and more accessible, bike lanes encourage a healthier lifestyle among residents. Removing these lanes could discourage physical activity, leading to negative public health outcomes and increased healthcare costs in the long run.\nEconomic Advantages\nCities with robust cycling infrastructure often experience economic benefits. Local businesses can see increased patronage from cyclists who are more likely to stop and shop than motorists. Additionally, the costs associated with road maintenance can decrease due to reduced wear and tear from fewer vehicles. Eliminating bike lanes could, therefore, have unintended negative economic consequences.\nErosion of Municipal Autonomy\nMunicipalities have a better understanding of their local needs and priorities. Granting the province authority over bike lane installations undermines local governance and disregards the input of community members who advocate for safer, more sustainable transportation options. This overreach sets a concerning precedent for provincial interference in municipal affairs.\nConclusion\nThe proposed bill is a step backward for Ontario\u2019s transportation, environmental, and public health goals. It fails to consider the comprehensive benefits that bike lanes offer and instead opts for a short-sighted solution that will not improve traffic conditions. I urge policymakers to reconsider this legislation and focus on enhancing, rather than diminishing, cycling infrastructure for the betterment of all residents.\n"
