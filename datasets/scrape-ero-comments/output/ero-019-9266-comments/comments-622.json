        "comment": "Removal of existing bike lanes is the height of absurdity, never mind a ridiculous overreaching of the Province's jurisdiction. As a citizen of Toronto and a tax-payer, I object to the time, energy, and tax dollars that will be used to remove bike lanes on busy areas of Bloor, University and Yonge. As a pedestrian, I feel safer with the bike lanes in place because I can more easily keep track of both bicycles and cars when they are confined to their restricted areas. Cars create congestion, not bike lanes!\nI also object to provincial departments overturning decisions that the City of Toronto had made at considerable expense for what appears like the flimsiest of reasons.\nI have no faith in the Ontario government and its current Premier. Their previous decisions about the Ontario Science Centre and Ontario Place are equally shameful.\n"

        "comment": "I have been a cyclist in this city before all the at risk bike lanes where in place and I have first hand experience in how dangerous it is to cycle anywhere in the city that doesn't have a bike lane. The bike lanes have made it so I am able to safely get around the city without driving, to the benefit of the environment, my health and the traffic. I often don't bike if the road doesn't have a bike lane, so to rip them out would just put more people like me back in my car or on the TTC, adding to traffic congestion-the opposite of what you are intended to do. I am also a driver and appreciate driving on roads that have bike lanes because it safer for driving. NOT TO MENTION this proposed bill will statistically KILL more people, AND PUTS MY LIFE AT RISK. Bike deaths are far too common and the bill will result in the death of cyclist and harm to drivers. This bill needs to be reconsidered deeply.\n"

        "comment": "I am very unhappy with Doug Ford's intrusion into the City's affairs related to the bike lanes.   We have a local democratically elected government that we, Torontonians, voted into office.   Mayor Chow ran on a bike-friendly ticket and won the election and implemented bike-friendly policies.\nNow you are interfering in what is obviously a local matter.   The City has done a lot of consultations and homework in setting up a network of bike lanes, and if you look at them those lanes are  now being heavily used.  Including on major streets.  The amount of bike traffic has gone up exponentially.\nTo create this valuable multi-modal transportation, a lot of effort and money were spent.  The construction efforts to retool streets like Bloor Street involved inconvenience and temporary disruptions to residents and businesses.  But it was worth it, now we have an excellent network.   Now you want everyone to be inconvenienced by another level of government arbitrarily coming in to rip it up.   And you want Toronto taxpayers to pay for that. (again)  How much money, time and inconvenience are we talking about here based on what seems to be a whim?\nYour talking points in support of your overreach seem to run along these lines:  \"there are lots of cars in Ontario\".\nSo what?  Obviously those cars are not going to all fit on Bloor Street. The City has been investing in a more walkable, bikable downtown rather than a highway-like downtown.  That is a local decision and you should withdraw this legislation immediately.\n"

People who live in Toronto should not have to pay to get back in. The high number of cars are from the 905 area and often single people in a huge car.  Force them onto the Go train.  Improve public transit, improve Go trains.\n"

        "comment": "The bike lanes are built and, in most areas,  being used.  They provide a safer , alternate way to get around the city not just for cyclists but for those who use wheel chairs or other assistive devices. Not everyone can afford a car nor do those of us who live downtown want one.  If you look at other jurisdictions, the usuals will improve over time.\nAs a pedestrian, I do NOT want to drive the bikes back onto the sidewalks. The bike lanes protect pedestrians as well as cyclists.\nYou need to encourage people to leave their cars at home and to use alternate transportation methods.  Perhaps consider getting some other transportation methods completed.  We\u2019ve waited 14 years for the Crosstown! Completing projects and coordinating construction will do far more to reduce congestion than ripping up existing bike lanes.\nAlso, we do not need more attractions downtown.  They attack more cars.  We have enough and do not need spas with giant parking lots.    Leave the Science Centre where it is.  That neighbourhood, needs attractions, jobs and educational opportunities.\nFinally, to remove any existing bike lanes is a total waste of money.\n"

No city of Toronto\u2019s size anywhere in the world can  rely on cars as the way a majority or even a large minority  of the population commutes to the city centre. There are too many people for this to work without constant gridlock. Therefore, all efforts to reduce congestion should be focussed on making it easier for people to travel on foot, by bike or on public transit. Finishing the Eglinton and Finch LRT lines would be a good start.\n"

This provision clearly undermines Ontarians right to their property and due process in any expropriation thereby. What is the point of having an expropriation act if the government feels free to create ways to avoid abiding by it. Ontarians deserve a government that will protect their property and not use shady loopholes like this to benefit corporate allies and their own agendas.\n"

I am concerned about our environment and am thankful to have designated bike lanes that allow me to ride in in the city, with my kids, and remain safe.\nRemoving bike lanes is a step backward. Our city needs to be investing in environmentally friendly methods of transportation, not destroying the hard fought and rightly instated bike lanes that the citizens of Toronto need and deserve.\nI think we should start tolling commuters that drive into our city from neighbouring communities like Pickering, Newmarket, Mississauga. They use our roads and don't pay taxes to fix them. Why is this okay? I live here! I pay taxes here! I want more bike lanes and less cars in the city!\nI vote to keep the bike lanes and get rid of Ford instead!\n"

        "comment": "A few years ago, Premier Ford acknowledged how much safer it was to cycle using bike lanes. Why he has suddenly decided that they should be ripped out is a mystery. The lanes make things safer for cyclists AND motorists, as the latter don't have to worry so much about where the cyclists are. As a regular cyclist, I can't tell you how much better things have been since the City of Toronto began to expand their bike lane program. Is downtown traffic rather snarled at present? It is, but that's in large part thanks to big (and eventually beneficial) infrastructure projects related to the expansion of public transit that should eventually - like the bike lanes - reduce the number of cars on Toronto's streets. All to the good, and much thanks to the province for contributing to public transit.\nPlease Premier, let the province worry about the highways and leave it to the municipalities to establish how best to keep their local people safe on municipal roads. Local problems are best left to local government. Thanks.\n"

        "comment": "This reads a lot like an omnibus bill. You are including a lot of unrelated issues, connected to cycle lanes but not restricted to them, and that is really alarming and manipulative. I fear this is concealing initiatives yet to be discussed or approved. Yes, traffic needs to flow. No, bikes should not be banished nor routes made unsafe. It's possible to have both bikes (even electric ones) and cars co-exist, if rules are established. We need some updated traffic laws to deal with this technological change. And we need to ensure that everyone on the road lives by the same rules, including cyclists and motorized vehicles of every stripe. Train and licence them all!\nBuilding more roads is NOT the answer. That includes the infamous 413 Highway, a totally unneeded route. Tunnels aren't needed either, but we do need the 407 back in public hands as a 401 bypass route. We need to use better what we already have.\n"

The removal of bike lanes is a big step backwards and I don\u2019t support it. I am a cyclist and I don\u2019t want to feel more unsafe on the streets because there is not proper cycling infrastructure. It\u2019s classist to favour cars over public transportation, cycling and pedestrian infrastructure. It is also not appropriate from a governance perspective for the province to be making these kinds of infrastructure decisions within municipalities.\n"

        "comment": "I'm 67 years old and have lived and biked in downtown Toronto for 40 years. Biking, walking and TTC are my primary modes of transportation. I don't own a car and rent only when necessary. When I started riding here it often felt risky, but very slowly the biking infrastructure improved and more and more people started biking. Unfortunately the number of cars downtown skyrocketed and the frustration of getting across town has resulted in a lot of aggressive and dangerous driving. Last night on College at Ossington, where there is no bike lane, I was almost hit by a speeding van who pulled an incredibly risky stunt to pass a streetcar. I wear a helmet. I signal when I turn. I stop at streetlights to let car drivers know not all bikes ignore lights. The food delivery guys are generally a nuisance, but they use the lanes to do their job and people rely on them to do it quickly. I use bike lanes everytime I ride. I feel safe on them. Our 11 year old son rides with my wife and I and if there's no convenient bike lane we will change our destination. I've heard many of the businesses on Bloor feel they're a positive addition. The $48 million price tag of just removing them is an outrageous waste of our money. That should be put towards something we need - like helping address the homeless situation. We need to encourage people to bike more and the lanes do that. There are too many cars downtown. When we visit cities in Europe the relationship with bikes is so different. Please keep the lanes!!!\n"

        "comment": "I am very opposed to the Government's proposed removal of Toronto's bike lanes. Firstly, it is intrusion into City of Toronto affairs - overreach. I think the province should stay in their lane - not the city's bike lanes. Secondly, I live close to both the Yonge, Danforth, and University bike routes and use them as do my neighbours and friends. I have noticed how busy they are, and wonder what will happen when they are removed - most likely people will be injured, possibly killed. I understand from following the issue, that the Province is using statistics for the GTA for usage, versus the City's statistics which show quite high use (as also evidenced by the wide use of the bike share program.)\nI think bike lanes are an easy scapegoat and \"vote getter\" for Toronto's terrible traffic. Other possible causes - slowness of transit improvements (why is the Crosstown still unfinished, with no date in sight and no accountability!), many more rideshare cars on the road, larger cars taking up more space, and building sites taking out lanes of traffic (e.g. Avenue Road.) And from following urban planning, building more roads = getting more cars. I have just returned from a trip to Europe and saw so much evidence of the BENEFIT of dedicated bikes lanes, and better transit,  and also see the benefits when I visit family in Vancouver.\nOther cities have gridlock. Yes it's a problem but I feel the Province should be focused on other priorities e.g. state of health care (having recently spent 24 hours in a big hospital emergency department with an elderly person who had a hip fracture, on a bed, in the hall!), or the state of the education system - watching the deterioration of some formerly excellent public schools.\nThank you.\n"

        "comment": "I am STRONGLY OPPOSED to the removal/reduction of cycling infrastructure in the city of Toronto. As we continue to evolve to meet the challenges of a growing population with an increased carbon footprint, it is ever more important to encourage a mix of transportation options. A healthy city is one that supports a mix of pedestrian and cycling traffic along with ample, efficient public transit. While cars and other motor vehicles are a necessary part of urban traffic, the longterm goal should be the reduction of private passenger vehicles in the downtown core while improving other means of access.\nOur cycling infrastructure has been growing over the past few years, with many more people now electing to use it for commuting and exercise. Removing parts of the established network would not only lead to additional costs and increased short-term disruption, but it would also result in a decrease in safety for the thousands of cyclists on Toronto's roads. It is challenging for cyclists and cars to safely share lanes on our roadways, and removing the dedicated cycling lanes will not remove the cyclists. They will still be there, competing for space with other, larger vehicles in the lanes of live traffic. Every year, cyclists are killed in traffic, but the existence of separated bike lanes dramatically reduces the risk. If this proposal goes forward, the rate of vehicle/cyclist collisions will see a dramatic increase, along with the injuries and deaths that result.\nAs a resident of the city of Toronto, I implore you not to roll back the gains we've achieved in making cycling safe and accessible in our city. These lanes were approved and installed under the municipal council we elected, who represent us and our priorities for the city we live in. Please allow them to continue improving our infrastructure in fulfillment of the contract we made with them when we cast our votes.\n"

Not only are they a major source of transportation all year round for many Torontonians, they are integral in providing riders a safe way of passage through a busy city. They are also crucial in reducing congestion and improving air quality by keeping cars off the road. The source of congestion is from lanes being closed for the construction of new buildings.\n"
