How can the provincial government understand the specific traffic requirements of a municipality?\nThis proposal is clearly an attempt by Ford to appeal to his base (remember \u2018buck a beer\u2019).\nIt would seem that our premier is more interested in being the mayor of Toronto than politics at the provincial level.\n"

        "comment": "One would think that building more roads with more lanes for cars would reduce congestion, but research shows that's not the case, thanks to something called induced demand. The more traffic lanes that are put in, the more it appeals to people who may not otherwise have chosen to drive, thereby putting more cars on the roads and increasing congestion.\n\"So for a short period of time, there might be a slightly improved [reduction], but within a year or two, or perhaps three, traffic is as bad or worse than it was before the lanes were added in the first place,\" said David Beitel, data services lead at Eco-Counter, a Montreal company that collects and analyzes pedestrian and bicycle traffic data.\nConversely, if you put in more dedicated bike lanes, people tend to feel safer and demand for use increases, said Shoshanna Saxe, an associate professor at the University of Toronto's department of civil and mineral engineering and Canada Research Chair in sustainable infrastructure.\n\"As soon as you build a bike lane, within a year, two years, the latent demand shows up,\" she said.\nBike Share Toronto statistics show that ridership on its network of shared bikes has increased dramatically since 2015, when 665,000 bike trips were made annually. In 2023, that shot up to 5.7 million trips.\n"

As a driver in Toronto (I commute a total of 85 minutes a day), I know that I have to drive much SLOWER when there is a bike in the lane in front of me and not in a dedicated bike lane.\nIf we remove bike lanes, cyclists will clog up the car lanes, and it will be worse.\nPlease keep the bike lanes, and install more! It will make my commute much faster!\n"

        "comment": "It\u2019s disheartening to see proposals for bike lane removals in Toronto. Bike lanes are essential for promoting sustainable transportation, improving safety for cyclists, and reducing congestion. Removing them undermines our efforts to create a greener city and can make our streets more dangerous for everyone. We should be investing in infrastructure that supports all modes of transportation, not rolling back progress. Let\u2019s prioritize safe, accessible streets for all Torontonians!\n"

        "comment": "Where is the research for this? What studies have shown that adding bike lanes increases congestion?\nWhen a lane is \"removed\" to add a bike lane, the total number of travel lanes is the same or higher - but now bikes and cars can ride separately, increasing safety and reducing cars getting stuck behind bikes. When safety increases, more people can bike, decreasing the number of people in cars.\n"

        "comment": "I'm a grade 10 student and I am extremely concerned about this proposed legislation. Because I cannot currently drive, I rely heavily on my parents for transportation. Safe bike infrastructure, the kind that the City of Toronto has been so instrumental in building, is vital to my daily life, and its continued development is important in ensuring that I can continue to travel safely. Restricting the expansion of bike infrastructure is resticting my independence. Removing bike lanes, especially in areas with high demand such as Yonge, Bloor, and University Ave., will only make my life less safe.\nI do not only speak for myself. I speak for the hundreds of students who walk and bike to school in my neighbourhood every day. I speak for the thousands of innocent lives who are killed on our roads every year due to the lack of safe infrastructure. I speak for the millions of people who do not drive, yet still pay for infrastructure that harms them back.\nNot everyone can bike, but EVEN FEWER PEOPLE CAN DRIVE.\n"

        "comment": "I understand that Ontario government is concerned about cities building any bike lanes that would \u201creduce the number of marked lanes available for travel by motor vehicle traffic.\u201d  Cyclists are taxpayers as well as car drivers.  100 cyclists or 100 persons in motor vehicles are equally important when allocating access to our city roadways.  So the government's decision criteria should be \"number of persons able to travel (whether car or bike), and not \"number of lanes available for motor vehicles.\nOntario's goal should not be \"to get drivers where they need to go faster\"; it should be to accommodate the most persons who want to travel, and also to consider the environmental impact of modes of travel that are being accommodated.  You state \"Implications to the environment will be considered as the ministry identifies and develops the criteria\"; you should develop those criteria BEFORE making any changes to the rules concerning bike lanes.\n"

Making these alternatives safe and reliable helps everyone get where they need to go faster, not just drivers.\nBy restricting cycling options, the province will only force cyclists to share the road with drivers. This will inconvenience drivers, but for many cyclists this will be deadly.  I cannot emphasize this enough.\nPlease leave the decisions about local transportation to the municipalities and their constituents who understand it best.\n"

        "comment": "The proposal is nonsensical. This is an extreme overreach by the province. Separated and protected bike lanes are a safe, environmentally friendly, and practical solution to gridlock in the city. Surely, as a driver, bicycles are annoying, and being vigilant on the road is bothersome. What is LESS annoying is when I know that the cyclists have their own lanes.\nWhat would be less annoying, of course, would be for this city to have a public transit infrastructure that isn't embarrassing, and that allows for multiple modes of transportation. But alas, that isn't Toronto. Toronto nearly forces people into a terrible choice: drive everywhere, or take bicycles to get out of the hell that is our traffic....only to be for some reason to be made into scapegoats, and to wonder whether each ride could prove lethal.\nSHAME on the province for this.\n"

To decide what\u2019s best for each city, each neighborhood on a provincial level sounds like they don\u2019t have better things to do. Not a single evidence that this would improve anything, but dozens of studies to support the idea that only good alternatives to car can actually reduce \u201ctraffic\u201d. When Ford and his minions say traffic what they really mean is vehicular traffic, like there\u2019s nothing but the cars. This decision puts cars above anything else and will result in more dangerous roads for everyone while not solving any \u201ctraffic\u201d problems as we know how induced demand works. Shame on this government that pursues popularity instead of doing the right thing. Ontario is degrading the already low quality of life even further.\n"

We should be investing in safe and healthy modes of transportation - improving public transit and making it easier and safer for people to move around a crowded and growing city. Bike lanes have been shown to improve the health of communities and reduce traffic, making it easier to get around. To invest in our future, we should be sure to build a bike lane with every new city road we build.\n"
