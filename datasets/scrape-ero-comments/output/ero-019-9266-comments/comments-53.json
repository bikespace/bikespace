        "comment": "First off, the culture war needs to die; cyclists are still residents of Ontario and are often also drivers. Cyclists just choose to commute on a bike because that's the most efficient way to get around the city, because there's TOO MUCH TRAFFIC. Why do you think removing bike lanes will reduce traffic? Bike lanes get bikes OUT of the way of drivers, preventing cyclists from clogging up lanes either by taking a vehicle or claiming the lane instead. When there are no bike lanes, bikes are legally entitled to take the whole right lane. How slow do you think traffic is going to move then?\nMore importantly, bike lanes literally save LIVES. It is jaw-dropping that you think the possibility of shaving mere minutes off a commute is worth the lives of other citizens who also live in Ontario and who might also drive. \"But wait,\" you claim, \"Put the bike lanes on side streets\". Why do you think city planners put them on major arteries to begin with? Residential side streets discourage traffic, including bike traffic, by design. Toronto is not a perfect grid. It is not only extremely inefficient to put bike lanes on side streets, but the same residents who would oppose having an extra lane of traffic cutting through their neighbourhood are going to oppose the inclusion of bike lanes. If you remove bike lanes from the major streets, you are further jeopardizing an already vulnerable population of road users who are just trying to get to their destination. Their deaths will be on your hands.\n"

        "comment": "I do not think that the provincial government has any place making municipal level decisions about urban planning.\nIf municipalities cannot make informed decisions based on local information we should expect worse outcomes in terms of public safety, the economy, and impacts to the environment.\nSpecifically speaking about Toronto, the city is very dense and urbanized. Personal vehicles are the least space efficient form of transportation the mankind has ever invented. Based on this fact alone it would stand to reason that even if bike lanes took away space from motorists we would expect that this is still a massive net benefit in terms of transportation capacity available to the public.\nThere is absolutely, positively no solution to reduce traffic that does not involve viable alternatives to driving. The Ford government's actions are contrary to this goal and will not achieve improvements in travel time, while simultaneously delivering worse outcomes for public safety and impact to the environment.\nAdditionally, the comments suggesting that bike lanes can simply be relocated to side streets demonstrate a clear lack of understanding of basically anything. Side streets are built with traffic calming measures to keep traffic away from these routes. These same traffic calming measures that make the routes undesirable to drive from point a to point b, have exactly the same impact when cycling. Perhaps the government doesn't understand that most cyclists are doing the same thing drivers are trying to do, that is: getting from where they are to where they need to go. Cyclists are not simply doing something frivolous that need be relegated to the sidelines. None of the routes being discussed for removal of bike lanes have side streets that provide a similarly direct route. If they did, these side streets would likely be choked with vehicles traffic as well.\nI firmly believe this bill is simply intended to be a political wedge issue, and that is reprehensible. I don't believe it is justifiable or acceptable to score political points while gambling with public safety. This bill will kill people.\n"

        "comment": "The bike lanes that have been installed on Danforth Avenue, taking away a vehicle lane has caused chaos, huge congestion. These bike lanes are made with complete neglect as they are for young, physically fit, neuro-typical, able-bodied folks who are privileged. They have caused tremendous barriers to elderly, disabled, neuro-diverse folks - we have no say. These lanes have caused dangerous and unsafe conditions in our neighbourhood - frustration endured by drivers during rush hour congestion causes drivers to veer onto residential streets, spped, run through stop signs - posing unsafe conditions for our children playing outside. Concerned over the ability for emergency vehicles to pass through - there is no room. Cars consistently run through red lights at Woodbine and Danforth intersection - out of sheer frustration sitting in traffic and getting nowhere. There are prohibitions on making right turns at intersections causing a single lane of back-up moving northbound on Woodbine. The lane of traffic going northbound on Woodbine (northeast corner near subway station) is so narrow that buses can hardly fit. It is disasterous and we have complained consistently to our city Councillor who has done nothing, doesn't even respond. City Planners have obviously drawn up these plans for bike lanes without visiting the physical sites and without taking all variables into account. I have a child with autism who will never be able to ride a bike and to get him to swim lessons I need to drive. It is at 5:30 - a pool that is normally a maximum of a 10 minute drive - we have to leave 30 to 45 minutes to get there.\n"

        "comment": "\"Prescribed municipalities would be required to seek provincial approval to allow for the implementation of new bicycle lanes (\u201cbike lanes\u201d) that require the removal of an existing lane of traffic. Approval will be based on a set of specified criteria, to be set out in guidance and/or regulation.\nThe proposed framework would also provide the province with the authority to request municipalities to submit information about existing bike lanes on municipal roads where an existing vehicle lane was removed. If the municipality does not have the required data, the Minister has the authority to compel the municipality to collect the data and provide it to the ministry.\"\nAnd you say you are the government that reduces red tape? This is a make work project to appease your suburban voters who chose to drive into Toronto rather than taking the myriad of public transit options available. You are meddling in the affairs of municipalities that have no provincial jurisdiction. If you want to take over where bike lanes go, how about you also take over all the road maintenance too? You don't need any further statistics, they exist on paper and in reality. You have all the statistics you need from places like BC(Victoria and Vancouver), Montreal, Ottawa, Netherlands, Denmark, Finland to prove that dedicated bike lanes allow vehicle traffic to move better as it reduces the number of vehicles on the road (as more people who like to cycle will feel safer doing so).  It is safer for everyone.  How is adding more layers of approval for a municipal project going to save time and cost? Why should we the residents of Ontario pay for your government to rip out bike lanes(ie Bloor St) because your transportation minister(or should I say motor vehicle minister) wants to drive to work rather than lead by example and take Go Transit?\nRemoving bike lanes or refusing to permit the installation of bike lanes serves one purpose only; to prioritize motor vehicle movement over the safety of anyone else.  So instead of separating bikes from motor vehicles you would rather us ride in traffic? Or on sidewalks(illegal and more dangerous seeing as many sidewalks are too narrow to begin with). You will see more deaths and injuries, you will remove a viable transport option for thousands of Ontarians. If you are sitting in traffic congestion, you are part of the problem. There are zero bike lanes on our highways yet congestion still exists. Motor vehicles are the problem, not bikes!\nThis is such a regressive 1950s policy.  I bike to work more than I drive. It takes me 30min to drive on most days because of highway traffic and 35-40min to bike. I'm looking forward to pushing my cycling into November or even later if I can. One part of my route is extremely busy during rush hour but thankfully my municipality of Hamilton has a bike lane there. It isn't perfect as it isn't protected, but it allows for the stack of cars to inch along as I ride on past them. Removing this bike lane won't speed up traffic as I would then be riding within traffic. I would also be at greater risk of being killed by a vehicle as they race to pass me. I also ride a lot in Toronto. Could you imagine removing the bike lane on Royal York? Or Lakeshore Rd? Both routes are high motor  vehicle traffic areas with tons of cyclists yet there is reduced conflict with bikes because we have our own dedicated space.  If I am commuting to work or the grocery store, I want the most direct route to my destination. It's about time society gets it out of their head that bicycles are only for leisure trips and that they are a legitimate, convenient, non polluting, less space hogging mode of transportation than a motor vehicle.\nWasn't it you who said that you felt safer riding a bike when there were bike lanes? Why don't you stand by what you said?  Every cyclist injury and death that occurs as a result of this policy, would be preventable.\n"

        "comment": "I, a Toronto resident, support installation of bike lanes which require removal of car traffic lanes. Further, I strongly oppose removal of existing bike lanes.\nData support that cycling infrastructure and initiatives reduce congestion, are beneficial for the environment (eg, fewer vehicle emissions), and improve transportation access. Evidence also shows that the primary contributor to car and general gridlock is the amount of cars on the road - which will increase if bike lanes are not built or are removed.\nBike lanes are necessary for many Torontonians to commute in a safe, healthy, and timely manner, as well as from a financial perspective. Moreover, maintenance and growth of cycling infrastructure is complementary to efficient public transportation.\nIt is extremely disappointing to see the Ontario government focus and interfere to this degree on municipal transportation affairs, particularly given the immediate and widespread issues related to healthcare, education, jobs, housing etc in this province. Implementation of this proposal will certainly not achieve its stated purpose, particularly with regards to the environment, and is directly contrary to available data and expert opinions. I hope that the province will consider this evidence and the wider public in its decision-making, to prioritize the safety and well-being of all residents over the convenience of car drivers.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes and making it more difficult to build bike lanes will harm individuals, increase individuals financial burdens, increase commute times to work, and will not improve traffic.\nBike lanes are used as a primary method of transportation, especially in the city of Toronto. Biking in bike lanes reduces the chance of physical harm and death. As a cyclist, I am safer in the bike lanes. I exclusively cycle on routes that have bike lanes because there is less of a chance of a motor vehicle collision. This sentiment is reflected in Ling et al. (2020)'s study (attached) that showed that the number of cyclist-car collisions were reduced when bike lanes were installed. The Canadian Pediatric Society also released a Position Statement in May 2024 (attached) that promotes safer biking infrastructure, including protected bike lanes, because it reduces biker collisions and reduces cycling injuries. I am also a trauma-neurosurgery intensive care nurse and I have seen first-hand the horrific, life-altering and life-threatening harm that can occur when a cyclist is hit by a car. If we care about peoples' health and safety, we must continue to build safe, protected bike lanes.\nBiking also reduces individuals' financial burdens and decreases commute times. As a nurse working in the downtown core, I regularly commute to work via bike. I can either cycle to work for free for 20mins, use TTC which often costs $3.25 each way but takes 1 hour of waiting & transit, or drive 4km and pay $25 in parking fees. The obvious choice would be biking to work. If bike lanes were to be removed, myself and other individuals who work in the downtown core will not feel safe biking to work. Many individuals who cannot bike safely to work without bike lanes will choose to drive instead. This will just increase traffic and congestion in the downtown core. More cars on the road will also produce a negative environmental impact by increasing greenhouse gas emissions (see the IDTP report attached).\nThe idea of moving bike lanes from their already established places (i.e. on Yonge St, Bloor St, and University Ave) to other side streets is also a financial burden to taxpayers and the government. These bike lanes are frequently used and are already completed. Removing them will cost a significant amount of money and will result in increased traffic due to construction to remove these lanes and build new ones elsewhere. On top of this, bikers would have to take convoluted routes around the city which will take longer and there will be no positive economic boost that occurs when cycling lanes are built along important commercial roads (see the Portland Study attached). In strapped economic times and in a busy city, biking is the healthier, more economical, and most efficient method of transport.\nI, and many others in the city of Toronto, strongly oppose this proposal. Bike lanes protect people physically and financially. They must be promoted and protected in the city of Toronto.\n"

These 2 streets used to move traffic well with multiple lanes and now have only 1 real usable lane at intersections where turning lanes have been included. Meanwhile King just south has basically banned cars and is mainly used by streetcars and bikes. I drive to the Danforth area in the east end to go to a gym several days a week and traffic is now impossible on Dundas or Gerrard eastbound because of the reduction of traffic lanes for bikes so Eastern is the only option without bike lanes.  NO ONE CARES ABOUT PEOPLE WITH MOBILITY CHALLENGES. Bike lanes have severely impacted my partner with Parkinson's disease as it is now very hard for to get an Uber to drop him off close to a business or dr's office on Yonge or on Danforth due to reduction of areas to pull over/bike lanes.  Even if we drive with his wheelchair sticker there is no where to park close to let him off.  Why do the rights of cyclists matter more than a disabled person?\n"

The roads that have been changed to accommodate bike lanes are some of our major roads in Ottawa and are creating gridlock.\nWe have a major intersection at the corner of Donald and St Laurent that is just a mess since the removal of right turning lanes (from Donald to St Laurent).  There is one lane to turn left, another to go straight or turn right, traffic just idles there since no one can turn right on a red light at this intersection.  I don't travel there daily but do frequent the area a few times a month to do local shopping.  I've never seen any bicycles using this expensive infrastructure.\nReturning the right lane to turn onto St Laurent Boulevard would make traffic flow better and we would have less cars idling.\nI'm glad the province is finally stepping in, some of these councilors are just speaking for a handful of loud activists and don't seem to realize they're suppose to represent all of their constituents not just their buddies.\n"

Gridlock is not being worsened by bike lanes and there is no data to suggest that removing bike lanes to restore multiple lanes of traffic will do anything to improve gridlock.\nMunicipalities have far and above more expertise than the provincial government on where bike lanes should be installed to reduce traffic and approve alternative means of transportation. There is no logic to shifting the decision-making to the provincial government to determine where and when bike lanes should be authorized within a municipality.\nThe provincial government should be focusing on supporting municipalities by connecting cities through public transit, instead of removing alternative means of transportation from within cities. Improving alternative modes of transportation is a necessity to manage our growing population. Attempting to efficiently move people between and within our cities through the use of cars is a fools errand. You need only look at the gridlock that exists between and within cities where a staggering amount of new car infrastructure is brand new and yet gridlock prevails.\nThe key to unlocking the ability to transport people more efficiently is by prioritizing the highest density forms of transportation, of which single occupant vehicles ranks lowest. Ontario could choose to be a leader in North America by abandoning its obsession with car traffic and prioritize high-density means of transportation. Focus on contracting experienced public transit designers and developers for regional networks and leave municipalities to manage biking infrastructure on their own.\n"
