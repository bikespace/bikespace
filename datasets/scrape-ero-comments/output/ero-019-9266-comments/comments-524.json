        "comment": "This is another misguided and unwelcome move by the provincial government to override municipal authority.  The province is offering no data to support the concept that bike lane conversion meaningfully impacts transit times.  Bike ridership is relatively low, in part, because it is unsafe.\nThe provincial government should focus effort on economic development and growth, within its jurisdiction, rather than meddling in municipal affairs where it achieves no better results.\n"

        "comment": "I am a downtown Toronto resident who drives daily in the city. This bill infuriates me on so many levels. I am strongly against the passing of this bill and here are my key reasons:\n1. Bike are Traffic: Bike traffic is a reality of traffic in Toronto. We have a high volume of bikes moving through the city and we need to acknowledge this and provide effective ways to manage that traffic - in some cases this may mean reducing a car lane and that is ok. When bikes have their own lane they don\u2019t slow down car traffic - this is a good thing! Having to drive below the speed limit because you can\u2019t safely pass a slow bike sucks and this happens all the time when you don\u2019t have bike lanes. Does building bike lanes cause construction delays - yes. But that is a short term problem for a long term fix for overall congestion.\n2. Bike Lanes Increase Safety: I am thankful for every Toronto road I drive on that has bike lanes - the bikes stay in their lane and I\u2019m not worried about hitting them. How is this a bad thing? It also often means that bikes are more likely to stay off sidewalks keeping pedestrians safer.\n3. Waste of Money: This bill proposes removing lanes that have already been built (in some cases very recently). How does this make sense! Not only is their removal a waste of money but the construction related to removing them will cause more traffic delays. In addition,  managing the new process required to provide ongoing oversight and approval of city bike lanes at the provincial level will require additional, long-term staffing costs.  I do not want my tax dollars going towards this type of initiative.\n4. Jurisdiction: Since when is the construction of bike lanes a provincial issue?  Doesn\u2019t the province have more important things to deal with like health care, education and a housing crisis! My guess is that if Queens Park was not in Toronto this bill would never have been raised. If the politicians that need to drive to Queens Park have an issue with the lanes (which surprise surprise the lanes listed in the bill are all around Queens Park) then raise that issue as a Toronto Citizen at City hall - this is an example political overreach at it\u2019s worse. Cities conduct extensive consultation and research to identify where lanes should go - that process is where any issues around lanes (by both citizens and businesses) should be raised - locally.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose Bill 212. This represents a governmental overreach on the province's part, and is completely contrary to the principles of \"small government\". This is also completely contrary to the provincial government's commitment to red tape reduction. The Ministry of Red Tape Reduction's mandate is to: 1)  Modernize legislation, regulations, and policies that can be burdensome, inefficient, and inflexible; 2) Work across government to reduce red tape; and 3) Measure and report publicly on how we have made it easier for businesses and individuals to work with government.\nBill 212 does not meet any of these mandates. This legislation is an additional burden that specifically targets Toronto, which is an inefficient use of legislation, and is inflexible by refusing to consider local needs. This legislation does not work across government to reduce red tape, in fact, it's a substantial increase in red tape foisted upon the municipal government by the provincial government. This legislation is not based on sound scientific evidence, and any measurements or public reports outlining the outcomes of this legislation will either be incomplete, flawed, or outright inaccurate, considering the evidence-based rationale for Bill 212 simply does not exist.\nThe premier should be ashamed of wasting taxpayers money on a proposal that will ultimately lead to 1) an increase in cyclists' deaths, and 2) an increase in traffic along the Toronto streets where bike lanes are removed. If Bill 212 is passed into legislation, then the premier must compensate every dead cyclist's family, as part of the province's unwavering commitment to making life easier and more affordable for people and families: after all, a death in the family makes life harder, and death is unfortunately an expensive process for families to go through (consider funeral costs, the costs of settling an estate, the loss of future potential income of a breadwinner). As well, if Bill 212 is passed into legislation, then the premier should increase funding for public transit substantively, or else be held accountable for the increase in traffic as former cyclists start commuting by car. Forcing residents to drive cars instead of biking results in 1) higher upfront costs as a car is exponentially more expensive to buy than a bike, 2) higher pollution levels that will cause more pressure in our medical system in the longterm, 3) increase in congestion which reduces the amount of time residents can be productive, due to being stuck in traffic (as opposed to actively generating economic output such as by working, shopping, dining, etc.).\nBike lanes should be a municipal decision, and Bill 212 represents gross interference by the provincial government. The provincial government is acting as a nanny state, is contravening the democratic will of the people as represented by our elected municipal officials, and is misusing taxpayer funds to serve the premier's personal needs (as the Toronto bike lanes specifically singled out are blatantly on the roads the premier uses for his own commuting purposes.\nThe provincial government should not spend taxpayer money on undoing municipal infrastructure projects and should instead focus on fixing the Gardiner, finishing the Eglinton LRT, and developing non-car-related methods for alleviating traffic in the city.\n"

        "comment": "I am puzzled and disappointed about this piece of legislation. The government has not provided any concrete data and evidence that removing bike lanes will solve traffic congestion in cities like Toronto. There are other reasons that traffic is congested including construction blocking lanes, car drivers including delivery trucks and ride share vehicles blocking intersections and lanes. Removing bike lanes does nothing to meet this government's goal of getting highways built or keeping people safe. Instead removing bike lanes will have a trickle effect of more people now taking cars and clogging roads. Municipal infrastructure issues are a Municipal problem  not the province's! This legislation is a complete over reach of provincial power. Cities have a consultation process that seeks their constituents' opinion on things like creating or removing bike lanes.\nI personally use bike lanes to commute to work and my safety will be compromised when they are removed. I choose to commute by bike to reduce congestion on the roads, improve my health thereby saving your government money on spending health care dollars on me in the future.\nI know this legislation will pass regardless as your government has a majority but I urge you to reconsider other options to reduce gridlock and not to remove bike lanes in the city of Toronto or prevent future ones from being built.\n"

(They don't seem to care what Toronto thinks of them, since we're clearly not the voter base they cater to.) This is being pushed through despite evidence-based studies and major investment by the city of Toronto over the past several years. And it sets a bad precedent for provincial involvement in Toronto politics and legislation.\nOf course gridlock is real, especially at rush hour - as a cyclist and a car owner, I've experienced it. But gridlock will not be solved by taking out existing bike lanes on these major arteries, especially with the fast-growing number of residents in the towers taking over every downtown neighbhourhood, delivery vehicles, UPS trucks double-parked, etc. Investing massively in public transportation  - built quickly, not over decades - is a better long-term solution.\nA question for car-owners who commute into the city to work: Why should the drivers of single occupant vehicles - massive, carbon-spewing cars and trucks that can kill cyclists, scooter users and pedestrians - trump the rights of individual people who ride bikes?\nPlease reconsider this heinous, ill-thought-out, reactionary plan that will make streets less safe, make pollution and climate change worse, and not create substantial benefit for drivers.\n"

        "comment": "The removal of bike lanes will only add safety risks and likely increase congestion with both the initial construction phase, as well as having bikes and cars share the lane (default if there is no bike lane).\nAlso, by removing the bike lanes, they would only get an extra car lane one way, so in the direction without a lane you will have one share lane with bikes, and in many situations the lane is quite narrow, so that car lane would be extra congested as cyclists would be forced to take a lane.\nIf anyone had real experience as a driver or cyclist in the area, they would see this makes zero sense.\nFinally, bloor, Yonge, and university all have a functioning subway line, so driving on them shouldn\u2019t be most people\u2019s primary method of transportation, so those streets especially should not have bike lanes removed by people that don\u2019t actually live there.\nI also think we need some good evidence to prove any of their points.  Especially that there is not an increase in the risk to cyclists with this change. The environment side effects should also be reviewed, as this would contribute to climate change. And it would make the most sense that the people that live here should get a real say (not the fake ones that you give us while allowing condos to be built constantly everywhere).\nI am a physician who lives just off of bloor that drives, bikes, and takes the subway. I also have the experience of constant construction for the past few years and don\u2019t want several years more on the same issue - that would make congestion for everyone.\n"

        "comment": "The recent tabling of Bill 212, the Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act by Transportation Minister Prabmeet Sarkaria is a troubling escalation in the Ontario government\u2019s push for Highway 413.\nThis bill represents an alarming departure from transparency and environmental responsibility. It permits round-the-clock construction, fast-tracks land expropriation, and imposes harsh penalties on those who oppose the project. Even more concerning, it eliminates the need for further environmental assessments \u2014 except for Indigenous consultations \u2014 and keeps critical studies on natural and cultural heritage hidden from the public eye.\nBuilding this toll-free mega-highway will destroy irreplaceable farmland, fragment our ecosystems, and carve through the Greenbelt, threatening the very fabric of our communities. Meanwhile, there are far more sustainable solutions to address Ontario\u2019s growth, such as improving public transit, subsidizing truck tolls on Highway 407, and investing in green infrastructure.\nReverse Bike Lane Restrictions/Removals. The government of Ontario should demonstrate leadership that provides its residents with more \u2013 not fewer \u2013 opportunities for achieving a sustainable, safe, and prosperous future.  According to research, a standard vehicle releases around five metric tons of carbon dioxide a year. Choosing a bike instead of a car just once a day cuts an average person\u2019s transportation-related carbon emissions by 67%. Ontario contains the most densely populated areas in the country and is home to 40% of Canada\u2019s population.\nThe provincial government should not spend taxpayer money on undoing municipal infrastructure projects and should instead focus on fixing the Gardiner, finishing the Eglinton LRT, and developing non-car-related methods for alleviating traffic in the city.\nAccording to the Government of Canada, only 37.6% of children aged 5-17 are getting the minimum 60 minutes per week of moderate to vigorous activity recommended by Health Canada. Across Ontario, fewer kids are using active modes of transportation (e.g., walking, cycling, rollerblading, scootering and rolling for wheelchairs or other mobility devices) for their school journey: 22% of kids walk to school and 4% cycle, whereas 74% travel by motorized transport. Bicycle lanes are important for kids who currently ride their bicycles, but also for reversing these trends.\nDriving kids to school has led to several serious impacts: More inactivity. Kids miss the opportunity for much-needed physical activity, fresh air, and quality interaction with parents, caregivers, and friends.  Less focus. Students are less focused in class, contributing to poorer academic outcomes.  Worse congestion. An estimated 25-40% of vehicle congestion during morning rush hour is related to school drop-off.  Riskier roads. 78% of Ontario parents reported witnessing unsafe driving behaviours in school zones.\nBuilding for the Future\nThe legislation will jeopardize most future developments of safe, protected bike lanes in Ontario, reducing transportation options for children and families and contributing to higher rates of collisions, physical inactivity, and pollution.\nI strongly encourage the government to reverse course on this legislation and instead encourage municipalities to continue building networks of high-quality protected bike lanes on major streets. Our collective future depends on it.  It goes further. Most suburban residents of the GTA have reason to oppose the construction of 413, even if they do not care about environmental sustainability. This is because it will make traffic worse in the GTA. Every local community along the proposed route of highway 413 opposes it.\n"

The People of Toronto like to have safe streets and options for moving about. The only people opposed to the bike lanes are the people who are insisting on commuting into the city by car. Why is this even a thing. I am sorry this is 2024 not 1974. This is a short sighted initiative that will only cause issues into the future. The Future is not seeing multi lane roadways through major cities. More and more young people are buying Condos that do not even have parking spaces. The Safety and enjoyment of the residents who live in Toronto should come before the \"driving\" needs of those commuting into the city.  Its time to place tolls on the roads and have people who insist on driving pay the full cost of maintaining those roads and dealing with the pollution they cause. We can use that money to create a better subway system. Cars are not the transportation choice of the future and Droug Ford needs to understand this. Yes you build it they will come.......but that also works for other means of transportation, not just roads and highways.\n"
