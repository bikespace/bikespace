        "comment": "To whom it ought to concern,\nThere should be no reduction in bike lanes within the city of Toronto, nor anywhere else in Ontario. Bike lanes serve to reduce congestion, not make it worse. They keep cyclists safer, making cycling a viable commuting option. More cyclists on the roads means fewer cars. Even those driving cars should be in favour of bike lanes. There have been frequent occasions where, when living in Kingston and Ottawa, I felt I had to choose my safety because being on a bicycle was so dangerous without dedicated cycling lanes. Please do not do this. It is harmful and inconvenient for everyone involved.\nRegards,\nLV\n"

        "comment": "Restating another comment:\nThe stated, abstract objective of this Act is to reduce \u201cgridlock,\u201d using means which are proven to be detrimental to public health and safety, mobility and access to Ontario communities for all people, environmental protection, and will aid in worsening the ongoing climate emergency.\nDespite having the authority to do so per the Municipal Act, requiring provincial approval for construction of new bike lanes where they \u201creplace a lane of traffic\u201d is a dramatic overreach of government authority in the affairs of municipalities. This is meddlesome and suggests the provincial government doesn\u2019t have faith or trust in municipalities to manage their own affairs, and further suggests that the provincial government isn\u2019t interested in local democracy\u2014bike lanes aren\u2019t constructed without warning; they are built only after an extensive planning process, which includes considerable research and community input.\nFurthermore, it is an objective fact that more car lanes will not reduce traffic congestion: the concept of Induced Demand indicates that with more car lanes, there is more traffic. This phenomenon has been observed all over the world. If this government were serious about \u201creducing gridlock,\u201d it would be making investments to the tune of several billion dollars to prioritize development and construction of extensive transit projects all over the province, and would invest considerable time, money and effort into the construction of more, comprehensive cycling networks. One more bike on the road is one less car; bikes take up far less space on the road than a single occupancy vehicle, thereby making more room for those who are or who must drive.\nIt is important to mention as well that the three bike lanes Premier Ford has pledged to remove in Toronto also see thousands of users per day\u2014that\u2019s literally thousands of cars that are off the road as a result. Local businesses are more successful in areas with bike lanes (this is easily proven looking at the Bloor Bike Lane reports prepared by City staff in Toronto), and various Toronto BIAs have already come out in support of bike lanes and the detrimental impact their removal would have on local businesses.\nCycling is also the far healthier option: physical activity leads to better health outcomes which leads to less money required for healthcare services.\nInstallation of bike lanes also have the added advantage of making the entire streetscape safer to use for all mobility modes; cars, bikes, pedestrians, and all others. Their existence can save the lives of cyclists and many others. Six cyclists have died on Toronto streets this year, and that is six too many; innocent lives lost because the victims were trying to get across town. Utterly senseless, with families shattered as a result.\nPertaining to bike lanes, my final comment is that the existence of these lanes gives all people greater access to their municipality. Those without the financial means to own a car, pay for insurance, parking, gas, etc. are more able to traverse their municipality for work, recreation, and to support the local economy. A car-centric community is a community that closes itself off to a considerable portion of its population.\nOn the topic of exempting 413 lands from environmental assessments, this is yet another short-sighted policy that will result in disastrous outcomes for the environment. The area where the highway is intended to be built is environmentally sensitive land. Once paved over, that land is lost as a carbon sink, a natural habitat for native flora and fauna, and as a floodplain/natural flood control measure\u2014forever. The proposal that this highway should be exempted from any environmental assessment to expedite development suggests the government doesn\u2019t care whatsoever about the environment and, again, is not serious about eliminating gridlock: as mentioned above, the concept of induced demand means that on completion, it will create more gridlock and spew more harmful greenhouses gas emissions into the atmosphere. Here, again, I must emphasize that if the government is serious about reducing gridlock, the only way forward is to invest in and build a massive public transit infrastructure, and augment municipal streets with alternative means of mobility, such as bike lanes.\nI question whether any planners, environmentalists, engineers or any other credentialed experts were consulted at all in the creation of this bill.\nIn summary, Bill 212 is a backwards approach to \u201creducing\u201d gridlock which will have the complete opposite effect of its stated objective: gridlock will become worse, public safety will be worse, local economies will suffer, the environment will be senselessly, irreparably destroyed, and health outcomes for Ontarians will be worse, which will end up costing us more. This bill should not move forward.\n"

        "comment": "I disagree with removing bike lanes. As someone who commutes to work via walking, bus, and bike, I believe removing these lanes will decrease the efficiency, enjoyability and accessibility to commuting via bike.\nSince the increases of bike lanes, I have felt safer riding my bike in areas without bike paths. Riding my bike on the road in between cars can be dangerousand scary, and having less bike lanes will deter those who would like to ride their bikes around the city more as many people I know feel unsafe due to aggressive drivers and not having enough space on the road to bike.\nI believe in these times of enviromental concern, we should be promoting the creation of side walks, bike lanes, bus use etc. We should be focusing on making commuting as accessible, safe and reliable as possible. Providing these enviroments will make it more enjoyable and easier to chose other options in terms of commuting. Neglecting these enviroments creates more car use out of frustration, thus creating further traffic/gridlocks.\nOttawa is a beautiful city with many commuting options. Please consider the implications of favouring cars over other more sustainable and universal choices we can make.\nThank you.\n"

        "comment": "This is an egregious jurisdictional overreach. Decisions regarding bike lanes and municipal traffic management should rest within our elected municipal councillors.\nIt is a complete waste of money to rip out existing bike lanes in Toronto, which are incredibly well used. Those cyclists will either 1) start riding in the car lane, further slowing traffic and putting themselves in danger, or 2) just drive themselves, making congestion worse.\nThe only way to reduce car traffic congestion is to provide safe, reliable alternatives to driving. This has been proven time and time again all over the world, however much our government chooses not to believe it. Building yet another highway, expanding highway lanes or, bafflingly, building a tunnel under the 401 will only induce more cars to fill the existing space.\nThis government has repeatedly demonstrated disdain for anyone outside of a car, and normalizes aggression against those opting for more sustainable modes of transportation. Lives have been lost and will continue to be lost if we do not take pedestrian and cyclist safety seriously.\nI urge the government to reconsider this stance, and focus their energy on completing the crosstown LRT.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are an important part of our cities and have a negligible impact on congestion. Environmental assessments are a necessary part of construction, both to ensure that the nature that Ontarians enjoy is not destroyed, and to ensure that existing water systems will not be affected in a way that increases risks of flooding or similar situations that can be a direct result of paving over areas such as wetlands.\nRipping out existing bike lanes is a waste of taxpayer money perhaps only on par with the COVID-19 alert bracelets that failed to make their way to the public. Gridlock can only be solved by decreasing the number of cars in dense urban areas (people should not be driving through a city's downtown unless their destination is in that area), providing alternate means of transportation such as public transit and active transit, and creating safer spaces for pedestrians. This will have the additional affect of increasing traffic to smaller businesses in the area.\nThe Premier's actions suggest that he seems to think of himself as a city mayor, rather that the person responsible for managing an entire province. I would sincerely rather see action directed towards our abysmal rates of new housing construction, underfunded health care, or our floundering education system.\n"

        "comment": "The answer to solving gridlock is NOT making it easier for cars to drive. I say this as someone who owns a car, and has lived both in the suburbs of GTA and downtown Toronto.\nWe need to improve public transportation (running GO trains to suburbs more often, more buses in those areas so people can reach the GO Train station easier, improve TTC as a whole) and improve infrastructure for other modes of transportation like bikes.\nI would prefer to ride a bike in Toronto but it is not safe right now compared to a lot of countries in Western Europe. These are the real issues that need to be solved, making it easier for cars to drive is not a real solution. We need to catch up with our European counterparts on these issues, not push disgusting overreacting legislation like this.\n"

        "comment": "According to the Toronto Region Board of Trade's \"Congestion What's at Stake in Toronto's 2023 Mayoral By-election\" report that was published in 2023, traffic congestion in Toronto \"costs the region $11 billion annually in lost productivity and opportunity.\" Although this $11 billion would not go solely to the government, at an 11% corporate tax rate, this could result in up to $1.21 billion in tax revenue. Although these figures are just focusing on the Toronto area, many other smaller cities and municipalities across the province would also see increased productivity should gridlock and traffic congestion be decreased.\nInvestments in public transport and alternative methods of transport across the province could greatly increase the productivity of the province, and even spur a strengthened economy due to increased mobility, and reduced travel times.\nA 2017 report from the US department of transportation Federal Highway Administration titled \"The Dutch Approach to Bicycle Mobility: Retrofitting Street Design for Cycling,\" states that the Netherland's high bicycle use results in an average lifespan increase of six months, while decreasing healthcare costs in the country by 19 \u20ac million. The report goes on to say \"In addition, by providing an inexpensive alternative to both public transport and the car, the bicycle promotes social inclusion and access to jobs, services, and leisure in an efficient way. Investments on cycling do not come at the expenses of other road users. Evidence shows that policies to encourage bicycle users also benefit car drivers and the public transport network in terms of lower travel times, better accessibility and increased safety.\"\nDespite the larger size of Ontario than the Netherlands, and the need for vehicular traffic to travel many of the vast distances between Ontario's cities and towns, the average commuting distance in Ontario is 12.5km as reported by Lena Ahmadi et al in the journal MDPI in 2012. This distance is shorter than the average commute in the Netherlands which was pegged at 18.5km as reported by Mike Schroten's MSc thesis at the Delft University of Technology in 2022. Despite the increased commute distance in the Netherlands, a larger fraction of the Dutch people commute to work by bicycle than those with similar commute distances in Ontario.\nIt is time that we stop incentivizing and requiring that individuals drive a car for every small task, and time that we look to other countries, and cities to see what we can do better. The lack of walkable and bike infrastructure connecting homes to schools, grocery stores and shopping centres in this province is quite frankly a joke to the rest of the world (outside of Canada and the United States), and it is high time that we look into our cities and urban development practices to produce towns and cities that are better connected, and provide residents multiple means of travel outside of owning a car.\nIn the words of Gustavo Petro, the president of Colombia,  \"A developed country is not a place where the poor have cars. It's where the rich use public transportation.\" The same should be said for bikes, and those who use them to commute to work and perform daily tasks such as shopping or recreation.\n"
