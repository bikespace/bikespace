        "comment": "I can't believe the government is tabling such regressive legislation in 2024. Completly disregarding research, and for what? Brownie points from drivers who might vote for you because there us no research to back up your claims apart from the feelings of a few people?\nTruly an embarrassment and makes of mockery of the \"Progressive\" in the the PC name. Our cities need varied forms of transportation but doubling down on cars by ripping out bike lanes is so painfully backwards it makes me laugh cry. Stop distracting and actually use your resources and experience to tackle problems. The solution of cars first is so pass\u00e9. Remove this legislation from the table so we don't have to look back and ask ourselves why we took 10 steps backwards.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes on main streets is possibly the worst thing we can do in specifically Toronto today.\n1- It discourages people from biking to commute or run errands which causes an increase in green house gas emissions.\n2- It makes streets unsafe for everybody. Look at the configuration of the Danforth in Toronto before the bike lane installation. 2 lanes. 1 permanently taken up by parked cars. Cyclists having to weave in and out of traffic all the while being worried about getting the driver side door opened on them as well as worrying about impatient drivers passing too closely cause they are also weaving in and out of the right lane as soon as there is a break from parked cards and speeding to beat cars on the left lane. And look at it now - calm but steady moving traffic, still ample parking on the street. bike lanes on the outside that provide safety for all.\n3- Money that is being considered for spending to rip out existing bike lanes should be invested into public transit. Either GO train or municipal transit agencies.\nAll in all - the more drivers we can get off the road the better the traffic will be. This one more lane mentality has never worked and will never work. Think twice (or more) before you impede progress and even undo decades of progress in this regard.\nServe the people you are meant to and do not become a power hungry tyrant, Doug Ford.\n"

        "comment": "Hi, this comment is about the bike lanes in Toronto. As we all know the Ontario government has decided to eliminate some bike lanes. This is an overreach and they are ignoring the municipal government and the residents.  Eliminating bike lanes won't solve traffic problems. As a driver I think it makes sense for cyclists to have their own lane. It is safer for everyone. The City of Toronto has already spent millions of dollars to create a safe infrastructure for everyone. Instead of spending tax payers money on removing them, the Ontario government could spend it on improving public transportation. Please help the Ontarian population to move forward and not backwards. Canada is one of the last few countries in the Western world that has decided to implement bike lanes. Eliminating them will just take us back. I personally do own an older car but my family can commute anywhere in Toronto by public transportation. Adding more car lanes will cause more deaths and is bad for the environment.\nThank you for your time\nFred from Toronto\n"

Regularly she uses the bicycle lanes that have been recently installed along Bloor St.\nMy children went to daycare at University and College, again, we used the bike lanes daily to bring them to and from.\nMore recently, my daughter was diagnosed with and has beaten leukemia. She was transported to SickKids to be diagnosed on the back of a bicycle, because it was faster than by car. She went to treatments on the back of a bicycle because she wasn't allowed to go into the public subway system. And now she visits for checkups on the bicycle as well, because it's more fun than driving.\nPlease keep the bike lane decisions up to the city and the people that use them.\n"

        "comment": "* I DO NOT SUPPORT THIS BILL *\n* A step backwards for everybody involved *\nTime and time again we see in other places that removing pedestrian and cycling infrastructure and pushing people to using cars. Using cars is detrimental to not just the city/municipality, but also to the people because they don't get the chance to be active, and the density of cars vs any other mode\nIncentivizing alternative modes of transportation that are more space efficient like public transit and cycling and other active transportation modes.\nWhen you expand a road, travelling by car becomes quicker and easier in the short term. Which makes travelling by car more attractive and so more people are more likely to use their cars than usual.\nMore car trips = more cars on the road and all that extra space quickly disappears.\nThe more infrastructure you add of something like bike lanes will make more people bike, especially if you start to expand the network to more main places, Like home, work, school, etc.\nSame thing goes with adding more roads or replacing bike lanes with roads people who would have biked to their place will have to take their car.\nIf you're going to make driving the easiest way to get around a city most people are going to drive, if you're going to make a city where the easiest way around it by biking and walking most people will bike and walk.\nBiking is the healthiest greenest best option something the Environmental Registry of Ontario should be promoting not actively taking away!!!\n"

        "comment": "I am against Bill 212 for several reasons. First and foremost, the provincial government is over-reaching into municipal affairs. The city used local taxpayer funds to implement changes to how the roads are shared for different modes of transportation. The city officials were elected by the people who use and pay for the roads. The province should not have the authority to over-rule decisions made at the city level. And it DEFINITELY should not be able to remove infrastructure that has already been installed, at great cost and with great disruption.\nI personally use a car, a bike and the TTC to commute, in addition to walking. I think divided/protected bike lanes are an important part of reducing gridlock on the city streets. A larger volume of people can move along a street faster if there is a safe bike lane available. Lots of studies show that on busy streets during rush hour there are more people commuting on bicycles than on cars. We should not be prioritizing the preferences of drivers over a system that provides a common benefit to all.\nI also do not think the province has properly considered what will happen when e-bike delivery drivers, who proliferated in the last 4 years and have been using the dedicated bike lanes, start to share lanes with regular vehicle traffic. There will be a significant period of adjustment, likely with a lot of accidents.\n"

        "comment": "It has been repeatedly proven that adding more car lanes does not actually reduce traffic. Meanwhile, providing more opportunities for people to travel using bikes and/or public transit does reduce traffic. Studies from around the world show that bike lanes ease traffic, reduce emissions and benefit local businesses. In cases such as this, it is important to listen to the experts and researchers that have been doing this work for years and are knowledgeable about the potential solutions.\nI urge the Government of Ontario to propose new legislation to (1) make it EASIER for municipalities to build bike lanes and (2) make public transit more affordable and reliable across the province. Again, studies show that these things DO actually reduce traffic congestion and contribute to a healthier population and climate.\n"

        "comment": "As a resident and home owner on Bloor Street West I make use of the bike lane 3 to 4 times a day. I observe the bike lane in regular use by many others, including many parents bringing their children to school and daycare by bike. This continues year-round. For many of us the bicycle lanes are very important infrastructure for residents to reduce carbon emissions and prevent urban sprawl.\nAt our location in the City's Junction area, the train lines prevent the use of 'safe' secondary routes. Removal, of the bike lanes will put individuals, including children, at risk. Cyclists will continue to use the roadways as there are no near alternative routes for 'active' transportation.\nThis Act is not supported by research with or in consultation with city of Toronto residents. The removal of bike lanes on three streets is not a sufficient response to the challenge that too high volumes of car and truck traffic in Toronto poses to the Province of Ontario. I recommend this Act be amended to include more solutions that work to reduce traffic volumes originating outside of the City of Toronto. In its current form, the plans described to remove bicycle lanes in Bill 212 may be a public nuisance.\n"

        "comment": "The real causes of traffic congestion are tow things: Construction and single occupancy vehicles. Having entire lanes blocked for years on end does far more to snarl a city than a bloody bike lane.\nCars with only a driver likewise cause congestion because of the sheer volume of space they take up compared to carpools or transit.\nAlso, why are the lives of cyclists worth less? Because taking out those lanes will lead to people getting killed, you should have no illusions on that.\n"

Adding to the gridlock instead of easing it.\nIf the purpose is to actually get cars moving, the only real solution is removing the amount of cars on the road, there are way better options like removing on street parking and doing stuff the province is meant to do like focusing on expanding transit and finishing the eglinton crosstown instead of meddling on municipal matters.\n"

        "comment": "I have found the design of the bike lanes to be quite dangerous for cyclists. On Bloor, which is the route I am sometimes driving, you cannot see if a cyclist or - worse - an ebike barreling along at 30 km/hrs is approaching while you are trying to turn right onto a side street. Why? Because cars are parked inbetween the car lane and the bike lane. Add dusk and no lights on bikes, and you have an accident waiting to happen. I wholeheartedly support bike lanes in our city, but design them properly. Perhaps a compromise would be to install the new bike lanes on secondary routes, such as Annette and Dupont, as an east-west route. I think there is away to keep both cyclists and drivers happy. An grossly overlooked solution would be to pour much-needed funds into improving our subway system! The TTC is no longer a reliable, timely way to move through the city.\n"

Seems like you haven't thought very far ahead... Or maybe at all?\nYour team does have the ability to use computers and reference available information that exists on city planning, transportation, and infrastructure, right? Maybe start with that. Or you could ask municipalities how they do it, since you clearly don't have a clue!\nPlease explain to me why I fund a government that can't coordinate and gather basic information. It's really just so embarrassing to live here governed by you all these days and seems to be getting expodentially worse... Maybe you should ask for help???\n"
