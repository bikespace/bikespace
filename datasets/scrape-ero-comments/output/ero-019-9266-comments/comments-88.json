        "comment": "I voted for Ford in the last election as I believed he was a candidate of common sense. There is no common sense to rip out bikes lanes in Toronto - data will show that it will only increase congestion. If Ford feels the need to cater to suburban drivers in Etobicoke - rip out of the bike lanes west of Jane and be done with it.\n"

        "comment": "Thanks for doing this (Bill 212- Ruducing Gridlock) as the increased number of bike lanes in Toronto has made driving a nightmare in downtown where I live.\nI would love to see the following implemented:\n1. When a car is turning right at an intersection with a bike lane, the car needs to be able to move over to the far right, against the curb & any oncoming bikes should go around the car, on its left hand side. This will ensure the driver only has to worry about pedestrians. Today, most turns require the car turning right to look at for pedestrians, as well as fast moving bikes. It's often difficult to turn right, with both pedestrians & bikes moving at different speeds.\n2. Study the traffic flow/usage of existing bike lanes.  If car traffic is backed up & few bikes use the lane, the lane should be removed.\n3. Keep bike lanes on less busy streets & only have cars on the busy streets.\n4. All bike lanes should have neighbourhood  public consultation on their implementation, so residents directly impacted by the bike lane are made aware of the change in their neighbourhood. Often, lanes materialize without neighbourhood awareness.\n5. It would be really nice if the city planners creating new bikes, must live in the impacted community, so they can live with their decisions, on a daily basis. A friend lives south of Bloor St E & when she occasionally has to take her car out, she turns onto Bloor St & then comes to a complete stop. Before the bike lane, traffic moved on the street.\n6. A new bike lane should only be put in if it doesn't greatly impact another population, like car drivers. If it's going to greatly negatively impact a segment of the population, it shouldn't be implemented or a work around should be in place for the impacted segment.\n7. All future City of Toronto surveys on bike lanes should consist of only non-biased language/questions. In a recent survey, conducted at tax payer's expense, all questions & language was on how to increase the number of bikes lanes. There were no questions regarding any negative impacts of them. The city needs to seek the input of all its citizens, not just a selected, limited segment, when making changes.\nThanks for listening & thanks for taking action on this issue, as it seems the City of Toronto was ignoring some of its citizens, while favouring others.\n"

        "comment": "This is an absolutely backwards step in terms of transportation policy. Bike lanes are an essential form of transportation infrastructure which actually helps to decrease vehicular traffic. Removing bike lanes will have the opposite effect of the government\u2019s stated desire to reduce congestion.\nFurthermore, it will waste tax dollars that were just recently spent on these projects. I urge you to withdraw this bill and leave transportation planning to transportation experts.\n"

        "comment": "This is an appalling and utterly senseless motion.  There's no credible evidence to indicate that bike lanes add to downtown congestion, and removing them only makes it less safe for cyclists.  Cyclists will not cease sharing the roads with drivers if the lanes are removed, and the provincial driver's handbook regulates that drivers treat cyclists as vehicles and give them the space of an entire lane.  How on earth is that going to to decrease gridlock?  It certainly won't make it safer for anyone on a bike.\nRemoving bike lanes also makes it less safe for pedestrians.  E-bikes and motor scooters are already a serious hazard on Toronto sidewalks --if cyclists feel unsafe on the roads, they're going to start using pedestrians spaces too, whether it's legal or not.\nI'm not clear on who the Ford administration is trying to pander to with this boneheaded proposal, but as a non-cycling Torontonian, I'd strongly recommend that it's thrown directly into the wastebin.\n"

Safe cycling infrastructure is the key to solving the gridlock problem and helping to alleviate pollution caused by car traffic. Please focus your time, energy, and funds on what really matters: improving life for the citizens throughout the entire province of Ontario.\n"

        "comment": "Please remove bike lanes on major streets. I have been living downtown for 44 years, and biking the last 20 years. People will bike regardless of bike lanes, I actually find raised bike lanes more dangerous with the risk of hitting them on the bike cars are easy to navigate around. If people are afraid of biking, they can more safely bike on the side streets. I'm so happy the Ford government is finally taking the right stand on just one of Mayor Chow's many poor decisions. Also please open the gardiner Eastbourne ramp at Jarvis. There is no active construction and it backs up the entire downtown core from lakeshore all the way to dundas. Please also open up the Esplanade. It's pure stupidity to block an entire street for a bus that comes for 10 seconds once every half hour.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are a vital component of Toronto's transportation infrastructure, offering numerous benefits that enhance the city's sustainability, livability, and economic vitality. Removing these lanes would be a step backward, while expanding them is crucial for progress.\nEnvironmentally, bike lanes promote eco-friendly transportation, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality. Safety and health benefits include increased protection for cyclists, reduced collisions, and encouragement of physical activity. Economically, bike lanes boost local businesses, increase property values, and reduce infrastructure costs.\nSocially, bike lanes foster community interaction, accessibility, and vibrant public spaces. They also efficiently alleviate traffic congestion, rivaling car travel times and integrating with public transit.\nIn Toronto, bike lanes alleviate congested roads, enhance scenic waterfront routes, and support climate resilience. Expansion plans should focus on enhancing existing lanes, connecting the network city-wide, and incorporating innovative designs.\nRemoving bike lanes is not an effective solution to alleviate gridlock, as research consistently shows. In fact, studies demonstrate that bike lanes have a minimal impact on traffic capacity, often replacing underutilized or parking lanes.\nThe concept of induced demand also comes into play, where adding more car lanes encourages driving, offsetting potential congestion relief. Furthermore, traffic evaporation occurs when reduced capacity leads to behavioral changes, such as carpooling or alternative routes.\nBike lanes are integral to a larger transportation network, promoting multimodal travel and prioritizing safety and efficiency for vulnerable users. Urban planning strategies emphasize sustainability, livability, and economic growth, aligning with bike lane infrastructure.\nToronto has already seen positive results from its bike lanes, including increased cycling mode share, reduced cyclist injuries, and economic growth. Continuing to improve and expand these lanes is essential for creating a people-friendly city.\nPlease consider these points. The government should strive to make the lives of all its citizens better, not just drivers.\n"

This rhetoric is a slap in the face to taxpayers and a waste of resources. It is backwards thinking, believing that Toronto aspires to some sort of 1950s car saturated suburbia.\nI support the further expansion of bike infrastructure.\nOur province has a per capital GDP on par with Alabama, and has continued to decline under the leadership of the conservative party. Over a million  Ontarians do not have access to a family doctor. Education is under funded and suffering. There is a housing crisis. The Ontario Science Center was shuttered. Home care patients are without supplies for treatment and care. However for some reason, none of this is as important to the provincial government as how the city of Toronto manages municipal infrastructure.\nDo better for the citizens of your Ontario. ALL of them, not just the ones who drive cars.\n"
