        "comment": "This is completely opposite of what we need to do. We need better bike lanes infrastructure and fund and encourage bike to work schemes, clean bike lanes on priority in winter to enourage winter cycling to work (like in many colder cities in Norway) (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uhx-26GfCBU).\nThis will reduce traffic and enable drivers as well to go faster. I can not believe the government is doing this, are they completely incompetent or just corrupt under the influence or construction and motor companies?\nLastly, to save our environment, the best thing we can do, much better than electic vehicles is to encourage cycling. The government is doing the exact opposite. Shame!\nBuilding bike lane infrastructure is a magnitude cheaper than expanding and maintaining roads for cars. We need to reduce cars and increase bikes.\n"

        "comment": "This is a ridiculous Bill for many reasons. Firstly, saving who time? Only people who drive cars I suppose? Are the rest of the population that don't drive cars a second class of citizen whose time and safety don\u2019t matter? Second, it\u2019s well known at this point that the cause of gridlock is the number of cars on the road. The first step to resolving gridlock would be to provide safe, effective, alternative transportation options to those who take cars now and thus remove cars from the road. Adding barriers to the addition of an alternative mode of transport will only make the problem worse. Third, the Ontario government is not responsible for the transportation plans of its cities and should continue to let cities decide what is best for them. This is another example of Provincial overreach pushing forward the personal preferences of an uneducated government.\n"

        "comment": "This is indeed a sad time to see such regressive proposed legislation. It has taken many years to install the cycling infratstructure that we have and much more needs to be done. I am speaking from both a cyclist and a driver perspective.\nAs a cyclist I like that I have my own lane, to share with other cyclists, to get to where I need to go and not have to use my car. This includes, riding on busier roads as my destination point is often on those roads.\nAs a driver, I much prefer driving on roads where there is a bike lane. Otherwise cyclists will ride in a lane that is not wide enough to allow a car to pass without it going into the other lane.  I slow to ride behind the cyclist till it is safe to pass.\nUnfortunately many drivers are impatient and will not wait till it is safe to pass, thus increasing the risk of hitting the cyclist, or making an unsafe lane change, or increasing risk for oncoming traffic.\nThe presence of bike infrastructure is good for all. Better we reach our destination in one piece, even if it takes a few minutes longer.\nI urge you to withdraw this regressive, environmentally unfriendly legislation and consider what more can be done to encourage people to leave their cars at home.\n"

As traffic in the city has gotten worse and worse with population growth I bought an electric bike to take my kids to and from school and then get to work. The Yonge bike lanes have enabled me to do this safely. If bike lanes are removed a critical transportation option for the city gets removed.

        "comment": "This bill would make my commute longer and endanger me, my wife, and my three children.\nWe need more bike lanes, not fewer. Every day I see intersections with five or ten bikes lined up in half the space it takes to fit two cars. This is about geometry, and we're not going to eliminate traffic by pushing more people into cars. Transit and bike lanes make it easier to fit the millions of people who want to go into downtown Toronto every day into that small space.\nBike lanes are essential infrastructure, and demagogic attacks on them don't belong in government bills. The rhetoric around them coming from Ontario politicians has already driven a small subset of drivers into aggressive anti-bike behaviour on the road. It has made my life more dangerous. Passing this bill will up the temperature before an election that will import some of the polarization that has developed south of the border. This is irresponsible behaviour.\nPassing this bill will kill Ontarians, and when that happens, the current Government will be responsible.\n"

        "comment": "To Whom It May Concern,\nI am writing to express my concern about the current state of cycling infrastructure in Ottawa and to offer suggestions for improvement. As a cyclist who relies on my bike for transportation, I have observed several challenges that hinder both convenience and safety.\nOne major issue is the lack of connectivity between existing bike lanes.  This often forces cyclists to navigate busy roads with no dedicated cycling space, creating a dangerous situation for everyone.  In my own experience, I frequently encounter gaps in the bike lane network, making it difficult to access businesses and services. This lack of connectivity discourages cycling as a viable transportation option.\nFurthermore, the existing bike lanes are often congested, particularly during peak commuting hours. This congestion highlights the growing popularity of cycling but also underscores the need for expanded and improved infrastructure.\nTo address these issues, I urge the provincial government to:\n * Prioritize the connection of existing bike lane segments: Creating a comprehensive network will make cycling a more attractive option for commuting and running errands.\n * Conduct a study on bike lane usage:  Collecting data on bike lane volumes will provide valuable insights into usage patterns, identify areas of congestion, and inform future infrastructure development.\n * Consider expanding the existing bike lane network: This could include adding new lanes or widening existing ones to accommodate the growing number of cyclists.\nInvesting in cycling infrastructure offers numerous benefits, including:\n * Reduced traffic congestion: Encouraging cycling can help alleviate traffic on roads.\n * Improved air quality:  Increased cycling reduces vehicle emissions, contributing to cleaner air.\n * Enhanced public health: Cycling promotes physical activity and contributes to a healthier population.\nI believe that by addressing the issues I've raised, the provincial government can make significant strides in promoting cycling as a safe, convenient, and sustainable mode of transportation.\nThank you for your time and consideration.\nSincerely,\nMarc,\n"

What do you think will happen? Cyclists won't use random side streets that the province may like just because the province wants them to.\nE) The bureacuractic and financial strain this will put on municipalities due to having to rework their long term cycling plans, not to mention responding to the requests by the government for information on existing bike lanes - and future ones.\nAll of this utterly disappointing and ultimately tragic, as it will lead to unsafer communities and more death, all thanks to the meddling of the provincial government in a place that is (normally) outside of their scope of work.

        "comment": "Prioritizing cars over safety is not going to solve traffic issues. Making places safer to bike, therefore increasing people who bike will. It is a basic human right to be safe, and allowing more cars with more incentive to speed in town with extremely wide lanes is asking for more pedestrians and cyclists to be killed.\nMore lanes means more congestion as you remove ability for people to safely travel without cars. The environmental damage and killing of biomes is unacceptable. This idea of making things better for cars is outdated, as we can plainly see in places with more highways, more lanes never solves the problem of congestion. More infrastructure for pedestrians and cyclists means less congestions, more safety, less impact on the environment.\nFund better public transit, smaller lanes for cars, bike lanes with proper bollard separation, keep your hands off cities and towns rights to prioritize bike lanes, provide trains to rural areas and you will have the reduction of congestion as you claim this bill is seeking, but is clearly not.\n"

        "comment": "The notion that removing bike lanes will improve traffic flow is fundamentally flawed. Any driver who has driven on a road without bike lanes knows that traffic is more likely to back up behind a cyclist as everyone has to move over to safely pass by. It also ignores the fact that well connected bike infrastructure across a city, particularly on major roads that provide more direct routes, is more likely to get people on bikes and out of cars. I strongly oppose this bill and what it represents.\n"

        "comment": "Regarding the proposed amendments to Part XII: I am deeply concerned about the negative impact this legislation would have on cyclist safety and sustainable transportation initiatives in our community and across Ontario. I strongly reject the arguments presented by the Conservative government in support of this bill, which seem to be rooted in short-sighted concerns about traffic congestion and parking availability. Research consistently demonstrates that well-designed cycling infrastructure not only enhances safety for cyclists but also improves overall traffic flow and reduces congestion in the long term (Toronto Centre for Active Transportation, 2018). Additionally, studies show that businesses in areas with protected bike lanes tend to see an increase in sales, driven by greater foot and bicycle traffic (New York City Department of Transportation, 2014). These facts contradict the government\u2019s claims that bike lanes negatively impact local businesses and inconvenience motorists. I strongly urge you to remove the amendments to Part XII from Bill 212.\nFrom an avid cyclist in Stratford, Ontario\n"

        "comment": "Please do not remove existing bike lanes or block the construction of new ones. This Bill will hurt Torontonians who cycle to work or activities. The percentage of Torontonians who bike to work, school, or activities, was 44% in 2019 (and is likely much higher now). Restricting bike lanes will therefore negatively affect at least 44% of Torontonians by making biking more unsafe for them. Further, the removal of bike lanes will NOT stop cyclists, as many of them must commute along Bloor, Yonge, and University as this is where their employment is or because they are cyclists for Uber and must be in these commercial areas. People will thus continue to cycle but in a more unsafe environment. Cyclists will be forced to take up a lane of car traffic, which is bigger than a bike lane (and thus more intrusive). Transportation would then become worse for drivers AND cyclists, as drivers will be forced to maneuver around cyclists on the street (which will, inevitably, slow them down). Restricting and removing bike lanes will inevitably cause more deaths and injuries among cyclists, and worse driving conditions for drivers.\nAnother important reason that cycling infrastructure should be supported is because of its effects on businesses. An economic impact study of the bike lanes on Bloor showed that after their installation, businesses received more customers and these customers spent more money, on average. Businesses now are struggling heavily due to the effects of COVID-19 and pandemic recovery - we must do everything we can to help businesses succeed and encourage Canada's economic recovery from the pandemic. One very easy and effective way of doing this is with bike lanes.\nAdditionally, with the higher cost of living, many people cannot afford to drive to work. Cars, car maintenance, gas, and insurance, are all extremely expensive. Further, public transportation is often unreliable or slow. Thus, for people that cannot afford a car, the best alternative for them is cycling. It is often much faster for people to cycle to work than to take public transit. We should ensure that bike lanes are safe and available for these people.\nFurther, Canada is in the middle of a climate crisis. We are increasingly being affected by wildfires in our national parks and forests. We must promote alternative forms of public transportation that do not rely on fossil fuels. Cycling is the cleanest and cheapest alternative available. It should be wholly encouraged by making cycling accessible, rather than discouraged through the restriction and removal of bike lanes.\nFinally, if the aim of this Bill is to reduce traffic and gridlock, studies show that the best way of achieving this is actually through an increase in cycling infrastructure, and, cyclists! Studies have generally found that an increase in bike lanes led to a decrease in traffic, as each bicycle is one less car on the road. In contrast, increasing the amount of car lanes would lead to more drivers due to \u201cinduced demand\u201d. Basically, building car infrastructure would encourage more people to drive, and lead to more cars on the road. Therefore, this would result in NO decrease in traffic and would not help to tackle gridlock and congestion.\nPlease, I urge the Ontario government to look at bike lanes from a holistic perspective. Bike lanes are beneficial for the safety of commuters, the positive effects on businesses, their cost and efficiency over driving and taking public transit, and Canada\u2019s climate crisis. Even more, if the only goal of this Bill is to reduce traffic, studies show that an extra lane of car traffic will NOT achieve this goal. The province would thus sacrifice all of the aforementioned benefits for a goal that cannot even be achieved with this Bill. Once again, I am begging the Ontario government to take into consideration everything mentioned to understand and see the benefit of bike lanes.\n"

Local infrastructure is a municipal responsibility and this policy is an over reach in municipal authority. This new policy would delay new bike lanes and we can't afford this. Bike lanes also reduce traffic congestion and can move more people than cars. The Ontario government needs to start prioritizing active Transportation and not cars.\n"
