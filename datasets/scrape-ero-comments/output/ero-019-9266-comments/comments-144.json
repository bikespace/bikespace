        "comment": "I totally support the removal of bike lanes on major Toronto arteries , specifically in Yonge street. The current situation is appalling with respect to traffic congestion - particularly in the stretch along Yonge between roxborough and st Clair.  It will only get worse with the multitude of high density condos in Thai same stretch that the \u201ccity planners\u201d have approved\nThis area of the city  is a major residential area/neighbourhood with houses and side streets that are accessed by Yonge street. Most residents are older than 30 and have jobs and responsibilities, or children to drop to school ,etc, and many are older. bicycles are not a viable method of transportation for the majority of the local population. Left turns onto residential streets (for example like rowanwood ) can block traffic as the ridiculous bicycle lane has restricted Yonge street to one lane.\nI live on Jackes Ave - a dead end street accessed only by Yonge st. It took me 45 minutes to drive home from macpherson ave (4 traffic lights and a few blocks away) at 3:30 in the afternoon - because of the single lane restriction on a major artery. Traffic wasn\u2019t moving -there was no gridlock - drivers were polite and letting people turn - the problem is the lack of lanes to cater to the 4 cyclists I observed during the same period.\nIt\u2019s time to end the madness.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are incredibly useful to cities and residents. By making it harder to install bike lanes, we are prioritizing motorists over anyone using alternative transit, and ignoring the safety of cyclists. Studies show that bike lanes reduce traffic by offering people safe ways to travel that don\u2019t include cars. It is disappointing to see a bill like this trying to pull us backwards. We need to promote bikes through the installation of new bike lanes and allow our residents to explore other means of transit.\n"

        "comment": "Honestly, I don\u2019t even know where to start. This legislation is so near-sighted, it prioritizes convenience over safety of vulnerable road users, encourages more emissions through more people driving, is not grounded in data, and is simply a tool for political points ahead of a likely election.\nWhy are we catering to a majority of giant cars with one person inside?\nWhy are vulnerable road users being targeted for the failings of this government to deliver on transit projects on time?\nWhy are vulnerable road users being targeted when the abundance of construction projects in the city should bare the blame?\nThe city council of Toronto should govern itself and should not have a corrupt premier meddling in its affairs.\nCyclists will not stop using arteries for travel, you are simply forcing cyclists to take the lane (which will slow traffic, but ensures their safety without a bike lane). It will also result in more cyclist fatalities, with blood on the hands of the provincial government. Literal blood. Let that sink in.\nI use all of these routes during the work week (university, Yonge and Bloor) with my kid in tow. The thought have this commute becoming unsafe for us is keeping me up at night. We rely on this network. My three year old would rather not be forced to engage with traffic. Have some grace for the safety of others.\nRemoving bike lanes will have more folks turn back to cars as a way to get around, thus clogging up the streets anyways.\nUse data. Trust the city. Think of the future. Put safety first. This is not complicated.\nStay in your lane, and let cyclists have their own to stay in.\n"

They provide a mode of transportation that is great for health, the environment, and for traffic congestion by getting people out of cars who feel they are able to cycle safely. They enable children to ride their bikes. Why is the provincial government disrupting a healthy and safe option for communities?\n"

        "comment": "What a horrifically terrible idea to remove bike lanes and block future bike lanes from being built. Like most decisions DoFo makes, this legislation seems to be backed by zero evidence or logic and will create endless new issues. As a bike commuter, bike lanes are life lines and integral parts of physical and social infrastructure. To take them away and prevent new ones from being constructed, we are moving back in time and becoming less like the pedestrian-friendly cities we look up to. Is this really what we need to be spending time and resources on??? Keep your hands off our bike lanes!\n"

        "comment": "I\u2019ve driven to work, rode my bike, used public transportation and walked. Limiting how bike lanes are built with provincial oversight does not make any sense. The current prices considers research, municipal and neighbourhood feedback. If Toronto is a growing city and we don\u2019t invest in public transportation and other environmentally friendly ways, like biking, for its citizens to move around the city gridlock will only be worse. Bike lanes keep people safe. It keeps bikers safe from cars and it keeps cars safe by not being slowed down from bikers taking up the whole lane for their safety. Limiting bike lanes will reduce biker safety, increase gridlock and only further drive this \u201cdivide\u201d between bikers and drivers. Additionally trying to push through the 413 highway by making it about bike lanes makes zero sense. We appreciate you not destroying the green belt but this is putting development first over the livelihood of Ontario\u2019s residents.\n"

Cities, not Queens Park know what their roads need.  400-series highways are provincial jurisdiction, not city streets\n - bikes are not the source of our traffic problems.  Only in residential areas do they even begin to factor in the overall congestion.  And it's never as significant as school busses, dump trucks, construction vehicles, or transport trucks.\nPlease focus on making Ontario better of Ontarians ... this bill is will make things worse, not better.\n"

This is stupid, you know it's stupid, and yet you pursue stupidity.\nStop it.\nIf you were actually interested in reducing traffic congestion, you'd put Metrolinx to work properly, you'd implement gas taxes to reduce demand for personal vehicles, you toll roadways, you'd offer discounts or incentives to commuters and transport trucks to use the 407, and a host of other things that are actually under the purview of the Provincial government.\nGet to work on the things that you can actually remedy, and leave municipal decisions for municipalities to deal with.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is a terrible idea. The provincial government should focus on critical matters that affect the province (like health care, the environment, emergency services, education, and regulating trade and commerce) instead of meddling in municipal affairs. The provincial government does not have the competence nor the capacity to seriously assess the merits of bike lanes in every community in Ontario. Instead, this appears to be a populist measure that our Premier, Mr. Doug Ford and Etobicoke MPP, Christine Hogarth are pushing through with a majority government to remove specific bike lanes in Toronto that affect their personal commute. Enacting provincial legislation to deal with Toronto-specific grievances is petty and a grave abuse of power. The provincial government should focus on research-based policy making, and consider concepts like induced demand, safe streets and climate change. I firmly believe this is a significant step backward and future governments will have to unwind the damage. I encourage the government to reconsider this foolhardy, non-evidence based course of action and consider the Ontario that we want to have 5, 10, 20 and 50 years from now. It should NOT be a province where cars are king, but rather where we all have multiple transportation options, including cycling on dedicated bike lanes in major urban centres like Toronto. As my toddler grows up, I shouldn't have to explain to her that our politicians make bad decisions that are not based on evidence and are an abuse of power - I want her to be a proud Ontarian and aspire to contribute, not fight against poor decision making. This government has certainly lost my vote and more importantly, my trust.\n"

        "comment": "I live in Toronto on one of the streets off Yonge between Bloor and St. Clair.  There has been significant negative reaction to the bike lanes by my neighbours.  However, I am in favour of KEEPING these bike lanes and in fact, adding more to the city. My comments are as follows:\n- We know from international cities who are a decade ahead of Canadian municipalities on bike lanes that it takes time for usership to increase.  Therefore basing decisions on short term, point in time data from when the bike lanes are relatively new does not make sense.  It has to be based on projections (including the significant multifamily/ condo development happening along many of these corridors)... it should be noted that many of those developments are NOT putting in a lot of parking spots and as such, residents will be looking for alternative modes of transport.\n- It must be noted that if bike lanes are removed, ebikes and bikes do NOT go away, they simply get mixed with the traffic in the right hand lane.  With the increase of ebikes in the city, this causes safety issues particularly in parts of the city that are residential such as my neighbourhood.  The safety associated with the area of concern should also be taken into account along with cars.  Bike lanes offer a traffic calming effect.  There are many young children in my neighbourhood and increasing traffic just leads to safety issues and health issues.\n- Prioritizing a car culture literally makes zero sense in a growing municipality and there is significant data globally to support this.  If you build more roads, you will have more cars and in only a few years be back to the gridlock situation.  This isn't about climate, its about the economy and keeping people moving.\n- Beware of NIMBY interests.\n- Find other ways to keep traffic moving.  There are many examples globally of how to use traffic lights more effectively, separate types of users of roads (pedestrians, cars, ebikes, bikes etc.) that help traffic move.  More lanes for just cars isn't always better.\n- Let's create a world class city and actually learn from best practices globally.  It is VERY difficult to find cities that have found doubling down on roads and highways to be the best way to grow a city and get people moving irrespective of environmental interests.\n"

        "comment": "The province has no business interfering with decisions made by municipalities in areas where they have explicitly delegated powers to those municipalities. The province is not equipped to understand each and every local environment as is necessary to make decisions on local transportation elements such as bike lanes in every municipality and region, and for the province to gain that insight would be an unnecessary and wasteful duplication of bureaucracy that already exists at the municipal level. Ontarians are already represented by elected officials - their councillors, aldermen, mayors and reeves - who are capable of making decisions on the local transportation network on behalf of their constituents, without provincial interference. And if the province were interested in influencing the balance of preferential treatment between modes of transportation, there are broader approaches available that do not require such duplication and interference. Finally, the obstruction of bike lane expansion will not achieve any of the supposed goals of this legislation; bike lanes provably make roads safer for all road users, and also improve traffic conditions *for all users*, while promoting a mode of transportation that offers benefits on a wide variety of environmental and public health measures. This bill as written clearly exists solely because Premier Ford does not like bike lanes, and believes his supporters do not either. If enacted and implemented, it will serve no one other than Premier Ford, to the detriment of all road users, including motorists, and ultimately to the detriment of all Ontarians.\n"

The pro-car/anti-biking policies of this government are completely against what most city dwelling Ontarians want in their cities.\n2. Cities know best how to manage their transit infrastructure. The province should not be making wide reaching laws that add RED TAPE to new biking projects.\n3. This is plain and simple government overreach. I know that cities exist at the whim of the provincial government and that they can control a lot (like changing the number of councillors during an election, and telling them they can't use anything but FPTP), but that doesn't make it right!
