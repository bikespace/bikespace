Adding red tape to maintaining and building bike lanes is not evidence-based approach to solving gridlock. It's upsetting to see a bill named so misleadingly.\nIt's fiscally irresponsible to remove existing infrastructure without proper consensus and consultation from the residents that use them and live around them. Municipalities much more able to manage projects of this scale than the province.\nLet cities be cities. Not everyone has to live in a city, and not all places need to be cities. City residents have chosen to live there for access to the city amenities. This includes a plethora of diverse small businesses! Let us have this freedom of choice! Obstructing bike lane networks undermines the fundamental quality that makes city life viable: density!\n"

It is obvious to people living and working downtown that multiple transit options are the best way to reduce gridlock - not just prioritizing cars. Bike lanes were introduced and expanded in response to multiple cyclist deaths, and any threat to bike lanes will be moving backward and making commutes more dangerous.\n"

Is it perhaps because they saw increased business as the bloor street pilot study showed?\nThis government is talking a lot about the causes of traffic with zero evidence. Is this how we want our government run? By feelings? We \"feel\" there is more traffic in toronto so we \"feel\" bike lanes are responsible, so we \"feel\" like taking them out (and ignoring the will of the Toronto taxpayers who elected the council / mayor ).\n"

        "comment": "The governance at a provincial level is much too broad to be making decisions regarding a municipality's implementation of bike lanes. The decision of municipalities to implement bike lanes should not be decided upon or overruled by provincial authority and should absolutely remain in the jurisdiction of municipalities. Bill 212 is a severe overreach by the Province.\nSpeaking as a young professional working in the urban planning field and as a daily all-season cycling commuter, there are reams of evidence supporting the benefits of bike lanes for the well-being, health, and safety of all citizens. Bike lanes incentivize people to get active, reduce auto-dependency, and as a result is directly tied to cleaner air and human-scale neighbourhoods. Allowing the removal of bike lanes would cause more congestion incentivizing people to drive and clog up roads, as well as forcing cyclists to take up a lane's width on the road which would slow traffic further. Six cyclists have already perished on the streets of Toronto this year. Removing bike lanes would be moving backwards in our progress as a society\u2014we need more, not fewer bike lanes. Cycling infrastructure (along with alternative transportation infrastructure) make for a more equitable city, so let's make our streets safer and more enjoyable for everyone. I urge the Ministry to look at the overwhelming amount of data supporting the benefits of bike lanes and to make evidence-based decisions.\nAdditionally, this bill would allow exceptions to be made for certain projects (e.g. Highway 413) to the Environmental Assessment Act. To allow these exemptions for the sake of building faster would be negligent and irresponsible. The appropriate measures must be undertaken to ensure environmentally sustainable development. These measures are in place for accountability. I urge the Ministry to maintain its integrity and commitment to a healthy and sustainable future for all residents.\n"

That would do much more to solve gridlock.\nAs it stands, I'm increasingly convinced that the Ontario PCs are not good examples of fiscal conservatism or prudence at all. And that's not great if you want to win voters.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes and preventing the addition of new ones is a horrible idea. We need more dedicated bike lanes, preferably fully separated from motor vehicles. I'm primarily a car driver and only bike occasionally due to the lack of safe cycling infrastructure. But I'd rather drove on a single lane street with a bike lane than try to navigate a two lane street with bikes driving in the right lane and vehicles trying to pass the bike while allowing them their safe space. Then you've got the impatient drivers crowding from behind often unaware there's a cyclist present until they're right behind them. Thus setting up conditions for a vehicle-bike collision.\nAs a recent letter from the head of Beck Cabs lays out. Slow traffic on our streets is largely an issue of poor driving habits than lack of roads. The province needs to xrack down on poor driving behaviors,  perhaps a mandatory traffic school for those charged as other jurisdictions mandate. Fines and even points are no deterrent to drivers with deep pockets. Add poorly compensated delivery drivers stopping wherever they please, rather than take the time to find a legal parking spot, in order to make as many deliveries as possible and you've brought city traffic to a standstill.\n"

For as long as I can remember, Toronto has been a nightmare for car drivers BECAUSE there are NO CLEARLY MARKED bike lanes. My mother had a great deal of difficulty SEEING cyclists.\nIn Montreal, LIVES have been SAVED because of clearly demarcated bike lanes. I have almost been hit in Toronto because I was riding and the bike lane suddenly disappeared, courtesy of the Ford brother who was mayor.\nIn Montreal, I have not had that issue because of the clearly marked bike lanes. I drive a car as well. You have no idea how happy I am to have in this city clearly marked and safe bike lanes.\nI will GLADLY drive slower to accommodate cyclists, but I don't have to! Because we have so many safe and winterized bike lanes, there are LESS people driving cars.\nPlease keep the existing bike lanes in Toronto and create an actual 21st century city, with safe bike lanes everywhere.\n"

        "comment": "This legislation represents a huge step backward for Ontario.\nI need to highlight what you probably truthfully already know - The absurdity and stupidity of scapegoating bike lanes as the cause of traffic.\nHow do bike lanes on Bloor / Yonge cause the Gardiner to be backed up?\nHow do bike lanes on Bloor / Yonge cause the DVP or 401 to be backed up?\nHow does incentivizing MORE cars on the road fix car traffic?\nToronto Bike share is on track for 6 million rides this year and people choose this method of transportation because of bike lanes.\nHow would putting 6 million more trips by car on the road fix car traffic in Toronto?\nEvery study and piece of data proves this decision wrong. You mention businesses suffer yet the Bloor BIA is telling you the business is up since the bike lanes have come (https://toronto.citynews.ca/video/2024/10/24/annex-businesses-tell-ford\u2026)\nIt's also evident just by visiting other world class cities that have tons of bike Infrastructure (Paris, New York, London, Tokyo, San Francisco).  Shouldn't we be striving to be a world class city / province as well?\nHow are you so willing to throw tens of millions of taxpayer dollars down the toilet for absolutely no benefit?\nYou want to cut down on traffic?\n1.) Build more transit.\n2.) Incentive businesses downtown to offer more work from home opportunities.\n3.) Change zoning laws so people don't need to travel as far for basic goods and services.\nAll of the above are ACTUALLY proven with data to make a difference.\nWhy does this provincial government choose to govern by \"feelings\" instead of actual evidence.\nWhat will you say when traffic is just as bad or worse by going forward with this?\nBe useful, be productive. This type of garbage, populist politics aids absolutely no one and people don't forget.\n"

Having a network of bike lanes makes active modes of transportation a safer and a more viable option for road users.  If we are to reduce gridlock related to automobile traffic, viable alternatives to automobile transportation need to be available.\nWith climate change a reality, our government should be looking for ways to reduce automobile traffic, rather than making it more difficult for our citizens to engage in greener transportation modes.\nI do not agree with Bill 212.

Even though I think of returning now and then, I will never return if the Government of Ontario promotes and implements regressive and unthinking policies like this which make life more expensive for individuals by having to own multiple vehicles, makes life more expensive for Ontarians because of higher health costs due to inactivity, and has negative impacts for the environment by promoting urban sprawl and even more traffic jams.\nWith the policy and legislation like this I would never even visit Ontario again if it were not for family still living there, and when speaking to friends internationally or in Western Canada I regularly tell them to avoid visiting Ontario for the reasons of traffic and wasting their holiday.\nWith that all said, you will implement this legislation anyway regardless of the feedback. So enjoy your smaller economy, larger number of big box stores, and higher cost of living.\n"

        "comment": "To whom it may concern,\nI am writing because I am highly in opposition to the proposed addition to the Highway Traffic Act set out in Bill 212, where bicycle lanes will require Ministry approval.\nBicycle lanes encourage active transport and provides as safe space for individual to do so. By reserving a separate lane for cyclists, they no longer have to share a lane with cars, which often slows traffic flow and results in dangerous situations for both drivers and cyclists. I would also argue that bike lanes reduce accidents by decreasing bike and car interactions, which aligns with the Government of Ontario's statement that it \"Recognizes that accidents and lane closures can worsen traffic congestion and impact the quality of life of Ontarians\".\nWhile removing bike lanes may dissuade some from biking, which seems to be the goal of this policy, there will always be some who choose to bike. This may be for a number of reasons, such as cars being too expensive to afford, biking being more reasonable for short distance trips or simply because biking is more enjoyable and presents health benefits. As such, there will always be bikes on the road, whether there are bike lanes or not. This loops back to my previous arguments on safety and traffic flow.\nIn addition, given the climate emergency that we are in, how does the Government of Ontario intend to address the increased carbon emissions that would result from the implementation of this change to the Highway Traffic Act? Why is the province promoting the use of motor vehicles given the climate crisis that we face? Surely encouraging more people to use active or public transport would improve traffic flow more by reducing the number of cars on the road than adding one lane would. Carbon emissions are reduced when bike lanes are implemented because 1) some individuals choose to bike instead of drive and 2) traffic flow is smoother than if bikers and drivers shared the same lane.\nLastly, I would also like to point out that this policy steps directly into municipal jurisdiction and I believe the province should have no say in such matters. For all the reasons listed above, I urge the province not to approve this change to the Highway Traffic Act.\nI thank you for the opportunity to provide comments.\n"

        "comment": "This bill represents the completely wrong direction this province should be heading if we care about the wellbeing of the people living here. Numerous studies from around the world have continually shown the net benefits of bike lanes, from traffic times to public health to economic benefits. The impact of bike lanes on overall traffic congestions ranges from minimal negative effects to very significant positive effects. This is due to a number of factors, including decreasing car usage and increasing bike usage, and since bike lanes can move multiple times more cyclists per lane than normal traffic lanes, this leads to a reduction in traffic congestion. Bike lanes also having a calming effect on traffic, leading to fewer collisions overall. And contrary to many fears, bike lanes have actually been shown to increase sales in retail stores on roads with bike lanes. So bike lanes are simply a win-win scenario for cities, and not a convenient scape-goat for improper transport infrastructure. The bill proposes changes that will make it more difficult and tiresome to get bike lanes approved and installed, and to review current lanes, thereby decreasing bike lanes throughout the province. This is simply not the best direction for improving transport in this province. A diversity of options, including well-funded public transit, bike lanes, and walkable streets, is simply the best option to create the best cities to improve the wellbeing of all the people of Ontario.\n"
