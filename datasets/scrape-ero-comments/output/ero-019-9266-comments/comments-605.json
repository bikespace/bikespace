        "comment": "I think this is a silly reverse on all the progress Toronto has made to make it a livable city. Bike lanes are needed to lessen traffic, so people use bikes rather than vehicles. If this structure has improved cities all around the world (such as Tokyo and Beijing, two cities with far more population than Toronto.) how would our city not benifit? Bike lanes encourage citizens to stop using motorized vehicles while promoting a more eco friendly way of life. The culture doesn\u2019t change over night.\n"

        "comment": "Feedback on Bill 212- Reducing gridlock / saving your time\nI strongly oppose the parts of Bill 212 which have a focus on removing existing bike lanes and making it harder to introduce new bike lanes. This proposal totally ignores the 2024 urgent reality that we  need to manage the impacts of climate change and build communities where all people can lead connected productive lives that support our collective  well being. The answer to reducing gridlock can no longer be the increasing of car lanes and traffic flow. The only rational response at this point is to do everything in our power to make the use of public transit and alternatives such as cycling and walking safer and more attractive.\nThe proposal as outlined in the Bill has a binary focus on bike lanes vs increasing lanes for drivers of vehicles. This simplistic approach completely ignores the fact that these cycle ways and roads are part of often high density residential areas where the majority of the community are neither cycling or driving. With federal data for Bloor/Ossington showing that 36 percent of the population drive and 8.3 percent cycle the priority actually needs to be the remaining 55.3 percentage of the population and optimising the conditions for all.\nThe introduction of the Bloor west cycle lane is showing a steady increase in use by cyclists and with time this will continue. However the outstanding and more immediate benefit has been an increase in pedestrian traffic and general community use of public spaces. Encouragingly some economic benefits to these neighbourhoods is already being realised with new retail activity attracted by increased foot traffic. But there have also been significant gains in public safety and enjoyment of public spaces which are no longer dominated by multiple lanes of vehicle traffic. Having previously personally witnessed vehicle / pedestrian accidents and having had a family member impacted by a vehicle / cyclist accident the value of the traffic quietening since the introduction of the cycleways is significant. This value has not been just in the reduction of harm but in the increased community access and positive use of community spaces.\nWe would like to commend the introduction of the cycle lanes already established and urge that the significant benefits being seen are understood from a whole of community perspective. This can no longer be a single minded focus on ensuring car users can travel more quickly along roadways and must consider the needs and well being of all community members. This way we can collectively optimise our public spaces and build stronger , more cohesive , connected and resilient communities.\n"

        "comment": "I have been a cyclist in Toronto since 1986. It is my main mode of transportation. To think that the Ontario PC's want to rip out bike lanes is illogical and dangerous for the health and safety of Torontonians. This need to rip out bike lanes is not based on evidence that it will decrease travel times for cars. It will increase the risk of harm for cyclists. This bill is over reach. Mayors and councilors should have the power to determine the kinds of roads they want for their cities. Doug Ford is using his powers to seriously affect Toronto residents, and not for the better\nResearch shows that dedicated bicycle lanes are not behind perceived traffic congestion and can have many benefits. Bike Share Toronto statistics show that ridership on its network of shared bikes has increased dramatically since 2015, when 665,000 bike trips were made annually. In 2023, that shot up to 5.7 million trips.\nhttps://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5c0e5848e5274a0bf3cbe124\u2026\nIn 2016, the European Commission's CIVITAS program published a study examining traffic congestion that looked at several cities around the world. Paris went all-in on bike lanes, and it's been wildly popular. Thirty per cent of trips now are made by bike in Paris.\nhttps://epub.wupperinst.org/frontdoor/deliver/index/docId/6597/file/659\u2026\nAccording to a 2019 report looking at the impacts of bike lanes on a different stretch of Bloor Street, local businesses reported getting more customers since the lanes were installed.\nhttps://www.tcat.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Bloor-Economic-Impact-St\u2026\nThis Bill must be stopped. It makes Toronto look like we want to live in 1954, not 2024. Bike lanes, and the cyclists that use them, do NOT create congestion on roads. Cars create congestion on roads. Reduce the amount of cars and you reduce congestion. Why can't the PC's understand such simple logic?\nBike lanes save lives. How can anyone be against that truth?\n"

        "comment": "It continues to be a concern to me and citizens of Ottawa that road work is completed without the consideration of including safe bike lanes. To enable more cyclists on the road and less in their cars we need to prioritize this as one of the primary reasons Ontario\u2019s choose to drive rather than cycle is that safe routes do not always exist.\nPlease do not be regressive in this thinking. Our citizens need to know that their safety is a top priority and that they can contribute to less congestion on the streets by taking their two wheeled options to go about their daily work and play. Small pain for some, large gain for most. It is a culture shift we can\u2019t push back on with health and safety, environmental considerations and liveable cities concepts kn mind. Let\u2019s be proud of this Ontario!\n"

        "comment": "I have been a Toronto resident for the past 21 years. In 2017 I sold my car and decided I was no longer gonna get a new car. Instead, I have been relying on public transportation and during the summer months, I use my bike extensively.\nPremier Ford, I have benefited greatly from the One Fare program that your government put into action earlier this year. I am slated to save $150 a year during my weekly visits to my father in Scarborough because of this program.\nBut this new bill that you are now considering to take out bike lanes on Yonge Street is going to affect me negatively. During the summer months, I take that route to bike from home in the 401 and young area, to the University of Toronto for work. Before those bike lanes were put into Yonge Street, I never biked in that area because I was scared of the cars that zipped really fast there. Since those bike lanes were placed there, my bike ride to work has been shortened by five minutes. This allows me to get to work on time and much earlier than before, get much needed exercise, and also have the opportunity to shop and eat in that area.\nIf you take out those bike lanes, you are putting my life and the lives of all other bike riders into peril.\nIf you take out those bike lanes, you are creating a traffic situation that will result in potentially more road rage and even worse deaths as they will now be sharing the road with us bike riders.\nPlease reconsider this law. Please allow local municipalities to make decisions that they have studied in earnest for their own citizens. please support local municipalities In these decisions by helping to fund them instead of overriding their decisions. Please do the right thing, and stop this bill. Thank you.\n"

        "comment": "I am against this bill. Nikes lanes make the city safer and greener. Research show that removing bike lanes will not improve city traffic. Encouraging more people to use bikes as their primary mode of transportation WILL decrease city car traffic. And it will go a long way toward saving our planet.\nAdditionally, many people use the argument that bike lanes increase emergency vehicle response time. This has been proven to be false. Many emergency response units have stated that bike lanes have not impacted their response times.\nBut most importantly, this bill seeks to enable the construction of highway 413, a highway that premier Ford PROMISED he would not go forward with. This highway will cost millions and will destroy important ecosystems. Again, this is a bill that serves to destroy plans for a healthier planet for the sake of lining premier Ford\u2019s pockets.\nI do not support this bill and I hold Ford to his promise to heed environmental consultations against highway 413.\n"

        "comment": "Toronto has a population of almost 3 million people. Given the space restrictions of an urban environment it does not matter how much roads are expanded there will always be traffic because cars are big and take up a massive amount of space on the road, often for just a single person to travel. The only real solution to traffic is to provide alternative means of transportation like better busses, more frequent and reliable subways and SAFE easy to navigate bike lanes. Removing the bike lanes will have a negligible to negative effect on traffic and remove the forward progress towards a sustainable and reliable urban future that everyone in Toronto needs. This also says nothing about the elitist nature of prioritizing cars over bikes. Many people cannot afford a car and rely on bicycles and public transit to commute. Removing bike lanes directly endangers them for very little benefit. Please do not pass this bill, save our bike lanes, save our city.\n"

Finally, being a resident and property owner in downtown Toronto, I think it's our rights to make sure that the property tax we pay are spent to improve the quality of living for us that actually live here.\n"

        "comment": "The provincial government's decision to limit the installation of bike lanes by municipalities is not based on facts. I have several points to make as follows:\n1) Most streets do not have bike lanes, yet there is congestion and bumper-to-bumper traffic every day. This is because the cause of traffic jams is NOT bike lanes or cyclists -- it is too many motor vehicles (many with single occupants).\n2) Vehicle parking -- even along major streets, often both sides -- has removed far more vehicle lanes than bike lanes have.\n3) Research in Toronto has shown that bike lanes result in MORE business for retail and services along main streets.\n4) The government professes to want people to get home to their families. Bike lanes make streets safer for cyclists, drivers, and pedestrians because cyclists are in their own lane rather than mixing with traffic or riding on sidewalks to avoid more vehicles. This is a safety issue, at a time when Toronto has seen increased cyclist deaths. The government is further endangering cyclists by blaming them for problems they do not cause (see point 1 above), thus emboldening critics of cyclists looking for someone to blame for traffic jams.\n5) Tearing out existing bike lanes is a waste of taxpayer money regardless of which level of government pays the bill.\n6) The Transport Minister seems unaware that cyclists ride in rain, heat, cold, and light snow.\n7) Cycling is a healthy activity that is easy on infrastructure and the environment. It should be encouraged.\nIn short, bike lanes solve problems; they do not create problems.\nThank you.\n"

Getting rid of bike lanes will not make cyclists disappear; it will simply force them onto the road. This will slow traffic for everyone and increase the likelihood of car accidents. Six cyclists were killed in car accidents in Toronto this year. If this legislation is passed, that number will only go up.\n"

First, it is a gross overstep of Ontario's power over municipal authorities to impose that traffic control alterations be a matter of provincial review and approval.\nSecond, I see no indication that the premise of this bill is evidence-based. I feel uncomfortable that such a bill, that would have large implications on my sense of safety has not even implied an evidence base. I am a healthcare worker - i do not breathe without checking to make sure the practice is evidence-informed.\nIt seems like common sense that allowing cyclists to feel safe commuting every day by giving them some minute protections inspires more cyclists. It also decreases the bicycle skill threshold necessary to commute safely, so that less confindent cyclists may still use their bike to commute. I just moved to College St, and i have been so impressed with the number and variety of cyclist commuters and couriers with whom i share the lane.\nToronto's bike lanes give rise to its's food courier culture, which i have never seen so prevalent before. While i do not use any food courier services, i love that this industry is so well-supported by the infrastructure provided by toronto municipal government.\n"
