        "comment": "I was disappointed by Minister Sarkaria\u2019s comments regarding the O\u2019Connor bikeway in Ottawa. Minister Sarkaria used the O\u2019Connor bikeway as an example of a project where traffic lanes were needlessly removed from a key arterial. I strongly disagree with his statement because O\u2019Connor is an important transportation link for the community. Arterial roads are dangerous to cyclists because of high vehicle speeds and volumes and these roads are where protection for cyclists is needed most. Almost all north/south roads in downtown Ottawa are designated as arterials by the municipality and it is therefore not practical to give cyclists a safe, direct route without removing traffic lanes from an arterial. O\u2019Connor is only one example of a similar situation in many Ottawa neighbourhoods - there is no direct and efficient route other than an arterial road due to barriers like water, train tracks, or highways.\nAs financial pressures on the city of Ottawa, its residents, and its public transportation system increase, I believe it is important to provide a safe, reliable, and efficient way for residents to navigate their city. Cycling is often the only method of transportation that can be all of these things at once. I would urge the government to reverse its proposal to review existing bike lanes and veto proposed bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "This change is reckless and disregards the views of local residents and their elected representatives. Bike lanes save lives and protect people from serious injury and allow a convenient and healthy transportation option, while also allowing children and families a safe form of activity. The bike lanes on Bloor-Danforth are busy with commuters, families, recreational riders and couriers and make for vibrant communities. They are also an essential backbone of the cycling network in the city as there are no other streets nearby that extend so far and allow for connections to north-south streets.\nIn addition to protecting cyclists, bike lanes make roads less stressful for drivers, who know where cyclists will be and where to look. When driving downtown I go out of my way to drive on roads with bike lanes because it feels safer and more predictable for everyone involved. When I cycle I do the same for my own safety and convenience.\nLocal councillors, mayors and residents should make decisions about local issues.\n"

People save money by cycling and it has such little environmental impact, not to mention that removing them will be very inconvenient to everyone commuting even if they are not cycling. I want the budget to be used in a sensible way that benefits residents, and this project does not.\n"

Not to mention it's a horrible waste of public funds to destroy useful, already existing infrastructure -- funds that could be used to improve existing roads, fix bridges, put in more actual bike lanes instead of unsafe bike gutters, etc.  I don't want this precedent to be set.  If Toronto allows such stupidity, other cities in Ontario will follow.\n"

Please also consider the environmental factor more, the provincial government should be supporting more green initiatives instead of backtracking on ones currently in place. If traffic is the problem, make the public transit system better. A lot of commuters would be happy to have reliable public transportation service than another lane for cars. Additionally, closing bike lanes is going to make it unsafe for cyclists as well as pedestrians. Please reconsider this proposal.\n"

Bike lanes are important and, while having an extra lane of traffic will not reduce gridlock immensely, getting rid of existing bike lanes will make transportation much more difficult for active transportation users. This is a step in the wrong direction.\n"

Widening roads and removing infrastructure to accommodate cars will increase congestion in urban areas during rush hours. As a former resident of Downtown Toronto, those bike lanes were crucial for getting to and from my workplace. I'm sure this sentiment is shared by many others who use these lanes. Conduct proper user research before making a decision like this, please.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is dumb.\nIt's dumb because it's bad for essentially every stakeholder except perhaps the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario, which may score some political points with people who've never actually seen a bike lane. But since that's not the point of public policy, this proposal should really just go away.\nWhy is it dumb? Well, I'll tell you.\nIt's bad health policy, for one. Cycling infrastructure encourages cycling (duh), which is a great way to live longer. It also reduces collisions, which is another way to live longer. Considering that healthcare is a provincial responsibility, that seems like it should matter, particularly since there doesn't seem to be much appetite for actually investing in the healthcare system.\nIt's also bad infrastructure policy. You'll find the best research says that bike lanes often improve traffic, but since I'm not an academic, I can be pithy and sum it up like so: cars cause congestion. If you want less congestion, encourage people to do literally anything other than driving.\nIt's bad for businesses. The Bloor Annex BIA (historically not a proponent of bike lanes) issuing a statement in support is really all you need to know. After all, they poo-poohed them before they existed, had them installed in front of their stores despite their opposition, found they drove far more business than the car lanes they replaced, and are now sensibly asking to keep them *because they bring in actual paying customers*. It was my understanding the PC government was pro-business, but maybe they've made an exception for small businesses in particular? Or perhaps those owned by \"the downtown elite?\"\nIt's bad housing policy, at least for homeowners. I live in downtown Toronto, and I happen to own a ludicrously expensive house (to be clear, this isn't a good thing. Housing should be cheaper). The reason it costs many times as much as an equivalent house in, say, Caledon is because it is downtown. It turns out people pay insane amounts of money to be conveniently located next to cool stuff, and having convenient ways to get to said cool stuff is a major part of that. My house is worth more for having a bike lane on the streets near it, and I'm pissed that the government is reaching into my pocket to rob me of that.\nMore generally, cycling infrastructure complements and encourages the density the city desperately needs to address our housing shortage. Since that is also a provincial responsibility, going in the other direction on this file is a step backwards on a file that really should be moving forwards.\nFinally, it's bad government. Decisions that affect specific cities should be made by the municipal governments of those cities. That is why they exist. The provincial government has neither the mandate nor the expertise to handle this issue competently, and so it should defer to the people who do. Toronto, for example, has an entire office full of people who do cycling infrastructure for a living, and they're very good at it. The closest thing the province has is the MTO, which has never met a problem a new 10-lane highway couldn't solve.\nI really could go on, but the above seems like plenty. As for what to do instead? The places that want cycling infrastructure (like Toronto) already have plans that are the product of local democracy. How about we just let them happen without interfering and focus on things that are a) provincial responsibilities and b) need attention. My parents can't find a family doctor and I waste at least an hour a week sitting in congestion on 400-series highways, for example.\n"

        "comment": "I object to this proposal on many levels.\n1. It is a disgusting overreach by the provincial government into an issue that is clearly the remit of locally elected city councils.\n2. Removing bike lanes will make streets less safe for cyclists and drivers by forcing bike traffic to mix with cars.\n3. It will not meaningfully reduce congestion, as indicated in the province's OWN REPORT on the matter.\n4. It's a tremendous waste of money to remove bike lanes that already exist.\n5. The number one reason for traffic is too many people occupying single occupancy cars, the most space-inefficient means of transportation. Get more people onto bikes and public transit, and you'll have less traffic.\n6. We should be encouraging people to pursue active transportation like cycling. It's better for people's health, it reduces car traffic, and it reduces tailpipe emissions.\n7. Side streets aren't practical for getting from place to place-- if they were, people would be driving on them.\n8. The city and province are growing, and we can't just keep jamming in more cars. We're at the limit. The premier's ill conceived schemes to increase car use will just make traffic worse.\n9. This feels like a cynical attempt at creating an election season wedge issue to drum up support from the suburbs. Cyclists and people who live in the city are collateral.\n10. I get around in my car, on my bike, by foot, and by public transit depending on which is most convenient. I avoid driving if I can. It's a pain. I resent the government actively making my transportation options worse.\n11. The whole bike lanes thing is a distraction from the horrible 413 project, which this bill attempts to ram through without following due process.\n12. The premier should resign and run as mayor if he wants to spend time on trivial nonsense like this instead of, for instance, fixing our decrepit public health system.\n"

This proposal will only increase traffic congestion, increase injuries and deaths of cyclists, further discourage people from using an environmentally-friendly and effective means of transport, and decrease quality of life in Ontarian cities.\nI lived in the Netherlands for many years before moving back to Ontario, and I assure you: making cities more accessible and safe for biking is something to aspire to. It promotes a more vibrant city environment, benefits local businesses immensely, ameliorates air quality, and just plain makes for a better place to live.\nPlease allow municipalities to pursue bike lane projects as suits their cities, and protect and expand existing bike infrastructure infrastructure.\n"
