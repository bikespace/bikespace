        "comment": "As a tax payer and someone who chose to call Canada, specifically Ontario home, I am appalled at this proposal.\nUnder the guise of helping people this government proposes to:\n- Increase the amount of red tape and further lengthen the time it would take key infrastructure to be built. We already have a housing crisis, lets not create one on the roads.\n- Bike lanes and safe, non-vehicular pathways are essential transportation infrastructure. If the housing crisis has taught us anything, its that we need a mix of infrastructure to solve a systemic problem.\n- Canadians deserve and demand s basic standard of safety. How this proposal deems it acceptable that a 13 year old child biking with their parents should be up against large trucks and joy riders is beyond my comprehension. Perhaps if I hated Ontario as much as the premier does I could understand.\n- Drivers shouldn't need to share the road if it can be helped! Lets get people who could be the most harmed out of their way onto bike lanes so that driving is less stressful, and safer for everyone. Especially hard working delivery drivers who often have large vehicles with limited visibility.\n- Bike lanes extended and support existing transit infrastructure. They enable people who cannot otherwise afford vehicles or specifically choose to use bikes. Why is this governments stance to remove choice from people?\nI sincerely hope this entire proposal is scrapped. There is no value in removing infrastructure that is being used and I certainly don't want to pay for it, even if the premiere has some very good friends lined up to scoop up those tenders.\nFurthermore, the sighting of specific roads in Toronto is a huge over step of the provincial government. If you care that deeply about Toronto, work with the Toronto mayor instead of strong arming, posturing and ultimately bullying.\nIf you care that deeply about Toronto, does that mean you don't care deeply about my home town? Why is there no specific changes listed for Welland, Thunder Bay, Orillia, Barrie?\n"

        "comment": "Dear Premier Ford\nI would like to register my strong opposition to the proposed Bill 212 as it is currently written.  My concerns are as follows:\nIT IS WASTEFUL - Ripping out bike lanes will cost nearly $50 million dollars of MY TAX MONEY - not to mention MORE congestion while that happens AND loss of business for those on the affected streets. It's not just a matter of scraping off paint - they are built into pavement. For a government that says it supports business, why are you not listening to actual businesses that have had business IMPROVE after bike lanes went in?\nIT IS DANGEROUS - Without physical separation, cyclists - and pedestrians - are at the mercy of Toronto drivers. Cyclists include families, doctors and hospital staff, commuters, students and profs, delivery drivers, and the disabled.  Our safety is worth more than a few minutes saved for car drivers. Everyone deserves safe streets!  I need the cycle lanes on University to get my cancer treatments at Princess Margaret - why would you put a cancer patient at further risk? Or perhaps you want me to use a car to get there?\nIT IS IMPRACTICAL - The Premier suggests cyclist use side streets.  For very short neighbourhood trips this may work, but for those travelling over the city's many rivers, highways, and rail tracks - not to mention those with destinations ON main streets - they are insufficient; it's often impossible not to use main streets.   Cyclists need to and are entitled to use all streets in Toronto to get to their destinations safely.\nIT DOESN'T SOLVE THE ISSUE OF CONGESTION - Of course converting mixed lanes into cycle lanes mean less room for cars; however, the impact on travel times is negligible.  Many other factors are causing traffic jams, including: lack of reliable transit alternatives, too many Ubers and delivery vehicles, massive amounts of construction all throughout the city, and basically too many cars.  Removing bike lanes will have very little impact on most traffic - and may end up adding more cars as cyclists choose instead to drive or Uber. (When people have no safe way to cycle, and the transit options are poor due to underfunding, they will drive or Uber - one more car each trip!  More congestion!) Moreover, historical data shows conclusively that adding a lane of traffic does not ease gridlock, as it merely attracts more cars. Ripping out bike lanes will still leave drivers angry and fuming as they sit there in traffic.\nIT IS BASED ON FEELINGS NOT FACTS - The Transportation Minister can cherry pick numbers all he wants but claiming only 1% of Toronto commuters cycle is false and misleading. If he chose to look at actual current relevant information her would see that  TORONTO commuters choose to cycle in huge numbers, that Bike Share rentals are way up, and that the new lanes on Yonge, University and Bloor are very heavily used.  To cite 10 year old data that applies to the whole GTA is not only disingenuous, it is BAD FAITH. In fact, the city has undertaken considerable time, energy and money to plan and consult on all bike lanes.  Suggesting that they are \"poorly installed\" is an insult to the thousands of hard working staff and volunteers who spent years very carefully planning and building them.\nIT IS NOT THE PROVINCE'S LANE - Local traffic should be decided by local authorities. Not everyone has to like it, but at least our city's processes are democratic.  The province reacting impulsively to the complaints of a handful of PC donors is not.  Your government needs to attend to its own issues, including housing and health care.\n"

She loved it, I could see it opened up her mind for what is possible for getting around Toronto and I felt safe following her on the route. Please don't take this away. My niece has to take a sidewalk for part of her bike to school and has caused many near misses with angry pedestrians. Cyclists need a safe arterial connection through the city and should not be provided circuitous routes that are longer than direct ones. Removal of bike lanes may inadvertently result in bike users using sidewalks impacting all pedestrians, including people with disabilities.\n"

One time a large SUV  almost hit me as it was racing through Thompson Ave to avoid waiting for a right turn at Royal York 500 metres away.   This didn\u2019t happen before the lanes were reduced.  It would have always been much longer to use the residential streets compared to Bloor.

        "comment": "I am strongly opposed to Bill 212 and the Highway 413 Act, 2024.\nI\u2019ve never owned a car and don\u2019t ever plan to, primarily for environmental and health reasons. I also live in Toronto\u2019s west end and don\u2019t need a car - I\u2019m fortunate to live near a subway station and walk or bike whenever I\u2019m able. Cycling has increasingly been my main mode of transportation for the last couple of decades and since I live right off Bloor, I bike on it almost daily as I commute, run errands, visit family and friends and shop at local businesses. The protected bike lane along Bloor have made my bike rides so much safer and have enabled many more people, including my dad and nephews, to be able to travel more safely on two wheels. My 68 year-old dad, who also lives near Bloor, used to drive everywhere, but after getting an e-assist bike a few years ago, his main mode of transportation is his bike and it\u2019s enabled him to see the city with completely new eyes - he\u2019s logged over 5,000 km this year! Like for me, biking has been so good for his physical and mental health, not to mention saving money and contributing to a cleaner environment. My dad admits that there\u2019s no way he would be biking if it weren\u2019t for all the safe cycling infrastructure the City of Toronto installed over the last several years.\nI know that there\u2019s some opposition to some bike lanes in Toronto, but the reality is that we cannot all drive. There\u2019s just too many of us in this rapidly growing city and the planet is getting increasingly hotter every year. Just like many of us put on masks and got vaccinated during the pandemic for the greater good (i.e. to protect the public), those of us who are able to, ought to consider alternatives to driving, whether it\u2019s walking, biking, taking transit, etc. for the health and safety of people and the planet.\nCongestion is bad in Toronto, but numerous studies and historical data have shown that removing bike lanes will not ease congestion. More importantly, removing bike lanes will cause more injuries and fatalities. Bike lanes don\u2019t just protect cyclists - they make streets safer for pedestrians and drivers too. Why would the Ontario government pass legislation that puts lives at risk? So drivers can save a few minutes? Already six people have been killed riding their bikes in Toronto this year (more than the previous three years combined) and as Doug Ford himself said in 2017, \u201cone death is way too many\u201d.\nI am also deeply concerned about the plan to fast-track the construction of Highway 413, including exempting it from the Environmental Assessment Act. This highway will destroy thousands of acres of farmland and hundreds of acres of Greenbelt, causing irreversible harm to lands that are vital for protecting our air, water, and wildlife. Highway 413 will also increase greenhouse gas emissions, further exacerbating the climate crisis. Transportation is already the largest source of emissions in Ontario, and this project will lock us into decades of higher emissions.\nMoreover, Highway 413 won\u2019t solve congestion, but will in fact make it worse. Experts around the world have proven that building more highways leads to induced demand, creating more traffic and pollution. If we want to reduce gridlock, we need to focus on investing in alternatives to driving, like public transit and cycling infrastructure. These alternatives will also reduce emissions and improve public health, while supporting the local economy.\nIn summary, Bill 212 is a huge step backward for Toronto and the province as a whole. I urge you to reconsider and prioritize investments that protect our environment and health while addressing congestion in meaningful ways.\n"

        "comment": "Re: City of Brampton's Response to ERO 019-9266 Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024 - Framework for bike lanes that require removal of a traffic lane.\nThank you for the opportunity to comment on the proposal of Bill 212 - Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024 - Framework for bike lanes that require removal of a traffic lane, posted by the Ministry of Transportation on the Environmental Registry of Ontario (ERO 019-9266). On behalf of the City of Brampton, we appreciate the Province\u2019s commitment to improving transportation across Ontario and welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important dialogue.\nBrampton has been steadily advancing its active transportation infrastructure in line with local policy directions and best practice standards, guided by a strong commitment to sustainability, urban growth management, and multi-modal mobility. We are pleased to report that our efforts align closely with the objectives of the 2024 Provincial Policy Statement (PPS), which emphasizes sustainable and active transportation as critical components of community development.\nThe following sections present Brampton\u2019s local policies and initiatives related to active transportation infrastructure and the context within which we have been working to achieve the implementation of an integrated, multi-modal network that will support the city\u2019s growth and development.\nBrampton Plan\nBrampton\u2019s Official Plan (Brampton Plan), endorsed by Council in November 2023, contains clear commitments to advancing active transportation as a key part of its vision for a sustainable, livable, and connected city. The plan integrates active transportation with broader objectives related to environmental responsibility, community health, and economic vibrancy.\nAs Brampton transitions from a car-oriented suburb to an urban city over the next 30 years through intensification and infill development, there needs to be a greater emphasis on sustainable modes of transportation. The Plan establishes a mode share target of 11% for active modes of transportation.\nBrampton Plan is committed to reducing car dependency by making active transportation a viable and attractive alternative. The development of a safe and accessible active transportation network to encourage cycling, walking, and other non-motorized travel modes includes the implementation of bike lanes to help connect residential areas to key destinations like schools, workplaces, and transit hubs.\nBrampton is one of Canada\u2019s fastest-growing cities, and encouraging active transportation is a crucial strategy to manage this growth sustainably. The implementation of bike lanes that involve motor vehicle lane reduction is one of many of our approaches to increase mobility options, road safety, and ultimately fighting congestion and urban sprawl, both of which challenge the vision of a well-planned, transit-oriented, and compact community. We hope that Bill 212 will not compromise the ongoing efforts Brampton has been working on to effectively foster a shift away from car dependency in order to achieve its sustainability goals.\nOn the Move: Brampton Mobility Plan\nThe Brampton Mobility Plan is currently under development and is designed to shape the future of mobility in Brampton. This comprehensive plan aims to integrate various modes of travel\u2014including walking, cycling, and public transit\u2014into a cohesive, efficient, and accessible system that meets the city\u2019s long-term growth, environmental, and public health goals.\nThe plan will recommend policies, infrastructure and programs needed to achieve Brampton\u2019s vision of a transportation system that is a mosaic of safe, integrated transportation choices and new modes contributing to civic sustainability with an emphasis on walking, cycling, and transit.\nAmong its guiding principles, Brampton Mobility Plan includes enhancing mobility and travel options for people and goods, advancing equity within the transportation system, improving the environmental sustainability of the transportation system, protecting and enhancing public health and safety, and leveraging emerging transportation technologies.\nBy 2051, Brampton is expected to grow by 430,000 people (+66%) and 200,000 jobs (+88%). As a result of this growth, future travel demand is expected to grow by 185,000 trips (+62%) by all modes in the morning peak period. Today, most trips in Brampton are made by car. If current trends continue, by 2051 an additional 150,000 car trips will be made in the morning peak period.\nAs Brampton continues to grow, more emphasis needs to be placed on sustainable modes of travel. If we achieve the mode share targets of Brampton Plan, we can reduce future car travel by nearly 70,000 trips. The Mobility Plan, aligned with Brampton Plan\u2019s growth management strategies, encourages a compact, transit-oriented urban form that prioritizes active and public transit over car dependency. The ability to reallocate traffic lanes for bike infrastructure is essential for supporting high-density areas where car-focused infrastructure is inefficient and unsustainable.\nThe City\u2019s policies on multi-modal mobility support a transportation system where cycling, walking, and transit are seamlessly connected. Bike lanes play a pivotal role in offering Brampton residents viable options beyond car use. Constraints on bike lane development would reduce transportation choice and flexibility, forcing continued reliance on private motor vehicles and hindering Brampton\u2019s efforts to efficiently use limited road space towards an integrated, multi-modal network as envisioned in the Mobility Plan.\nBrampton\u2019s Active Transportation Master Plan\nThe City of Brampton\u2019s Active Transportation Master Plan provides the network plan, policies and programs to support Brampton\u2019s 2040 Vision for a mosaic of safe, integrated transportation choices and new modes, contributions to civic sustainability, and emphasizing walking, cycling, and transit. Active transportation (walking, cycling and other self-propelled mobility options) presents one of the greatest untapped opportunities for reducing single occupant vehicle trips, and for addressing a host of community design and public health issues.\nThe Active Transportation Master Plan focuses on the implementation strategy for building a connected cycling and pedestrian network across the City (and connecting to neighbouring municipalities) to enable safer, more convenient travel by non-motorized modes, and to encourage cycling as a viable means of transportation for both recreational and utilitarian purposes for the general public.\nBrampton\u2019s ATMP prioritizes expanding and enhancing cycling infrastructure to make biking a viable, safe, and appealing mode of travel for all residents. To meet this goal, the plan relies on the strategic addition of bike lanes, including in areas where reallocating car lanes is necessary to create dedicated, continuous routes.\nRestrictions on Brampton\u2019s ability to create these critical corridors, especially in high-demand urban areas where road space is limited could compromise our network\u2019s future. This would lead to a fragmented cycling network that fails to provide safe, direct routes and discourages residents from considering cycling as a practical travel option, countering the plan\u2019s goal of normalizing active transportation.\nBrampton Grow Green Environmental Master Plan\nIn 2019, Brampton Council declared a climate emergency and the need for a more sustainable transportation system given that 59% of Brampton\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions originates directly from the transportation sector. Brampton's Environmental Master Plan and Sustainable Community Development Guidelines emphasize reducing greenhouse gas emissions by decreasing vehicle dependency. Bike lanes are critical in promoting alternative modes of transportation that reduce emissions.\nThe City is also developing its first Climate Change Adaptation Plan to help reduce our vulnerabilities to climate change through a series of recommended actions that will improve our resiliency and ensure communities are prepared for future impacts. Restricting the methods by which the City is able to implement bike lanes could pose a significant barrier to achieving this by limiting the development of active transportation infrastructure and incentivizing car use, which would deter Brampton\u2019s progress toward emissions reduction targets by limiting low-emission options and climate-resilient transportation solutions.\nBrampton Complete Streets Guide\nThe goal of a Complete Streets approach is to create roadways that are inclusive and promote equitable use, whether people are walking, cycling, driving, or using public transit. This design philosophy is especially focused on making streets safe for vulnerable users, including children, older adults, and people with disabilities. The Brampton Complete Streets Guide is a planning and design resource that provides the guidelines for designing streets to be safe, accessible, and accommodating for all types of users. The Guide currently informs all our road designs exercises and will further serve as the basis to our Engineering and Design Standards review moving forward.\nSome key elements present in this approach include designing streets that support diverse transportation modes\u2014walking, biking, driving, public transit, and other emerging forms of mobility, like scooters, and elements such as protected bike lanes, wider sidewalks, pedestrian crossings, and traffic calming measures to enhance safety and reduce the risk of collisions. Emphasis on creating barrier-free environments that accommodate people of all ages and abilities and guidance on adapting street cross sections based on context, such as the surrounding land use, density, and traffic volumes; are also part of the Complete Streets lens that Brampton currently adopts.\nThe benefits of the Complete Streets approach involve improved safety by reducing collisions and fatalities through a safer environment for pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers, increased mobility options, and promotion of sustainability and public health. It is important to consider all solutions available when developing this type of supportive infrastructure, including traffic lane reallocation, potentially increasing opportunities that encourage active lifestyles, safety and traffic congestion reduction.\nVision Zero\nThe Region of Peel's Vision Zero Road Safety Strategic Plan aims to eliminate traffic-related fatalities and serious injuries on roads by promoting safer, more accessible streets for all users. Rooted in the \"Vision Zero\" philosophy\u2014no loss of life is acceptable\u2014the strategy focuses on engineering, education, enforcement, and evaluation to create a safer transportation environment across the Region.\nBrampton\u2019s Council passed a resolution in 2019 to adopt the Vision Zero road safety framework in how streets are designed and operated. Current initiatives to improve safety for pedestrians, cyclists and motorists on Brampton\u2019s roadways, sidewalks and walkways include automated speed enforcement, schools safety programs, community safety zones and traffic calming measures, which incorporate bike lane implementation as a way of reducing traffic lane widths to discourage speeding, in addition to provide a safer designated space for cyclists. The ability to implement bike lanes that could require traffic lane reductions can allow safe active transportation options, ultimately improving the safety of vulnerable road users.\nE-scooter Pilot Program\nThe City of Brampton recognizes the importance of embracing innovative transportation options that expand mobility, promote sustainability, and align with our long-term strategic vision of build more connected communities and provide more sustainable transportation options for everyone. Since the beginning of the Province\u2019s pilot project in 2020, we have observed how e-scooters can serve as a convenient, eco-friendly solution to first and last-mile travel.\nBrampton\u2019s Shared E-scooter Pilot Program, the first launched in the GTA, aims to test and integrate e-scooters into public spaces, and is closely related to bike lane infrastructure, as bike lanes offer safe, designated spaces for e-scooters to operate. Since e-scooters and bicycles travel at similar speeds, bike lanes provide an ideal path for both modes, reducing conflicts with pedestrians and cars. Integrating e-scooters into bike lanes also promotes multimodal options, as shared infrastructure can support both bikes and e-scooters.\nIn Brampton, the shared program has reached around 350,000 trips with 40% of users reporting using e-scooters mostly to connect to public transit. Advancing and improving our active transportation network with the implementation of bike lanes that provide a safe and direct connection to destinations, but also to transit stops and terminals is fundamental to achieve the multi-modality of our transportation system.\nThe Pilot Program, we understand, has benefited from our existing bike lane network as the data shows bike lanes as the preferred routes by e-scooter users. The initiative, in our view, encourages municipalities to enhance their bike lane networks to accommodate various micromobility options, improving accessibility and safety for diverse users, including on roads where bike lanes were the result of repurposed traffic lanes.\nSocial and Economic Development and Urban Vitality\nAll of Brampton\u2019s policies, envision a future where active transportation infrastructure supports economic growth and urban vibrancy. A robust network of bike lanes can attract businesses, increase foot traffic, and create dynamic, people-focused spaces that boost local commerce. Cities that prioritize bike-friendly infrastructure often see local economic benefits, as the use of active transportation is correlated with communities that are more attractive for businesses, residents, and visitors alike.\nBike lanes contribute to equity by making streets safer and more accessible for everyone, particularly lower-income individuals who may rely on bicycles for affordable transportation. They help reduce transportation costs, improve access to jobs, schools, and essential services, and promote health by encouraging physical activity. In areas with bike infrastructure, the reduced reliance on cars also means less pollution and improved air quality, which often benefits underserved communities facing higher pollution levels. Inclusive bike lanes, accessible to diverse riders of all ages and abilities, help create more equitable and connected communities.\nBike lane expansion, especially in urban areas where lane reallocations may be necessary, increases Brampton\u2019s ability to create business-friendly, bike-accessible districts, increasing the potential for economic activity and urban vitality that is central to economically resilient communities. The focus on promoting mobility equity favouring all road users (estimates are that 30% of people don\u2019t have access to driving due to age, ability, or access) should include the implementation of bike lanes that provide opportunities for those who still need reliable and safe options to travel across our communities.\nAlignment with Provincial Goals\nThe 2024 PPS highlights the importance of integrating active transportation systems to reduce emissions, alleviate congestion, and support compact, efficient growth. Our policies\u2014such as the Brampton Plan, the Brampton Mobility Plan, and the Active Transportation Master Plan\u2014are designed to foster these very principles. Through these frameworks, Brampton is working to transition from a car-dependent city to a dynamic, transit-oriented urban center, supported by a safe and accessible network of active transportation options.\nBrampton's strategic plans prioritize active transportation as a viable and attractive alternative to car travel. Our policies focus on creating complete streets that accommodate all users and integrating cycling infrastructure with public transit to improve first- and last-mile connectivity. Initiatives like Vision Zero and the E-scooter Pilot Program further illustrate our commitment to fostering a safer, more inclusive transportation system for all road users.\nIt is important to note that reallocating traffic lanes to support active transportation infrastructure is a critical tool for achieving these outcomes, especially in high-density areas where road space must be used efficiently. Limiting this ability could challenge municipalities like Brampton in meeting both local and provincial transportation and climate goals.\nSupporting Evidence-Based Policy\nThe City of Brampton has implemented approximately 26 km of bicycle lanes through \u201croad diets\u201d \u2013 reallocation of vehicular traffic lanes \u2013 on over-designed four-lane collector roads. These roads, often underutilized, were redesigned to reduce excessive capacity, calm traffic, and improve safety for all users. Road diets in Brampton have successfully decreased vehicle speeds, traffic volumes, and collisions, while redirecting non-local traffic to more appropriate routes.\nAppendix 1 provides a detailed breakdown of the traffic metrics collected from five key corridors in the City and show reductions in travel time and operating speed, ranging from 5% to 31% and 7% to 23% respectively, indicating improved traffic operation conditions and enhanced safety. In addition, cycling numbers have been increasing year by year and the utilization of our bike lanes have also been popular with micromobility users with around 17% of total e-scooter rides from our program taking place on these corridors\u2019 bike lanes and 60% of them starting or ending within 500 metres of the same corridors in the last year.\nAlso shown in Appendix 2, data from our E-scooter Pilot Program reveal that these corridors are among the most travelled routes used by riders in the City with over 17% of all trips taking place specifically on these bike lanes\u202fand around 60% of total rides starting or ending within 500 metres of the same corridors.\nThese results demonstrate Brampton\u2019s commitment to creating safer, multi-modal streets that balance the needs of all road users, consistent with provincial goals. Investments in bike lanes, particularly those involving reallocation of road space, have been shown to enhance safety, improve connectivity, and support reduced reliance on single-occupancy vehicles.\nBrampton's efforts are supported by robust data and research, which show that investments in active transportation reduce congestion and emissions while promoting healthier, more vibrant communities. Our initiatives align with the evidence-based strategy outlined in the proposed framework of Bill 212, while including the promotion of mobility equity and sustainable urban development. We are confident that any additional plans Brampton has of implementing bike lanes that would involve the reallocation of traffic lanes will continue to follow an evidence-based approach and meet the requirements for traffic flow reporting under Bill 212.\nCollaboration for a Sustainable Future\nThe City of Brampton believes that municipalities are well positioned to design and implement transportation solutions that meet local needs and align with both, local and provincial priorities. We encourage ongoing collaboration with the Ministry of Transportation to ensure that the framework of Bill 212 supports best practice and innovation while addressing gridlock.\nAlthough the Ministry did not present any data to support the assertion that bike lanes contribute to congestion and gridlock, we would like to reiterate that all our active transportation projects have always been supported by both research and practice evidence and that monitoring and evaluation are a continuous part of our process.\nIn summary, Brampton is ready to keep following the 2024 Provincial Policy Statement\u2019s priorities for active transportation, transit integration, and environmentally sustainable growth through its local policies and initiatives while supporting a balanced evidence-based approach to develop its cycling network towards reducing gridlock and advancing essential urban planning and environmental goals.\nFinally, the City of Brampton believes that the authority and autonomy of municipalities in designing and implementing infrastructure under its jurisdiction is the best way to address local priorities and avoid unnecessary bureaucracy over the decision-making process.\nWe appreciate your consideration of these comments and value our ongoing partnership in advancing sustainable transportation options in Ontario. We look forward to collaborating with MTO in ensuring that the implementation of bike lanes is supported by an evidence-based approach that follows the state of the art and practice in fostering a safe and sustainable mobility system for all road users.\nCity of Brampton\n"

I have been biking for 15 years in Toronto and I feel 1000% safer today than when I first started. This is because of the the bike lanes and biking community that has grown leaps and bounds.

        "comment": "Doug Ford's Bill 212, aimed at removing bike lanes that occupy one lane of traffic, is deeply misguided and fails to address the real causes of gridlock in Ontario\u2019s cities. Traffic congestion is caused primarily by an overabundance of cars, not by cyclists or bike lanes. Bike lanes play a crucial role in reducing gridlock by encouraging people to shift from driving to cycling, a more efficient and sustainable mode of transportation. Removing bike lanes would force more cyclists back into cars or unsafe conditions, exacerbating traffic congestion and reducing road safety.\nAdditionally, bike lanes contribute to healthier cities by improving air quality and encouraging active transportation. Studies consistently show that cities with robust cycling infrastructure experience fewer traffic delays and higher road efficiency as bikes take up significantly less space than cars. Ford\u2019s decision to scapegoat bike lanes as a source of gridlock ignores these facts and undermines efforts to make Ontario's urban areas more livable and environmentally sustainable. This move highlights a lack of vision from the Ford government, which should focus on comprehensive transit solutions rather than shortsighted policies that prioritize car dependency.\n"

        "comment": "As residents, pedestrians, drivers and cyclists of Toronto, we are writing to express our strongest opposition to Bill 212 that will create more hazardous roads, increase air and noise pollution without solving the congestion problem the city faces. We also believe the proposed legislation is a direct disregard to local democracy and governance as it rushes to conclusion before reasoning, and represents an unprecedented jurisdictional overreach into local affairs, particularly the largest, most diverse and financially important city in Ontario.\nRemoving bike lanes by legislation will increase congestion. The added construction will add travel time to both drivers and cyclists alike. Also, there is no data or evidence that supports that removing bike lanes on University, Yonge and Bloor will decrease driving time when a lot of the congestion is caused by construction and more cars on the road. It is also wasteful and fiscally irresponsible to spend taxpayer money to tear out newly constructed infrastructure.\nRemoving bike lanes is bad for business, particularly small businesses on the bike lanes that will bear the impact. This will lead to a loss of patrons as the roads are torn up. Additionally, as the Annex BIA stated, cyclists have more frequent and spontaneous stops along their route that will lead to more customers. Building the street as wide as possible for thoroughfare means more cars travelling through, not more business.\nCyclists and drivers will be endangered by the inevitable mixed traffic. Cyclists will always exist, whether you give them bike lanes or not. There will only be more cyclists as more people move to the large cities. Additionally, the principle of induced demand also means that simply by having an additional lane it will not necessarily lead to better travel times. This is particularly true as the legislation potentially forces more drivers onto the road because they have no alternative mode of transportation but to drive.\nCycling is part of the fabric of the transit system that will connect the last mile of transit use, especially considering how we have underinvested in subways and heavy rail transit in the past decades. While the historic investment into public transit by this government is laudable, it is also late. In any case, we still need micro mobility transport modes to connect transit users to their final destinations. With the booming population of Ontario and Toronto, more people are cycling not only to commute, but also to visit friends, families and businesses. The statistics of 1.2% of commuters being cyclists is misleading and outdated from 2011 when in fact we need more up to date statistics that encompasses all journeys, not just commuting. Particularly in large downtowns like that of Toronto, more density in housing and population simply means there is no room for everyone to drive for every trip. Cycling takes up less space and is more efficient at moving people in dense urban areas when we are facing an acute housing crisis. It seems folly to think devoting more space to roads is the solution to our population and housing problem when we simply do not have enough space for everyone to drive for every purpose.\nWe, the undersigned, implore you to pause Bill 212 that would make cities in Ontario, including Toronto, less safe, accessible, and livable for all residents.\nSincerely,\nLeslieville Citizen\n"

The province (aka the premier) needs to butt out of micromanaging Toronto's affairs and stick to important provincial jurisdictional issues like health care and education.\n"
