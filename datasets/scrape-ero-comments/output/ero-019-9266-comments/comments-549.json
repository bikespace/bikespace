        "comment": "I am writing to express my concerns regarding the recent legislative amendment that mandates Ministry approval for bicycle lane designs in specific municipal situations, as outlined in Bill 212. This requirement, I believe, represents a significant overreach into matters that should rightly fall within municipal jurisdiction, potentially undermining local autonomy and responsiveness to community-specific needs.\nThe decision to implement or adjust bicycle lanes within a municipality is best guided by local officials who understand their unique infrastructure, traffic flow, and urban planning strategies. Requiring provincial oversight adds an unnecessary layer of bureaucracy, resulting in more red tape, additional delays, and increased costs that ultimately burden taxpayers. Municipalities already face a rigorous planning process when considering changes to roadways and should retain the authority to manage their infrastructure without interference from provincial mandates.\n"

        "comment": "None of the bike lanes currently in Toronto should be removed. These bike lanes take up a fraction of space in a city whose streets are almost entirely devoted to cars. Most streets in Toronto do not have bike lanes, so removing them will not open up an appreciable amount of lanes. Any  room opened up by removing bike lanes will be immediately taken up by the increased number of car commuters. Instead of trying to remove bike lanes, the government should focus on the real source of congestion - cars, which take up too much space and pollute our air. Don't cater to cars, enforce measures which reduces the number of cars on the road.\nRemoving bike lanes will put those who currently commute by bike out on the road where we will impede traffic. Notably, it will put the food delivery electric bikes out on the streets. Do car drivers really want to share the streets with bikes weaving in and out of traffic? Moving bike traffic to secondary streets is not a solution because 1) there aren't very many of them and 2) those that exist do not provide direct routes through the city.\nWho is this change going to benefit? Business owners on Bloor Street do not want the bike lanes removed - they have increased foot traffic and improved revenues.\nMoreover, the amendment to require provincial approval on any new bike lanes is an abuse of power. The people of Toronto democratically elected our mayor and city councillors based on their plans and policies for the city - the province should not be allowed to overrule that. Money has just been spent installing the new bike lanes - why is the provincial government now spending more taxpayer dollars to remove them?\n"

It also wrongly demonizes cyclists, who have every right to safely use the roads as any driver.\nCars cause congestion. Most of them single-occupant and oversized vehicles \u2013 which are then left to sit idle in taxpayer-subsidized curbside parking! Look at any video of the Bloor Street bike lane and note how many cars are taking up a full lane just by being parked there, instead of in the abundant off-street parking.\nThis policy will kill and injure cyclists, just to score points with the government's rural PC base.\n"

I need to be at the hospital for emergencies, and biking is by-far the fastest mode of transportation for me.  Literal lives are at risk if I am delayed.   Removing the existing bike lanes delays me and my colleagues.\nBike lanes on streets like Bloor-Danforth have proven vital for safe commuting.

Removing bike lanes won\u2019t actually reduce cyclists on the road, it will just put them in harms way and increase driver frustration. It will not improve traffic congestion.\nFourth, interfering with municipal plans seems like gross overreach. Municipalities have been developing and implementing cycling infrastructure based on evidence \u2013evidence that cycling infrastructure saves lives, is good for local business, and does not actually have much if any impact on commute times for car drivers. Arguably, more bikes on the road, means less cars.\nFifth, presumably the Ontario government has policy analysts that advise on such matters. It would seem that the ministers and the premier are either not asking their analysts for evidence or willingly ignoring the evidence provided.\nSixth, we elect governments because we believe they will enact policy that is progressive and benefits the population as a whole. This Bill 212 is a disappointment. You can do better.\n"

Congestion is more caused by parked cars and construction occupying the right lane, limiting lanes of traffic and causing more lane changes\n2. Cyclists will continue to occupy roads but without a dedicated lane, will establish the speed of traffic thus slowing motorists\n3. Danger to cyclists increases\nAn article in the Globe and Mail flagged the five biggest travel bottlenecks in the GTA and none are close to the proposed bike lanes the Provincial Government wants to remove. It also highlights a studies that found increased road capacity does not relieve a city's traffic burdens (i.e., encourages more to use cars) and construction is main culprit.\nIn an era where more world class cities are expanding biking infrastructure to improve wellness and flexibility and combat climate change, this feels like a regressive approach that will make our roads more dangerous.\n"

I am able to cycle and keep my car off the streets because of bike lanes.  They are not always safe due to bad drivers, but it's safer then taking the lane with cars. I am a competent cyclist, but I am scared of the prospect of taking the lane with cars.  There is no real enforcement downtown of bad drivers. The police do not have the resources to do this.\nIf you remove bike lanes not only will you add more cars to the city traffic, people will die.\nYour statistic that 1.2% of people cycle to work is wrong, I don't know where this data came from. Cycling to work is not the only reason people cycle.  Maybe those numbers too? Maybe finish the Eglinton cross town so that the suburban people have a reliable none car mode of transportation to get into town?\n"

Adding automotive infrastructure only adds to volume and gridlock.\nThe Ontario government needs to direct a higher percentage of the transport budget away from automobile centric projects such as Hwy 413 and Hwy 401 tunnel and direct it to massively increasing public transit service across the GTA/Golden Horseshoe.  The government needs to mandate that all road infrastructure projects include access for passive transit including  cycle and pedestrian access.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lane approval has always been a municipal decision and not a provincial decision. Adding provincial red tape hinders the ability of municipalities and local communities across Ontario to make their own decisions.\nThis act increases the expenses of municipalities, without providing them any type of financial aid. Municipalities in Ontario are already hurting financially, yet will be required to 'facilitate' the removal of bike lanes in their municipality. Removing existing bike lanes is an expensive endeavor, and there are better uses of tax payer dollars.\nRemoving bike lanes will increase healthcare costs - both through decreased safety for cyclists, but also increased air pollution for cyclists, pedestrians and drivers. Studies have shown that when you remove a lane of traffic and add a bike lane, the levels of NO2 decrease for bicyclists. Long-term and high-dose NO2 exposure can lead to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, lung cancer and increased susceptibility to respiratory infections. The provincial government should be trying to reduce our healthcare costs, not increase them, by working on solutions that decrease air pollution and promote healthy physical activity like cycling.\nFinally, this act is not being executed in good faith. On one hand it says it would require municipalities to submit information about existing bike lanes where an existing vehicle lane was removed, and based on the outcome of the review they might require the removal of the bike lane; on the other hand, the act clearly states that they are removing the bike lanes on Bloor St, University Ave and Yonge St (without any review or data to back it up).\n"

        "comment": "Hello. I am a resident in Bloor West Village and would like to comment on the proposed changes which will remove the recently installed bike lanes.\nI primarily commute to work via TTC, and am also an occasional cyclist. However, I am strongly OPPOSED to the bike lanes in their current form, and fully support the proposal to remove them. My reasoning is:\n1. The bike lanes do not represent an efficient use of space. Effectively they have reduced a busy four lane road into two lanes, and the bike lanes to the West of High Park are almost entirely unused. In principal, I am not opposed to bike lanes, but this implementation of them, effectively reducing road space by 50%, for extremely sparsely used bike lanes, is an incredibly wasteful use of resources/space.\n2. The reports cited by the city, which state that average travel times along this stretch of road only increased by a de minimus amount, are not credible, and anyone who lives in this community who now experiences gridlock along Bloor on a regular basis can attest to this fact. Travel times, pollution, grid lock have increased materially, and as per my point 1 above, the bike lanes this was done for are rarely used.\n3. These bike lanes seem to be strongly opposed by the local community, but strongly supported by \"activists\" who *do not live in the community*.\n4. The implementation of the bike lanes have caused grid lock on bloor, and caused traffic to spill into local residential roads. Again, increasing pollution, noise, all to create space for *UNUSED BIKE LANES*.\nTo summarize, I am strongly opposed to the bike lanes. Please remove them. Thank you.\n"

I currently sit frustrated in a single lane of Bloor waiting at a green light for one car to turn right while the bike lanes remain completely empty.  In the winter I argue there are probably less than a dozen bikes riding along the path the entire day!\nHoping this bill passes as soon as possible for the relief of all those that live in these neighborhoods!\n"

        "comment": "Proposed Bill 212 focus on removing bike lanes and requiring municipalities to get provincial approval to install new bike lanes. This unequivocally, wastes tax payers money, increases red tape and bureaucracy, and will negatively affect public health and safety.\nAcross the province, municipalities are working to improve the quality of their communities. This has and will continue to involve the development of complete streets. A key aspect of which is improving safe and efficient travel for all forms of mobility. Dedicated and protected lanes for micro mobility users play an important role in this goal. By arbitrarily restricting and removing bike lanes, it will endanger vulnerable road users. This year in Toronto and across the province more broadly, over the past few years, we have seen increasing injuries and fatalities for all road users. Yet, to address this concerning trend, the proposed solutions are to restrict safe street design and to prioritize the most dangerous form of transportation. This will leave all other road users at a heightened risk of danger. As it is written, Bill 212 will actively contribute to endangering our streets.\nIn addition to making Ontarians less safe, this bill will force road users to get back into their cars, more cars means increased traffic congestion. The goal of reducing congestion should be to support all forms of transportation and ensure that all members of the community have safe and convenient mobility options. It should be up to an individual, not the government, if someone deems a car, transit, or micro mobility to be the best method of transportation for their situation. The government\u2019s role should be to ensure that each person\u2019s chosen form of transportation is safe, regardless of transportation method. Instead, proposed Bill 212 reaffirms that there is only care for the car and everyone else is a second class citizen.\nMoreover, the bill's provisions to override municipal by-laws and expedite infrastructure projects will undermine local governance and community input. This top-down approach will result in decisions that do not reflect the needs and preferences of local residents, further alienating communities from the decision-making process. A notable consequence of this bill will be the further erosion of environmental standards.\nIt is not \u201ccommon sense\u201d to put people and the planet at further risk. It is clear that proposed Bill 212 is a bill that is not supported by data-driven rationale. It is imperative for this bill and the government to have accurate and recent data to support their claims. To date, this is clearly not the case. As a consequence of this negligence, the government is increasing red tape and bureaucracy, eroding democratic best practices, and putting the lives of Ontarians at greater risk.\n"
