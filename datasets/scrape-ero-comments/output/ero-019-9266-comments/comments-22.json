        "comment": "To whom it may concern, I think anything that takes away from a city\u2019s right to decide its own infrastructure is a mistake. Specifically with bike lanes I also think it\u2019s a mistake to cede power that would let a provincial government decide what is best for a city that needs a variety of different transportation methods to address everything from climate change to traffic.\nThis seems to me like a low-effort way to change the topic from the spa at Ontario place.\nIt also seems like something that, yet again, is going to get challenged in court and reversed and cost tax payers more and more money.\nFigure it out Ford.\n"

        "comment": "How are we the only developed nation contemplating removing bike lanes citing no evidence that they benefit. They save lives. Those lives are constituents. We prioritize parking spaces more than we do travel lanes for cars or bikes. When will Ontario see what bigger and older cities already have. Large cities cannot accommodate single passenger vehicles as being the priority. Maybe if we didn\u2019t offload a highway onto a city with no plan to maintain it (gardiner) and finished transit projects on time (eglinton,finch,hurontario) there would be a lot less construction hampering commutes.\n"

        "comment": "I am currently a construction manager and licensed Ontario Professional Engineer. My education is in Civil Engineering with a focus on transportation and construction. I have worked on a multitude of provincial (MTO), regional (GTHA), and municipal roadway, bridge, and currently transit and rail projects, and from various sides of these contracts (Owner, constructor, and consultant) in the past decade.\nI find it extremely upsetting and frustrating that the Government of Ontario wants to pass Bill 212. Through my experiences, education, and unique perspective as an engineering professional involved with transportation, this bill ignores evidence-based data and common sense. Evidence-based data across Canada, and most of the world, gives credible evidence that the best way to keep society moving and growing is to provide efficient and safe transportation options for all members of society whether you are a cyclist, auto driver, or even transit rider. Instead of spending additional resources to remove bike lanes and reinstate car lanes, why not invest more money into incentivizing community members to explore other modes of transportation in order to reduce gridlock? Why not invest additional resources to accelerate the current construction of the other modes of transportation that would ease congestion? Why not look at the examples provided from other successful developed nations who have embraced progressive forms of transportation infrastructure and culture? Instead with Bill 212, we have to pause and take several steps back to undo progress, spend more taxpayer money in the process, and resort to methods that we know are all but short term solutions. Widening highways and roadways will only induce more demand and eventually worsen the traffic crisis we are currently experiencing in the GTHA.\n"

Why is a \u201csmall government\u201d party modelling in municipal politics? This is outrageous. Bike lanes make active transport safer, improving health outcomes, reducing the burden on healthcare systems, and over the medium and long term reduce congestion as the bike lanes network becomes more safe and comprehensive. Get back to work on health care, not municipal politics, Doug et al.\n"

Encouraging more cars to be on the road and creating more traffic only worsens the climate AND the health of the people of Ontario.\nThere are numerous studies from across the world that show the economic & health benefits of biking and bike lanes. We need more of them. We cannot afford it on any level to remove or discourage the construction of new bike infrastructure.\n"

        "comment": "There are so many things wrong with this bill. Cities across the world are investing in bike and transit infrastructure because research shows that the only way to reduce traffic congestion is less cars on the road. I don't need to rewrite all of the benefits because there is plenty of research publicly available, something the current government has chosen not to explore. Here are some:\n-Bike infrastructure is cheaper and more efficient than car infrastructure\n-It provides more transportation options, reducing reliance on cars\n-Bike infra results in increased safety for all people, drivers included\n-They are good for business\n-They improve individual health and the long-term health of society by promoting active lifestyles and reducing reliance on fossil fuels (Not to mention the healthcare burden from car accidents and pullution)\n-Removing bike lanes does not result in relieving congestion\n-When built in conjunction with liberal housing policies, we can build denser, healthier cities that are places to be lived in, not driven through\nThe provincial government hasn't provided any sort of data to back up their claims. Stopping cities from implementing more bike lanes and removing bike lanes will only result in more accidents, injuries and deaths. And it will not solve traffic congestion.\n"

        "comment": "Since moving back to Toronto from Hamilton in 2005, I have happily seen bicycle infrastructure grow from almost nothing, to the healthy and growing, network we now enjoy. As a cyclist who uses their bicycle to go to work, to do all my shopping and to attend events throughout the city, I would simply not be able to undertake all my day-to-day life without this infrastructure. It means I can get from home to destination in a relatively safe way, not having to compete with vehicles that are much larger and more dangerous than my own. I have seen a huge growth in numbers of others who navigate the city in the same way, and who use city bike rental services. The growth in numbers of cyclists has increased in direct proportion to the growth in infrastructure. I don't need to go over here a rebuttal of some of the arguments against bike lanes: emergency vehicle officials have repeatedly stated that they are not impacted negatively by bike lanes; businesses do not suffer, indeed, often see increased business. Hardly any mention is made of the effect of unregulated construction and parking lanes on traffic congestion. Or, the tardy delivery of important transit like the Eglinton line. This proposal is a slap in the face for citizens of Ontario who want to navigate their cities and towns via bicycle. It is an unmerited punishment for individuals who actually want to have a positive effect on congestion and the environment. Bikes take up much less space on roads; do not pollute; have health benefits for cyclists themselves (less drain on public health)...This proposal smacks of political opportunism and rank vote-buying. It is prejudicial in the truest sense and should not be voted in.\n"

Every municipality has unique traffic characteristics that are best known by that municipality.  Additionally, the province continues to create barriers to climate change reduction plans. Control on the addition of bike lanes only continues to favour the car culture that got us here.\n"

        "comment": "Hello!\nWe support bike lines.\nWe know from evidence that bike lanes help to:\n- reduce gridlock\n- reduce greenhouse gases\n- get people moving faster\nBike lanes are not just a matter of convenience; they are vital for many residents who rely on affordable transportation options. Delivery drivers, including those in food and courier services, as well as individuals who simply cannot afford vehicles due to the high cost of living, depend on both public transportation and bike lanes to move around the city. The rising cost of living has made car ownership unattainable for many, further highlighting the need for equitable, accessible alternatives like cycling infrastructure.\nWe must also recognize that traffic congestion is self-perpetuating. More cars on the road lead to more traffic. It\u2019s a cycle that anyone who takes a moment to reflect on the situation would easily understand. Expanding bike lanes offers an opportunity to break this cycle by encouraging more people to use alternative modes of transport, thereby reducing overall congestion and improving the flow of traffic for everyone.\nInvesting in safe, accessible bike infrastructure is essential for the health, safety, and well-being of our communities, as well as for addressing the city\u2019s pressing environmental and transportation challenges. These actions are not only distractions from the real needs of our city but also betray a lack of vision and leadership when it comes to addressing urban challenges. Bike lanes are a practical, immediate step that can provide tangible benefits for Toronto residents, but we need all levels of government working together, in good faith, to make them a reality.\nWe need a government that supports making decisions that are based in evidence.\nI feel quite embarrassed and sad for the policy designers who have to write bad policy, based on emotion, hatred and jealousy - all in order to distract the voters from the real problems (i.e. the province inability to actually get people moving by investing in regional transportation solutions, and not being able to actually get a project completed in time or in budget! yuck!).\n"

        "comment": "I live and work in downtown Toronto. I own a car, so am intimately familiar with the traffic issues. I also frequently use the bicycles provided by Toronto Bike Share as this often allows for a quicker trip to  parts of the city. I can say, unequivocally, as both a driver and a biker that there should be fewer - not more - bureaucratic barriers to building bike lanes in Toronto. When biking, I do my utmost to limit my travels to roads that have bike lanes. However, this is impossible if I chose to bike home from the downtown core, as at some point I must travel southbound on Jarvis St. towards the Gardiner. During rush hour, Jarvis is always jammed with agitated drivers waiting to get onto the Gardiner. When I pass by them on a bike, I frequently have to dodge cars either drifting towards the sidewalk or just plainly cutting me off. I am constantly scared that one of these interactions will go poorly, as a collision could have lifelong repercussions for my health. Surely, the benefit of decreasing a driver's commute time by a few minutes, by limiting the number of bike lanes, cannot be worth the trade-off of potentially life-altering injuries for a biker? Furthermore, if the Province truly wants to relieve congestion issues, it seems more sensible to provide travelers with other, faster alternatives to driving: would not any increase in lane capacity for cars quickly be absorbed by more people choosing to drive, instead of taking an alternative form of transit?\n"

Business patrons in Toronto are more likely to arrive on foot, transit or by bike.\nIf the province wants to reduce traffic, they should build more regional and local public transit infrastructure.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to this shortsighted idea that would grant the province the authority to stop municipalities from constructing essential bike lanes. This initiative not only undermines local decision-making but also poses a serious threat to the safety and well-being of our communities.\nThe claims that this bill aims to reduce traffic gridlock is misleading. In fact, studies have consistently shown that investing in bike lanes leads to reduced vehicle congestion, improved air quality, and enhanced public health. By restricting municipalities from expanding cycling infrastructure, the government is effectively promoting car dependency, increasing traffic congestion, and exacerbating pollution levels.\nFurthermore, requiring municipalities to seek provincial approval for bike lanes, especially when it involves the removal of vehicle lanes, is an unnecessary overreach of provincial power. Local governments are best positioned to assess the needs of their communities and make informed decisions regarding transportation infrastructure. This bill dismisses the voices of residents and undermines the progress made toward sustainable transportation.\nInstead of focusing on misguided legislation that hampers progress, the Ontario government should be prioritizing investments in sustainable transportation solutions that address the pressing issues of climate change and urban mobility.\nIn conclusion, I urge you to reconsider this dangerous and shortsighted bill. Our future depends on building a more inclusive, safe, and environmentally friendly transportation system, not one that rolls back the progress made in promoting cycling as a viable and essential mode of transport.\n"
