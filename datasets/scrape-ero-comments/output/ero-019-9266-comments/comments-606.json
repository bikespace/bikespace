        "comment": "Busy, highly developed cities the world over have extensive dedicated bike lanes alongside roads to manage traffic flows. As the population of Toronto, especially the city core, expands, many people rely on the bike lanes to safely get to and from work, out to events, and for deliveries. New buildings throughout the city do not have parking. The TTC is capacity constrained and there is no sign of when the Eglinton Crosstown will open. Removing bike lanes will not give people the funds or parking to turn to cars, and even if it did that would worsen congestion. Removing bike lanes will only increase accidents and injuries for cyclists while traumatizing drivers who hit cyclists. This is not the right solution to manage congestion or end gridlock.\n"

        "comment": "Background\nIt is remarkable the extent to which this government will go to keep all of us driving gas guzzling cars, despite the known impact of that policy on wildfires, heat waves, massive rainfall events and other environmental disasters. We need to do everything we can to reduce greenhouse gas emissions before it is too late. Instead, this Premier:\n1.\tEliminated the electric vehicle purchase subsidy\n2.\tRemoved the fee for a driver\u2019s licence as a \u201cgeneral\u201d measure to give inflation relief \u2013 encouraging more driving, and ignoring the people who can\u2019t afford cars, who are the most in need of inflation relief.\n3.\tProposed a ludicrous plan to build a tunnel under Highway 401 for $50-100 billion, which (even if it was successful in temporarily reducing traffic along that corridor) would dump a massive number of additional cars onto the streets of Toronto \u2013 increasing congestion and requiring ever more road building to avoid complete gridlock.\n4.\tWants to build Highway 413 and the Bradford Bypass, rather than improving transit or rail options. In the end they will not reduce congestion. They will, however, enrich the Premier\u2019s real estate development buddies, as they build sprawl north of Toronto rather than transit-oriented development in Toronto.\n5.\tAppears to have no knowledge of economics, specifically the concept of induced demand. The more you expand roads, the more people will use them rather than better options like public transit, cycling or walking. The roads will fill up again \u2013 but this time with even more cars and congestion.\n6.\tClaims he wants to reduce congestion. If he truly wanted to reduce congestion, he would not suggest that a few bike lanes are a major cause of that congestion. He  would look in the mirror, and start doing his job, rather than attempting to do the Toronto Mayor\u2019s job for her:\na.\tForce Metrolinx to say what is wrong with the Eglinton LRT, why it isn\u2019t operating already, and what the plan and timing is to open it. If they won\u2019t do that, fire the leader of Metrolinx, and perhaps some others.\nb.\tOpen the Finch LRT , and identify and fix the causes of perennial delays in Metrolinx construction timetables.\nc.\tComplete the Ontario Line ASAP.\nd.\tCancel the 413 and Bradford Bypass projects and put the money saved into new dedicated transit lines (subways or above ground in their own right of way) in Toronto and other cities across the province. This will ensure that transit speed is much more competitive with car travel (particularly when time to park is factored in).\ne.\tFix by far the biggest cause of congestion in downtown Toronto \u2013 the inability to access the Gardiner Expressway. This was always a problem, but became monumentally worse because of the changes led by John Tory to close the eastern (Lake Shore) entrance and maintain the full Expressway, for the benefit of the 15% who traverse the whole city, rather than tear a portion down, for the benefit of downtown liveability and the 85% who use the expressway to get downtown and back. We now have three downtown entrances instead of four \u2013 and it can now take 20 minutes to go one block towards the expressway on many days. The Province should work with the City to tear a section of the Expressway down and rebuild with much better access roads/ramps to enter the elevated Expressway from the downtown area to the east (at Jarvis?) and to the west (at York?). Maybe that section could use a short tunnel to allow traffic to flow freely to both the Expressway and to Lake Shore in the very limited space available.\nf.\tIn addition, the Waterfront LRTs (both east and west) should be funded to relieve pressure on the Expressway itself. The Lakeshore Go line improvements (electrification and at least 15 minute service) should be fast-tracked \u2013 they too are needed to relieve pressure on the Expressway.\ng.\tWork with cities across the Province to provide reliable funding for frequent public transit service and new public transit lines/facilities, especially where those new facilities will relieve pressure to expand roads.\nh.\tRather than paying to force cities to take bike lanes out, give them specific funding required to put bike lanes in without reducing the current car travel lanes, if those lanes are truly needed based on current traffic levels. Specifically on Bloor Street west of Runnymede, give Toronto the money to buy the land necessary to expand the car lanes at the South Kingsway/Jane Street and Royal York intersections while keeping the bike lanes. With those two areas fixed, the overall traffic movement on Bloor Street west of Runnymede would be in the acceptable range. This would be a City/Province co-operative step forward to a sustainable future, rather than a unilateral forced step back to a car-dependent past.\nSpecific Comments on Bill 212\nHighway 413\nAs noted above, Highway 413 is a huge mistake. It is a corrupt gift from the Premier to his developer buddies, at the cost of the environment. There will be no long term benefit (once induced demand clogs the highways again), except for the developers, who will get a windfall likely far higher than the $8 billion identified by the corrupt process in attempting to open the Greenbelt land. The Highway, of course, would destroy Greenbelt land and traverse many sensitive watersheds. This bill guts any need for environmental review that might actually stop the highway, and sets up onerous fines and roadblocks for anyone who might want to oppose or slow down building the highway. This is an unacceptable assault on our democratic right to oppose a government action which is fundamentally unsound. We are going to see quite enough of that south of the border \u2013 there is no place for that in Canada.\nHighway Traffic Act / Bike Lane Law\nOnce again, this legislation is an assault on local democracy \u2013 the obvious idea that local issues are better dealt with locally. The citizens of Toronto elected Toronto City Council to deal with bike lanes and other local road issues \u2013 not Doug Ford. In fact, the citizens of Toronto directly rejected Doug Ford when he ran for mayor. If he wants to be mayor, he should resign and run for mayor in the next election. Otherwise, he should let Toronto City Council decide what is best for Toronto \u2013 and take the consequences at the next election if their constituents don\u2019t like what they are doing.\nThe premier obviously wants a fight with Toronto City Council, in order to (he thinks) improve his electoral chances in the election he will call soon. Even if one thinks that is an acceptable thing for him to do, he does not have to drag other cities with very different situations into that fight. The legislation only applies to \u201cprescribed municipalities\u201d. If it is implemented, the number of prescribed municipalities should be very few \u2013 perhaps just Toronto. Many cities in the province have multiple roads that are overbuilt, thanks to overzealous traffic planners. Those roads could easily have car lanes removed without major traffic impact \u2013 cities should not be impeded from doing that.\nI agree that cities should do what they can to avoid major traffic problems when they add bike lanes to major roads. Ideally, no intersections should be at level of service (LOS) F, and preferably not LOS E either. Toronto\u2019s data after the latest signal optimization on Bloor Street still shows Royal York Road and the South Kingsway intersections with LOS F status. The city needs to improve those two intersections. To the extent that the threatened legislation puts pressure on the city to do that, it does have some value.\nAt the same time, though, there is no option other than Bloor Street to cross the Humber River in that area. Having a safe route to cross the Humber River is critical for bicycles, just as it is for cars. If the Province forces the removal of the bike lanes, they have destroyed a vital link in the city wide cycling network that we must build \u2013 for equity for those who can\u2019t afford a car, for vulnerable road user safety, but also for greenhouse gas reductions and congestion relief.  I should note that the bridge itself is not the issue, which is normal. Like many roads, the capacity of Bloor Street is determined by how many lanes there are at intersections that have many cars turning. In between the intersections (on the bridge, for example), one lane in each direction is perfectly adequate.\nSome say they are fine with bike lanes, as long as they go on \u201cless busy parallel routes\u201d to the main arterial roads . I challenge anyone who says that to draw the route they would build along the \u201cless busy parallel routes\u201d along the length of Bloor Street (particularly from Jane Street to Kipling, but not just there). Then ask them to drive that route in a car (which can detour with much less effort than a cyclist would need) , and see how happy they are.\nSo we need to find a way to accommodate both cars and cyclists on Bloor Street. As noted above, I believe the answer is to rebuild Bloor Street  at the Royal York and South Kingsway/Jane intersections by purchasing land to add back car lanes while retaining the bike lanes. This will not be cheap. If the Province really wants to reduce congestion, they can help fund that cost \u2013 which will restore Bloor\u2019s car carrying capacity and add new capacity for travel by bike \u2013 a win/win. The cost may not be much more than they have already agreed to pay to rip the bike lanes out.\nI suspect from my brief look at the Yonge Street bike lanes, there may be similar issues there, that may require land purchases as well. As for University Avenue, I have done multiple walks along the route in rush hour. The street was actually rebuilt with the full planning approach, and it shows it . The traffic generally moves smoothly south of Bloor. Where there are issues, it is not caused by the bike lanes. Construction and too many pedestrians to allow right turns were issues in spots, but not the bike lanes. South of King or Wellington Street, southbound traffic did get bad \u2013 driven by the back-up trying to get on the Gardiner, nothing to do with bike lanes. Northbound, there was a substantial slowdown at Adelaide because of cars not clearing the box,  and so cars couldn\u2019t get through the intersection \u2013 again, nothing to do with bikes. I see no reason to remove the University lanes south of Bloor. The Premier doesn\u2019t know what he is talking about if he thinks bike lanes are a major cause of congestion there.\nIf the Province does go through with this legislation, it should do three things:\n1.\tMinimize the number of prescribed municipalities (perhaps Toronto only).\n2.\tDevelop criteria for approval or denial of municipal requests that is consistent with the Complete Streets philosophy. That says that some reduction in car traffic capacity is an acceptable compromise if it allows space for better active transportation options. Limit denials or requests for improvement to plans that expect poor levels of service post implementation (or currently, if you are reviewing an existing cycling facility). \u201cPoor\u201d is defined as LOS F, or perhaps LOS E or F.\n3.\tCommit to transparent reporting every 6 months \u2013 how many requests received for review, how many reviews finalized, what percentage of finalized reviews were approved/denied/changes requested, average time to make the decision, reviews currently outstanding. It would also be helpful to have a public searchable database of project reviews, so citizens can see the exact damage the Premier has done with this legislation. The reporting should also include a count of cyclists and pedestrian deaths or serious injuries in the province, so we continue to see the human cost of the premier\u2019s misguided \u201ccar first\u201d policies.\n"

My wife was hit by a car while riding her bicycle and is still off work. I have had more close calls than I care to remember. We need to make riding a bicycle in the city of Toronto a normal behaviour that drivers respect. This does not happen spontaneously. Clearly separated bicycle lanes are one way we can improve safety. We seem to have forgotten that the city is for people, and people get around in many different ways. If traffic is bad, it isn\u2019t the fault of cyclists who take up a small sliver of a small percentage of our roadways: if I\u2019m on my bicycle, I\u2019m not in the car in front of you. We need a connected system of safe bicycle lanes that Torontonians will actually use, and they will only use it if it is safe. We need enforcement of traffic laws - for cars and cyclists - so that both acknowledge that safety is a communal effort. Taking out bike lanes will just put me back in my car, possibly in front of you. Remember when you are in your car: you aren\u2019t stuck IN traffic: you ARE the traffic.

If their design is bad, locals will complain, and it's up to the municipality to fix that, not the province. While that may be subjective opinion, here's some objective data-based proven facts:\nDue to induced demand, any roads with removed bike lanes will see even more traffic and gridlock within a few months, not less. Studies have found that \"each 1 percent [increase] in capacity results in a nearly 2 percent increase in travel\". Removing lanes to add bike lanes gets more people onto bikes and public transit, which reduces congestion for the remaining drivers. Suburban drivers benefit from bike lanes as much as city-core cyclists do.\nThis bill is a shortsighted attempt to fix congestion which will actually make it worse during construction, better for around 1 to 3 months after the lane opens, and then worse than it is now after 3 months when twice as many people start trying to drive in that new lane. And all this at a massive cost to taxpayers.\n"

        "comment": "ERO 019-9265      Response to Bill 212: Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act\nI do not support the above legislation for the following reasons: it does not respect local democracy and municipal planning decisions; it will make it much more difficult or even impossible for Toronto to meet its climate emissions goals, specifically the city\u2019s target to become carbon neutral by 2040; and the 48 million dollar price tag will put more cyclists in danger without achieving the professed goal of reducing traffic congestion.\n1. Lack of Respect for Local Democracy\nThe City of Toronto (and other Ontario municipalities) is better able to make planning decisions based on local needs and local priorities than the provincial government. In the document \u201cImpact of Bill 212: Bike Lanes Framework\u201d, the Toronto city manager summarizes the impact of this legislation in a detailed, meticulously researched report. Among its conclusions, it states that \u201cthe absence of bikeways has a disproportionately negative impact on low-income communities and Indigenous, Black and other communities of colour.\u201d It notes that Toronto is the busiest city in North America due to construction and that \u201cthe reduced network capacity due to construction-related road closures is a primary factor contributing to congestion across the city.\u201d\nMunicipalities, like Toronto, know what their residents need and have local knowledge about the challenges they face, including gridlock. In fact, it is their responsibility as locally elected municipal governments to make these decisions.\n2. Climate Goals\nTo achieve Toronto city council\u2019s goal to become carbon neutral by 2040, it will have to reduce emissions from passenger vehicles which account for almost a quarter of its GHG emissions. The city has increased funding and capacity to expand and improve its cycling network, \u201cspending $30 million on bikeways in 2023, the most it has ever invested in a single year\u201d (Toronto Star, \u2018A truly poisonous intervention\u2019, September 26, 2024). In the same article, authors Kate Allen and Mahdis Habibinia state, \u201cstaff reports have consistently found that adding and improving [bike] lanes results in vastly more cyclists on these roads. At Adelaide and Richmond Streets at Spadina Avenue, for example, cyclist counts jumped from 562 in 2013 to 3,763 in 2022, an increase of 570 per cent, and the number of people using the city\u2019s Bike Share system spiked from about 665,000 trips in 2015 to more than 4.5 million in 2022.\u201d\nThe Transportation Tomorrow Survey, done in partnership with the province and Golden Horseshoe municipalities to support planning for transportation infrastructure, shows that in 2022, 5.8% of city commuters took bikes or other forms of \u201cmicromobility\u201d to work. The number of daily cycling trips has more than tripled in two decades (55,000 in 2001 to 172,000+ in 2022). These numbers are just part of the picture, but it is clear that people are choosing to use bikes, scooters, etc. to get around. That means fewer cars on the road, and more people able to get to where they\u2019re going without getting into a car.\nEven so, Toronto has a long way to go to meet its climate targets and needs to take many more gas-powered cars off the road. Patricia Wood, a professor in York University\u2019s Faculty of Environmental and Urban Change, sums it up: \u201cSo to have the province even float the idea of reducing the possibility to create space for active transportation by prioritizing private automobiles over bike lanes is a truly poisonous intervention \u2026 even debating this only drags us backwards and wastes our time.\u201d\n3. Bike Lanes Save Lives\nAccording to a Toronto Star editorial (September 25, 2024), research from around the world has shown that bike lanes separated from cars improve the safety of cyclists, pedestrians and motorists: \u201cAn American study published last November in the Journal of Transport and Health \u2026 found that protected bike lanes make roads significantly safer for cyclists and other users. Cities with dedicated bike lanes had 44 per cent fewer deaths and 50 per cent fewer serious accidents than other American cities\u201d.  The city manager\u2019s Bike Impact report reveals that, \u201cresearch and experience from across North America and around the world have shown that a connected and safe cycling network is a key part of mitigating congestion in a growing city, while improving safety and mobility\u2026.Independent peer-reviewed research has shown that the introduction of separated bikeways reduces the risk of cycling injury (about 9 times lower than a major street with parked cars and no cycling infrastructure). It also increases the feeling of comfort and safety for all road users.\nMy husband and I cycled in Germany in 2019 and can attest to that feeling of comfort and safety when we were able to cycle for long distances in separated bike lanes. They were an accepted part of the transportation infrastructure.\n4. Blaming Bike Lanes for Congestion is Not Supported by Research\nBoth the Toronto Star editorial and the city manager\u2019s report reiterate that \u201cit isn\u2019t cyclists and bike lanes that are the main culprits in creating gridlock. It is construction, road closures and traffic returning to pre-pandemic levels\u2026. [I]n Paris, London and other metropolises, these lanes have often had the opposite effect [to gridlock], leading to more cyclists and fewer cars on the road.\u201d Even \u201csmall reductions in the number of vehicles on the road can produce large improvements in traffic flow\u201d.\n5. $48 Million Dollars\nTaxpayers will be on the hook for $48 million dollars (plus other costs the city of Toronto and other municipalities will face) to tear out bike lanes that will make the roads more dangerous, and won\u2019t solve the problem of gridlock. This is a very expensive, ill-considered gambit.\nI would suggest a better name for this bill would be \u201cFailing to Reduce Gridlock, Endangering Lives For No Good Reason Act\u201d.\n"

Driving is also a fun hobby for me on the weekend with my classic car. But I am also a cyclist.\nI am biking more and more with the new bike lanes in Toronto. I spend more locally in Toronto with the lanes, as a stressful drive can often be replaced by a leisurely bike ride. I am even making plans to winter-bike to get more out of the infrastructure and get more exercise. The new bike lanes are new: they take time to draw riders to use them--especially in a historically car-centric city like Toronto. We have never been a safe city to bike in, so many people have avoided it. More people need to bike and use public transportation, if this city is to free up transportation infrastructure. We need to encourage people to do this and give time for the new biking infrastructure to change habits. If the Premier himself needs to get to work faster, I would rather he use a police motorcade or helicopter than rip out and destroy this city's infrastructure progress and future success.\nSpeaking now as a driver in Toronto, more car lanes will not reduce gridlock. Too many driving laws are not enforced and the induced demand of more car lanes will incentivize more poor driving behaviour (illegal parking, speeding, following too closely, illegal turns, distracted driving, road rage, etc.). If the province want to reduce gridlock and save time, it must find a way to enforce existing laws and curteous driving habits. It must also find a way to get people OUT of cars and into other forms of transportation.\nThank you for your time.\n"
