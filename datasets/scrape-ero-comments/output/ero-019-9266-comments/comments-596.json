        "comment": "I strongly oppose Bill 212. I don\u2019t own a car, and biking is one of the most affordable and sustainable ways I get around Toronto. Removing bike lanes or restricting their development isn\u2019t just anti-poor\u2014it\u2019s a shortsighted waste of taxpayers\u2019 money. Millions have already been invested in building these lanes, and tearing them out undermines the city\u2019s progress toward safe, eco-friendly, and cost-effective transportation.\nFor people like me, cycling is more than a lifestyle choice; it\u2019s a necessity to save money and reduce dependence on expensive transit options. This bill prioritizes drivers at the expense of those who can\u2019t afford cars and ignores the benefits bike lanes bring to traffic flow and urban living. Dismantling infrastructure that\u2019s already proving its value isn\u2019t just inequitable; it\u2019s fiscally irresponsible.\nInstead of wasting resources to appease a car-centric agenda, we should focus on expanding cycling infrastructure that benefits everyone, from improved safety to reduced congestion and environmental impact. This bill is a step in the wrong direction and undermines the needs of a growing, diverse city.\n"

        "comment": "There are so many benefits to being able to cycle around the City of Toronto Safely.  It is good for a person's health.  It is good for the environment.  It is generally faster than the TTC or going by car.  I have just read through the City's response to Bill 212.  It is clear that more and more people are choosing to get on their bikes.  Since bike lanes have been put in, ridership along these bike lanes has increased, often by more than 100%.  As the climate continues to heat up (largely due to the use of fossil fuels- cars) more people need to have to option of safe alternative to the car.  The city's response to Bill 212 also points out that traffic accidents that injure cyclists have dropped dramatically.  One of the main points of the report is that congestion in this city is being caused largely by private construction projects. NOT by public bike lanes that are free for everybody to use.  Taking out the bike lanes will make the streets of Toronto less safe for cyclists and pedestrians.  It will cost a ridiculous amount of money and it will make congestion even worse.  If you create more safe bike lanes for people, more people will get on their bikes.  If you make more space for cars, more people will get in their cars causing even more congestion, and more pollution and more climate change.  This is a municipal area, the province has no business and should have no say.\n"

It is so backwards that we have used science and consultation with the community to determine that these bike lanes are the best suit for that individual community and to just pull them out with a whim and the premieres personal hatred of bicycles is disgusting and authoritarian.\n"

        "comment": "It is disappointing as a cyclist living in downtown Toronto to read that you'd want to destroy an important means of transportation and safety for cyclists in the downtown core. I was feeling so good about the new bike lanes. Just recently I was riding through the business district and pleased that I could contribute to reducing green house gas emissions and grid-lock by cycling to and from my various appointments. Not only that, I was not paying huge parking fees at the downtown lots.\nAs a taxpayer, I oppose the complete waste of money in tearing up these three vital routes, at a cost of 20 million, not to mention the 40 million it took to create them. I challenge the Ministry to protect the bike lanes, an initiative that serves at least 10% of the community public who must travel downtown routes to and from work and other activities. Further, I understand that a census study from 2011 was used to indicate a low bike-ridership in the city, which is outdated and includes areas outside the downtown core. Living and working in the 2nd highest density neighbourhood in Toronto and the fourth in the Country, this short-sighted decision, need to be overturned.\nIn closing I know the City of Toronto is seeking the advice of their solicitor about legal action. More tax money going out the window. JUST KEEP THE BIKE LANES WHERE THEY ARE. What is creating gridlock from my observation of the Trinity Spadina Riding is the closing of lanes for the construction of market condos, to which 10,000 are unoccupied. Investigate that and please help protect us bike-riders who are doing what we can to protect our environment, which is under attack by cars emitting greenhouse gases.\n"

Why would any taxpayer want their money to be spent on undoing the efforts of another level of government?  If there are fewer safe options to commute through the city, it will just create more car congestion.  For those who are committed to cycling to commute, you are endangering their lives.\n"

        "comment": "Wasting millions of dollars to rip out bike lanes and forcing everyone to endure months of construction yet again is astounding. Adding more car lanes may ease gridlock for a short while, until more people start driving, then you're right back where you started. And you'll have made the roads less safe for everyone, drivers included.\nSpend the money on better transit. The TTC subway is constantly plagued by \"mechanical\" or \"operational\" issues, not to mention the numerous slow speed zones because the tracks are in bad shape.\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nI am writing to share my disapproval of Bill 212. I cycle 5 days a week for work, and additional days as my primary method of commuting in the city of Toronto. The bike lanes have allowed me to travel more safely and efficiently. Without the bike lanes, I would either ride my bike on the road with other drivers, which is more dangerous and slows traffic, or I would drive which adds additional traffic.\nThe city and province should also be considering the environmental impact of cars, and reduced carbon emissions from from cycling over driving.\nI believe Bill 212 will not improve gridlock, and elevates drivers over those taking public transit, cyclists, and pedestrians. We all require safe, reliable, and efficient infrastructure to get where we are going. All large cities, like Toronto, rely on public transit to move the most amount of people. Investing in public transit would help traffic more than removing bike lanes. Bike lanes are not the enemy, but an ally.\n"

        "comment": "I have worked and lived in downtown Toronto for the past several decades since my architectural studies at TMU and UofT. Weather permitted, I like to take my bike to do errands in downtown core. Everybody knows that most of the Toronto city roads are narrow bumpy and quite treacherous when one is not riding on bike paths. Often the motorists like to bypass the cyclists in aggressive manner showing their discontent towards the cyclists and I almost hit the curbs or ditches while trying to keep to the right side of the road hanging on to my dear life. Whenever I encounter a few and rare bike lanes in the city, I immediately feel safe again. I visited the Netherlands in 2019 and envy their wonderful bike culture and infrastructure. Their masterful integration of bike and public transportation system into their very liveable  urban planning should be emulated and modelled after. How did the Dutch do it? They are a cold climate country as well. Please do the right thing. Bike paths save lives and make Toronto a more liveable and pedestrian friendly city. Let\u2019s not follow the American city model especially LA where cars dictate their city urban planning with even no sidewalks at all.\n"

Cycling is one of the most efficient modes of transportations from an energy and space perspective and should be favoured over car infrastructure.\nAlso these decisions should be left up to municipalities to decide what best suits their demographic needs. The province has no business telling cities how to develop their streets when it comes to active transportation like bike lanes and other assets.\nSincerely,\nRobert\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are the scapegoat of cowards. There's no evidence to suggest that bike lanes cause congestion. In fact, there's evidence that they help REDUCE it, as they allow people to feel safe enough to commute in a more space-efficient way than private vehicle. The less safe you make the streets, the more people will commute by private car.\nAnd getting rid of bike lanes won't get rid of bikers. You'll always have people riding bikes. This way, they'll just be less safe, more in the way of cars, and more unpredictable for drivers.\n"

Mr. Ford you should be ashamed for believing that bike lanes are a waste of tax dollars and should be removed from our city streets, I think anyone who believes that it is better to remove Bike Lanes to improve car traffic is  Ludacris And have never lost a family member to a motor vehicle. The pain a family goes through by far more severe than the extra time it takes for you to get home along streets with Bike Lanes.  Take a page from the book in Amsterdam, where they are cutting car lanes constantly and it works. It is safer think how much better our health would be if we all took A closer look at how they are managing we should be ashamed that we prefer faster home times than peoples lives.\n"

        "comment": "Weather conditions permitting I bike everyday to shop , go to work, medical appointments etc. I can't help noticing that the main cause of traffic congestion is the huge amount of lane closures for condo and other construction. For example Eglinton East of Yonge is again down to lane closures because new side walks are being poured as part of the LRT work now in its 14 th year! This sounds like poor planning and incompetence by a provincial agency.\nIt so easy just to blame bike lanes without looking at the real situation. Why are people driving down town when we have multi billion dollar transit systems. How about getting the above mentioned LRT completed. As I said earlier now 14 years and still no date for in service.\nThere is no \"saving you time\" when the traffic will reach the same level of congestion if additional lanes are opened up. Have you noticed any bike lanes on the 401?\n"

I rode through and around the city for years, until the pleasure of riding a bike was overwhelmed by fear of grievous bodily harm. Driving my car to see family and attend doctor's appointments had become the norm. Meanwhile, traffic thickened  and angry drivers looked for someone to blame.\nImagine my pleasure then to try riding a bicycle again and discovering the wonderful network of bike lanes quietly created all through the centre of town. I quickly bicycled past construction sites all around the city - you don't have to be a traffic engineer to figure out what's causing the traffic jams. It's construction, gridlock, illegal parking, and bad tempers, not cyclists in their bike lanes!\nOur new bike lanes are a godsend, please don't let Ford et all take them away, just as occasional cyclists (like me) are discovering them. They truly are a jewel in the crown of our local traffic system. I agree with the vision and plans of our city council and staff to make the city safer and faster for all  means of transportation including our wonderful  bike lanes. Please draw a line in the sand.\njs\n"

The solution lies in the fostering the important mind shift from personal transportation to public transportation, to walking, and to riding a bicycle through the core of the City.\nEquality absurd is DoFo\u2019s plan to build a 6-lane gopher hole under the Gardener Expressway. Apart from wasting billions and billions of taxpayers dollars, that plan will simply push the gridlock further out to the edge of the city where the current infrastructure could not handle additional traffic. Once again, DoFo has no shred of evidence that this will help provide a long-term solution.\nIt is time to dump Bill 212.\n"
