In 2023, Torontonians elected a Mayor who explicitly supports the installation of municipal bike lanes. Bill 212 would undermine the Mayor\u2019s authority and effectively disenfranchise millions of voters in Toronto.\n"

        "comment": "Hi there,\nI live in downtown Toronto and own both a car and a bike and use both often, and I am very opposed to this proposal. Tearing up existing bike lanes, that were just recently finished no less, will not help traffic congestion. These streets were congested before the bike lanes went in, and they'll stay congested if the bike lanes get ripped up again. Doug Ford is bending to all the suburban drivers complaining about some imagined war on cars and thinking that bikes are somehow part of the problem instead of being part of the solution. The only things that will actually help congestion downtown are more bikers, more commuters and less drivers, and the only way to achieve that is to make public transit more affordable and reliable, and to increase bike lanes. This is a short sighted and backwards move and I'm firmly opposed to it.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212, specifically the Framework for bike lanes that require removal of a traffic lane, is undemocratic and wasteful. Doug Ford's conservatives were not elected to make decisions about municipal matters like Toronto bike lanes (in fact, only 12% of Ontarians in Toronto Centre voted for that party to govern over provincial matters). This bill is a gross overstep and negates the research and work that has been done at a municipal level by politicians and bureaucrats with the mandate to do that work. This effort to undo municipal projects is also an irresponsible waste of taxpayer dollars, which are desperately needed to address important issues under provincial jurisdiction like healthcare (e.g. doctor shortage), education (e.g., large class sizes), and labour (e.g., skills shortages).\n"

        "comment": "I am a cyclist. Like many people living in Toronto, I do not have a car. I cannot afford a car but I prefer to get around the city by bike, or TTC when biking isn't practical. I find it the quickest, healthiest, least expensive and less polluting way to get around. I realize I am risking my life by riding my bike. And I know many people who won't ride a bike because they don't feel safe. One of the greatest problems we face right now is the climate crisis that we are now entering, and is becoming increasingly obvious by the many extreme weather events that are damaging so many cities and regions - Jasper, North Carolina, Valencia, etc - it is a priority to do everything we can to try to slow this. This will also happen to Toronto, as it already has to some degree this past suffer, with floods. We need to create more infrastructure to encourage people to stop using carbon emitting cars and to use other modes of transportation. There have been so many cyclists injured or killed in Toronto - cyclists who are doing the right thing by riding their bikes, must be protected! It is the only reasonable response to this problem, as well as the problem of gridlock. We need better bike lanes and a better public transit system. Any government that does not move in that direction, but encourages more car use is completely irresponsible and does not care for citizens in its jurisdiction.  We need more, not fewer bike lanes!\n"

        "comment": "This proposed bill will bring about the opposite of its title. Removing bike lanes will not reduce gridlock, nor save anyone time. City of Toronto data shows that the 2011 removal of bike lanes on Jarvis Street did not lead to traffic improvement. Every community, and large urban centres foremost, should have increased mobility and transportation options, not less.\nThe Ontario Traffic Council and the Ontario Professional Planners Institute are opposed to this legislative change that is not evidence-based and runs counter to provincial planning policies. Both organizations also raise concerns about public safety. No Ontario resident can in good conscience support a bill that should more accurately be named the \"Increasing Gridlock, Wasting Everyone's Time and Tax Dollars Act.\"\n"

        "comment": "I am a driver, cyclist, and urban/transportation planner and I strongly oppose this proposal.\nWhat is clear is that the Ontario government has not looked at any of the evidence on transportation demand management, or any understanding of the concept of induced demand. Adding additional travel lanes (or retaining existing ones) will not improve congestion.\nThere is overwhelming evidence from cities the world over that demonstrate that cycling lanes reduce traffic, support local businesses, and improve safety outcomes.\nIt\u2019s challenging to comprehend the rationale for the proposed legislation to create a new provincial approval process for bike lanes in municipalities, among other policy directions in the transport, land use planning, and environmental space.\nThis legislation runs counter to evidence from cities the world over that are providing safe travel options and streets for everyone. This is a step backward and must be reconsidered. Ontario can and must do better.\nFurthermore, the removal of existing bike lanes, on Toronto or elsewhere, is completely ridiculous. This is not a decision that the province should be making on behalf of cities, which have a better understanding of the interests of local communities and road users. This includes businesses within Toronto, which overwhelmingly have benefited from the bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "As a resident of Toronto, I do not support Bill 212.\nFirst, it has been proven that bike lanes actually reduce gridlock and traffic in cities. As cited by CBC in their recent article, \"Do bike lanes really cause more traffic congestion? Here's what science says,\"\na European study demonstrated that more lanes for vehicle traffic actually induces further traffic and congestion while the installation of bike lanes drastically increases the number of individuals biking because bikers feel safer. Even if the traffic is increased somewhat, an Australian study found that in areas where traffic was increased it tended to be less than 10s/km, which in Toronto would be less than 7 minutes across the widest part of the city and only if bike lanes were actually slowing traffic along the whole route.\nAs someone who enjoys biking, but is not fully comfortable on a bike, I would never ride a bike on a street where there isn't a bike lane. Ripping out existing bike lanes will have a horrendous impact on traffic and the exhaust will further contribute to the impacts of climate change.\nSecond, it is NOT the role of the Province to dictate the design of streets in municipalities. Toronto's infrastructure design should be left up to the City to determine in consultation with its residents.\nAs someone who grew up in midtown Toronto and currently lives immediately off of Yonge Street and near Bloor Street, I have seen first hand the positive impact of bike lines. More people than ever are choosing to bike to work with the use of the bike share network skyrocketing. The bike lanes are so important for the safety of pedestrians, who used to have to contend with bikes illegally on the sidewalks, and for the safety of the bikers.\nThe Province should instead focus on completing its existing transit projects like the Eglinton LRT and the Ontario Line, which would actually help to ease traffic rather than creating legislation for the sole purpose of winning votes.\nFinally, the statistics cited by Minister Sarkaria are misleading, as tens of thousands of Torontonians take bike trips each and every day (Toronto Bike Share alone had 5.7 million trips last year) and the statement that we have lost 50 percent does not mean we have had a 50 percent increase in traffic. Traffic issues in Toronto are due almost entirely to public transit not keeping pace with the growth in residents and due to endless construction constantly blocking lanes or closing roads. A well planned street with bike lanes and left turn lanes would allow for adequate traffic flow.\nPlease leave the decisions about our road and sidewalk infrastructure to the City. If the Province is intervening no matter what, please look at making them one-way on parallel streets rather than ripping them out all together (and creating even more construction and traffic). Anything you do will be a horrible waste of tax payer money.\n"

        "comment": "This is a travesty made my people more concerned with stirring up culture wars for votes than the safety and happiness of people who live in the city -- notably most people calling for this DO NOT EVEN LIVE IN TORONTO, especially the downtown core! I do, and I am sick and tired of people who spend most of the year on the outskirts of the GTA at best thinking they can dictate what happens in OUR city.\nBike lanes are PROVEN to have a beneficial effect -- anyone saying otherwise hasn't read the studies. If you have functioning eyes this is also something you can tell by walking down the street and seeing all the bikes pass by the cars stalled in traffic. Bikes and bike lanes do not cause congestion -- CARS DO! I love driving. I have nothing against driving. I prefer not to do it in the city because there are other ways to get around, like walking, transit, and yes, bikes, that are more efficient with my time and let me appreciate the beauty of the city more. But that doesn't mean I never drive in the city or that I have an agenda against driving in the city. Often, it will be necessary. And from the perspective of a driver, the biggest annoyance is NOT cyclists, but ON STREET PARKING! That causes infinitely more annoyance and congestion and awkward lane swapping than any cyclist ever could. So why isn't the corrupt Ford government attacking that? Curious! Almost as if this is a disingenuous, politically motivated attack instead of something meant to actually improve our city!\nKeep these bike lines. Keep people moving and safe. Stop attacking cyclists for political votes. I have had friends (cyclists and pedestrians) injured by cars who aren't obeying the rules of the road and you will never convince me that strong, defended bike lanes aren't needed. More bike lanes, more bike lanes on major routes, and less letting outsiders dictate how OUR city is run!\nAnd you know if the bike lanes go, cyclists will just drive in the main lanes, as they are allowed to do. How's THAT going to improve traffic? Ridiculous.\n"

This shortsighted legislation not only jeopardizes cyclist safety in high-traffic areas but completely ignores the daily challenges we face navigating our city. With TTC delays mounting and road congestion worsening, cycling has become a vital transportation solution for countless Torontonians. The bill's provisions, which appear to prioritize certain private interests over public safety, represent a dangerous step backward in our city's development. Even more troubling is the unprecedented power granted to the Premier to bypass established legal frameworks.

I see nothing but economic, environmental, and public health and safety regression as a result of this change, as well as increased congestion as cyclists are forced to take the lane. Removing these bike lanes is staunchly opposed by businesses and cyclists for a reason. As other major cities like Paris take steps to reduce the number of cars moving through their urban cores, it is shameful that we would be forced, in what is undeniably provincial overreach, to move the other way.\n"

        "comment": "I disagree with Bill 212 in its entirety for several reasons. Firstly, provincial approval for municipal decisions regarding transportation planning is a gross overstep of government. The provincial government should have absolutely no say in the municipal planning of cities.\nSecondly, the removal of bike lanes has several environmental, safety, and equity-based impacts. From an environmental standpoint, the removal of bike corridors eliminates an easy route for active transportation and could easily encourage more people who currently bike to take cars. This would not improve congestion in any manner and could increase emissions. Increasing infrastructure for vehicles is unsustainable, expensive, non-resilient urban design, particularly in the GTA which has recently experienced high population growth.\nThis bill clearly disregards the safety of cyclists as well. Protected bike lanes are incredible infrastructure for both cyclists and drivers because they separate the two groups on the road, resulting in fewer interactions where an accident could occur. Cyclists bear the burden of injuries from these interactions in every case, and this bill is promoting harm to this vulnerable group.\nFrom this standpoint, it is clear that this bill has an equity-based impact as removing these lanes will disproportionately affect those who cannot afford cars, further widening transportation equity gaps.\n"
