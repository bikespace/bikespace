        "comment": "I strongly disagree with this policy. Research shows that bike lanes calm traffic, making roads safer for drivers, pedestrians, and cyclists alike. Additionally, having more people on bikes means fewer people on the roads in cars, reducing the biggest contributor to traffic.\nFinally, businesses in the area (through a BIA https://www.torontotoday.ca/local/politics-government/bia-warns-removal\u2026 ) have commented on the importance of bike lanes to the local community.\nAdditionally, many food delivery services are provided via people on bikes. Having this group transition to cars would only increase traffics in surrounding business areas\n"

I love the bike lanes and would rather not get run over <3\nDoug Ford is using people's saftey to try and win a few points in the polls from suburban voters who rarley even interact with roads that have bike lanes. Bike lanes save live, reduce congestion, and reduce the amount of drivers suffering with the mental toll of running over a cyclist.\n"

Road safety ought to take precedence over everything else. As few people as possible should die on public roads, and bike lanes achieve that.\n3. It is inefficient and costly. Cyclists who decide that the roads are unsafe and unwieldy will end up on transit. This will end up costing the public purse.\n"

        "comment": "This is clearly a betrayal of Ontario's commitment to reduces greenhouse gases. Multi-modal transportation is a key strategy for reducing emissions from transportation. Currently, transportation is the largest category of emissions in Ontario:\nhttps://www.cer-rec.gc.ca/en/data-analysis/energy-markets/provincial-te\u2026\nFurther, a City of Toronto survey shows that people are feel twice as comfortable on streets with on-street bike lanes or cycle tracks:\nhttps://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/8f76-2019-Cycling-Pub\u2026\nTherefore, removing these bicycle lanes will make it more difficult to access car-alternate transport modalities - which are essential for reducing emissions. Removal of these lanes are clearly an abdication of any attempts to reduce emissions from transportation.\n"

Toronto cannot beat gridlock by making more room for cars, nor should it be removing no-emissions methods of transportation in favor of more driving.

        "comment": "Removal of bike lanes that have already been constructed is a huge waste of taxpayers' money for no return. There is no evidence that bike lanes slow traffic, and lots of evidence that they help traffic to flow more smoothly. And, separated bike lanes make it way safer for cyclists. Too many cyclists have been killed or injured in areas where separated bike lanes do not exist. Please look to Montreal to see how their extensive network of bike lanes results in less traffic congestion and safer rides for cycle commuters. Removing the well-planned and well-considered bike lanes in Toronto will be a huge step BACKWARDS for Ontario. Mr. Doug Ford, please do the right thing and reverse this ill-considered decision. Thank you.\n"

        "comment": "Please rename this bill to accurately reflect what it is trying to do. My suggestion would be, \"Bill 212: increasing gridlock and making Toronto worse for everyone, especially those that live there, 2024\"\n1) I thought Conservatives were for saving money. This is a proposal to waste taxpayer money to destroy things that were just constructed\n2) I thought Conservatives were for small government. The proposal seems to aim for heavy handed additional layers of socialist-style top-down bureaucracy.\n3) I thought Conservatives were pro family. The proposed legislation will make kids less independent and will definitely lead to more dead kids on the road.\n4) I thought Conservatives were in favor of consumer choice. This legislation seems to want to force more people into one method of transportation: driving. Why? Is it not obvious this will lead to more cars on the road and more congestion?\n5) I thought Conservatives were pro business. The legislation will hurt all the businesses along these streets.\n6) I don't understand why the province wants to meddle in municipal affairs. Are you going to create a shadow transportation office for every town in Ontario?\nThese facts are not new. The provincial government is already aware of them and knows its proposal will not help with traffic. I am a voter that likes the idea of business friendly leadership and saving public money. Since this proposal does neither of those things, rather the opposite, if this passes there is no chance I will be voting Conservative. And if I am killed while biking along Bloor street, you can be certain that my obituary will make it clear who has the blood on their hands.\n"

        "comment": "Pulling out bike lanes to reduce congestion is not based on any of the available science that has been done on bike lanes.  This seems a political move designed to appeal to people who don't live within cities, where bike lanes help to keep cars and bicycles separate and safer.\nBike lane usage consistently increases where they are installed, and every bicycle on the street is reducing congestion, be it removing a car, or removing a passenger on some form of transit.\n"

        "comment": "Putting priority on reducing gridlock in a city, rather than protecting cyclists and reducing injuries is actually an outrageous proposal.\nThere are ~3 million people in Toronto, there will never be enough lanes to eliminate traffic unless we tear down buildings and destroy the current infrastructure. From the City of Toronto\u2019s study on cycling in 2019, it was reported that ~70% (varies by district) of the population are cyclists (both recreational and utilitarian). Removing bikes lanes is increasing the chances of injuries and deaths for the 70%. Per the report, Torontonians are twice as likely to say they\u2019re comfortable biking on major roads with a bike lane as opposed to no bike lane.\nFrom a personal perspective, biking is the most affordable way for me to get around. Having ridden on Bloor St. W and Spadina Rd., I can say that I feel much more safe in the Bloor St. bike lanes. Safe drivers/cyclists are the predictable ones, removing bike lanes only brings cyclists into the rest of traffic and creates more unpredictable situations. Twice I have fallen while riding on the street, the first time was in a lane while the second was in the middle of traffic. If not for the slow traffic, I would have absolutely been run over by a car. That wasn\u2019t even a concern during my first fall.\nAlways prioritize safety, not money. There are no workers to exploit if they\u2019re all disabled or dead.\n"

        "comment": "Cycling lanes are an important aspect of safety for Ontarians. Globally this has been demonstrated for decades, and more and more globally important cities like Paris are putting in cycling infrastructure not removing it. Cycling lanes are need to allow for people to travel where they need, and are more important on primary roads where traffic is heavy. We need to focus on providing safe infrastructure that protects people and encourages safe effective transit. Segregated bike lanes provide that protection while reducing the number of cars on the road, reducing potential traffic congestion. It promotes health reduces pollution and reduces provincial costs. Cyclists in these areas are local, and are more supportive of the stores and shops in the area, they promote and support the local economy.  Drivers passing threw the area on their way elsewhere do not.  The cyclists using these roads will not go away with the removal of bike lanes. Many will be forced to interact with traffic, increasing their safety risks. The others will now have to resort to driving on that same road, increasing traffic congestion.\nThe reversal and removal of vital and important traffic infrastructure is not just a waste of financial resources, but is placing Ontarians health and safety at risk.\n"

We are the ones who have to deal with the drivers coming in from 905 who clog up our roads. I have zero concerns about gridlock. Please make it harder to drive so people are forced to take public transit or bike or walk.

Every morning these lanes are filled with other commuters. If we all took a car to get to work, the sheer volume of cars on the road would increase dramatically. Toronto needs more bike lanes, as they take up less space and move more people faster. You alleviate traffic by using bike lanes, not cause it. On street parking causes traffic, people not using transit or active transportation causes gridlock. Dont punish the people who cant afford a car, they are not the issue. Its those who use a car for a single person trip that could easily be completed if proper active transportation infrastructure is in place.\n"
