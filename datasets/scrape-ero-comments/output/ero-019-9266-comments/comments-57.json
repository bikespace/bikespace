There is no evidence that increasing car lanes decreases congestion, but there is plenty of evidence that adding lanes increases traffic and congestion, it's called induced demand. Ontario should be investing in public transit and active transportation, not wasting tax dollars and this for Doug Ford and his pals. Ford should also let municipalities do the right, evidenced-based thing and stop meddling. How about working on our healthcare and education systems instead of beer, beer, beer, cars, beer.\n"

        "comment": "This is an absurd overreach of the provincial government. Individual cities and municipalities are capable of their own urban planning and independent studies in determining the best places for bike lanes for their local populations.\nIf there was a push to get more people on bikes we would significantly reduce gridlock. If we were all able to work from home, we would be able to reduce gridlock. The bikes will be on the road regardless of the bike lanes, but having the bike lanes keeps the slower moving cyclists off the roads instead of adding a navigational hazard for motorists while keeping cyclists safer. This is a major step backwards.\nMore street is not the answer to gridlock. People and the way they drive in a selfish and aggressive manor are the main contributor to gridlock, not the presence of bike lanes.\n"

As a driver, bike lanes make it clear when and where to expect cyclists and increase my safety as well. This proposal will not change traffic flows and is a step backwards for safety, the environment, and livability of our cities.\n"

This is complete insanity. This regressive policy will force people who rely on cycling for transportation like myself to get in a car and add the to mess of traffic. Adding lanes of traffic (even when not at the expense of bike lanes) does not improve traffic congestion due to induced demand (see link below). I do not support this policy.\n"

There have been hundreds of studies done, which prove that separate and safe bike lanes reduce traffic in cities. We should be basing decisions on research and science, not on one politician's personal 'feeling', which most likely stemmed from an annoyance when bikers pass them while they're sitting in traffic.\nI will be very embarrassed to live in Ontario if this law is passed.\n"

I use them multiple times a week to visit friends and play at the volleyball league I belong to.\nI also often use the University lanes to get from downtown to the waterfront. It is a lot more safe than the painted lanes on Bay.\nThanks to the safety of the bike lanes, I sold my car, and now I don't need to contribute to car traffic. I'm saving money on insurance and upkeep.\nThese protected bike lanes are important for my safety. Without them, I would often be forced to ride in front of cars. And I will continue to bike. But I will be slower than cars on a bike. That will not help speed traffic.\nI bike 11 months of the year. Toronto doesn't snow much, so it is easy to bike here. Montreal has more snow and more bike lanes, so winter is not an excuse.\nImagine everyone else decided to use their weekend car every day instead. Sure, you will have an extra lane on the road, but it doesn't take many cars to fill up a road. Bikes are a lot more compact. So the small bike lanes can carry many more people than the general car lane.\nPlease do not remove the existing bike lanes. We actually don't have enough. Going back to the unsafe road layouts we had before is not good for anyone.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my deep concern and strong opposition to Bill 212, Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024. The proposed framework within this bill to grant provincial veto power over bike lanes, particularly when their installation removes a vehicle lane, undermines key values of equitable transportation, public health, and environmental sustainability. This legislation poses a significant threat to urban mobility and ignores the growing need for alternative, sustainable transportation infrastructure.\nBike lanes serve as more than just an avenue for cyclists\u2014they are a means to promote cleaner air, reduce congestion, and offer a healthy, affordable transportation option for residents of all socioeconomic backgrounds. By discouraging the development of such infrastructure, Bill 212 runs counter to the global push toward greener, more livable cities. In fact, reducing reliance on cars and enhancing bicycle infrastructure directly addresses the traffic gridlock the bill purports to solve.\nRemoving bike lanes on arterial roads like Bloor, University, or Yonge Streets would have devastating consequences, reversing the progress made in cities like Toronto to foster safe, accessible transportation options for all. These streets, and others like them, should be spaces where different forms of mobility\u2014cars, bicycles, and pedestrians\u2014can coexist, promoting a healthy balance of transportation modes. To suggest that a return to prioritizing car traffic over active transportation is necessary for city function is both shortsighted and harmful.\nMoreover, Bill 212's emphasis on accelerating highway projects and easing environmental assessments not only sidesteps critical oversight but also exacerbates issues related to climate change. Transportation accounts for a significant portion of Ontario's greenhouse gas emissions, and expanding highway infrastructure while limiting active transportation options will only deepen the province's carbon footprint.\nThe future of urban transportation lies in encouraging diverse forms of mobility\u2014not just private vehicles. Bike lanes contribute to a safer, healthier, and more connected community. Rather than restricting their development, the Ontario government should be working collaboratively with municipalities to expand bike-friendly infrastructure and invest in modern, inclusive transportation systems.\nI strongly urge you to reconsider Bill 212 and its detrimental impacts on sustainable transportation, health, and the environment. The equitable, forward-thinking path is to support and expand cycling infrastructure across Ontario\u2014not to undermine it.\n"

        "comment": "This is a terrible proposal, with no real motivation other than to win points during election season and appease drivers.  By overstepping authority, ignoring the planning autonomy of municipalities and creating yet another layer of red tape, it will actively discourage alternative modes of transportation (bikes and e-bikes), making the roads both more dangerous for existing users and more forcing more people into cars or ubers etc.  From all accounts, these policy changes are not based on any evidence other than anecdotal accounts from drivers along Bloor Street in Toronto.  Encouraging people to use public transit and other forms of non-car transportation should be encouraged, not discouraged.  The environmental cost of all the vehicles on the road (especially thanks to companies like Uber, which have little regard for municipal, safety or environmental regulations) is large, and we should be promoting cycling infrastructure.  The fact that the provincial government is going to \"review\" existing bike lanes is outrageous and will potentially undo years of progress to making the streets safer for *all* road users.\nThe insistence on highway 413 is also ridiculous, and will do lasting damage to the environment and green space.  There are environmental assessments still to be completed, and drafting legislation that allows for the government to skirt those is irresponsible at best.  In plowing ahead with this project, the government is ignoring their own studies which show extremely limited benefit to the highway, as well as the potential environmental course.  Please instead invest in better and more efficiently-built public transit.\n"

There are literally zero downsides, other than people's perceptions of increased traffic due to an inability to actually assess this impartially.\nPolice, fire, and ambulance have reported no increase in response times due to bike lanes. Incidence of accidents for all forms of commuters have been reduced.\nEvery single progressive city in the world is embracing the transition to alternate forms of transport because it is literally impossible for car usage to remain the same or grow and travel times not to increase.\nThis policy is regressive, punitive, discriminates against lower income individuals, is a complete waste of money, and is unjustifiable in any regard.\n"

        "comment": "Why is this government focused on spending money on things that will help no one while actively and directly making life worse for others?\nSomehow the government can waste money on this actively harmful policy, yet it's apparently too expensive to spend money on things that would benefit everyone in the province:  healthcare, education, public transit etc.\nAll evidence shows that adding car lanes does not prevent congestion and can even make it worse. We also know that some cyclists and other light vehicles users will be hurt or killed as a direct result of this policy.\nFurthermore, this policy is not going to stop bikes from riding on streets without bike lanes.  Instead they will be in the car lanes (as they are legally entitled to be), making traffic worse while being less safe themselves.\nIf you support this bill, there is blood on your hands.  You would be wasting money, actively making people's lives worse, and getting nothing in return.\nShame on you if you support this bill.\n"

        "comment": "Since the 50's governments have been expanding lanes and highways to accommodate traffic. And every single time this has led to more traffic as it incentivizes people to drive more and, in turn, this creates even more traffic. While not every bike lane is perfect and there much that can be done to improve them and make them work better with vehicular traffic, they are part of the solution. If you want to look for ways to improve vehicular circulation, you can start by looking at all the space wasted on parked cars. In the end, a city needs to provide people options to safely move around. And we cannot simply dictate that one method is better than the other. We need safe and affordable transportation. And that's exactly what bikes and public transit provide.\n"

Cities around the world are moving towards implementing bike lanes will real results and this Conservative government is moving backwards in time. Induced demand by adding lanes for car traffic is proven to increase travel times. This has been studied for decades and proven time and time again. Connect the bicycle network and let it actually work. Piecemeal solutions never work. This bill caters towards a minority of residents that want to maintain the status quo. Toronto is changing, and our infrastructure has to change with it. I am an Urban Planning professional, car driver, transit user and cyclist. Toronto should be evolving, not regressing. Stop this bill immediately. It is not popular amongst the majority of people.\n"

Making transit more accessible and getting cars off the road should be the focus and not targeting cycling infrastructure which helps to keep vulnerable road users safe. Municipalities have already gone to great lengths to support cycling infrastructure and the provincial government saying they will provide money to rip it out is also a total waste. I do not support this legislation. The provincial government should provide money to make transit and cycling infrastructure better and learn lessons from European cities who have done so successfully.\n"

I have found that cycling is one of the best things I can do to stay fit, and that the stress (one of the largest causes of disease in Canada) that I experience while cycling in a dedicated cycling lane is much, much lower than the stress of driving in a car.\nI don't just cycle for exercise, I cycle practically. I bike to the grocery store to buy groceries. I bike to restaurants, I bike to my job. If I'm on my bike, I am not merely pedalling, I am in the midst of doing something practical that helps the Ontario economy. That's why I vigorously disagree with the idea that bike lanes can be \"moved\" to sidestreets and parks. If there is no long, interconnected grid of cycle lanes (like Bloor Street in Toronto) connecting starting points and destinations, the entire cycling infrastructure becomes useless. Telling cyclists to simply \"go on side streets\" is as ridiculous as telling drivers that they don't need to drive on major streets, they can simply get all of their driving done on side streets. This proposed law is badly misguided in who cyclists are and how bike lanes work.\nCyclists are residents. Cyclists are the economy. Cyclists are the nurses biking to work at the hospital and the delivery gig workers making sure your dinner arrives.\nI wholeheartedly disagree with the Ontario Government making this a political wedge issue in our cities and interfering in municipal infrastructure matters in this way.\n"
