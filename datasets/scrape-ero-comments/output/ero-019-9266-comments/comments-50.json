        "comment": "I am very worried about this. Cycle lanes are a proven net positive: they reduce emissions, increase traffic safety for all, and make very little different to commute times for drivers and improve commute times for everyone else. I'm truly not sure why Premier Ford wants to spend more tax payer money to remove them after spending so much to install them.... and with no proof of benefit? This bill just seems to paint the blame for congestion on cyclists for no reason other than political points.\nWill there be a requirement for in-depth and long-term studies before bike lanes are removed? Or only for cities wishing to install them?\n"

        "comment": "This is what I wrote - feel free to grab what you want from it and use it as your own!\nHello!\nI support bike lines.\nWe know from evidence that bike lanes help to:\n- reduce gridlock\n- reduce greenhouse gases\n- get people moving faster\nBike lanes are not just a matter of convenience; they are vital for many residents who rely on affordable transportation options. Delivery drivers, including those in food and courier services, as well as individuals who simply cannot afford vehicles due to the high cost of living, depend on both public transportation and bike lanes to move around the city. The rising cost of living has made car ownership unattainable for many, further highlighting the need for equitable, accessible alternatives like cycling infrastructure.\nWe must also recognize that traffic congestion is self-perpetuating. More cars on the road lead to more traffic. It\u2019s a cycle that anyone who takes a moment to reflect on the situation would easily understand. Expanding bike lanes offers an opportunity to break this cycle by encouraging more people to use alternative modes of transport, thereby reducing overall congestion and improving the flow of traffic for everyone.\nInvesting in safe, accessible bike infrastructure is essential for the health, safety, and well-being of our communities, as well as for addressing the city\u2019s pressing environmental and transportation challenges. These actions are not only distractions from the real needs of our city but also betray a lack of vision and leadership when it comes to addressing urban challenges. Bike lanes are a practical, immediate step that can provide tangible benefits for Toronto residents, but we need all levels of government working together, in good faith, to make them a reality.\nWe need a government that supports making decisions that are based in evidence.\n"

        "comment": "In 2023, there was only one cyclist death recorded in the city of Toronto. In 2024, we have already had 6 and the year is not even over. We as a province should be finding ways to make cycling MORE safe in cities not less. With all of the existing construction projects that are clogging up city streets it\u2019s becoming more dangerous for bikers. A girl was killed and Bloor and Avenue this summer because she had to merge out of the safe bike lane into traffic because of a DUMPSTER blocking the bike lane. All of these deaths are completely preventable with the right infrastructure. The perfect example of this is the Adelaide St bike corridor in Toronto. During the construction on Adelaide when the bike lane was closed there were almost no bikers on the street. Once construction was complete and a safe bike lane was done there are now more bikes travelling down that road everyday than cars. People will bike if they feel safe on the roads. As a society we should be doing more and more to encourage alternate modes of transportation to fix traffic issues. Cars cause traffic not bikes. We should be investing in safe and reliable public transit, MORE bike lanes, illegal parking enforcement on major transit corridors, and consistent Go Train service. Studies show that bike lanes improve the flow of traffic, not hurt it. At any hour of the day if you go down King st, Adelaide or Richmond there are dozens of cars illegally parked forcing everyone to merge around them causing blocks and blocks of backup. An easy solution would be to have parking officers patrol those streets during rush hour and enforce the no parking rules to keep traffic moving. Lastly, a blanket solution for the entire Province will not solve this issue. What works in a small municipality like Stratford or Barrie does not work in a complex, highly populated city like Toronto. This should be a law that is decided upon by each municipality who understands the complexity and nuance of their individual communities, not something that the Province dictates. The last thing the city needs right now is more construction, taking out bike lanes is taking a huge step backward in the progress we are making. Try driving down University avenue during rush hour right now with all the Ontario line construction and turn left on Queen and tell me that MORE construction in that area would make anything better.\n"

        "comment": "This is a terrible idea. This will not save time and is a complete waste of tax dollars. Doug Ford is not the mayor of Toronto and should not decide local issues on local streets. If the current government wants to address congestion then properly fund public transit, finish existing transit projects, and follow provincial policy which directs that we should be supporting active transportation. The government just wasted time creating the new Provincial Planning Statement, which focuses on supporting active transportation not cars. This legislation is just plain dumb. No honest politician who actually wants to solve a problem would vote for this.\n"

        "comment": "The proposed legislation seems to aim to increase gridlock. Some people who currently get around by bike will be forced into cars resulting in more cars on the road and more gridlock. How are legislators still confused by this?\nWhy are politicians, who are in theory supposed to represent the people of Toronto, working so hard to make the city worse? This legislation seems to aim for louder, more dangerous, more polluted streets with fewer pedestrians and significantly less business activity. I thought elected representatives are supposed to try to improve the lives of the people they represent, not make them more frustrated, less healthy and poorer.\nHow is incentivizing more car travel a responsible policy? You are taking options away from people. I thought the government is for less regulation and more freedom of choice. Now the goal is building in heavy-handed additional layers of politburo-style red tape? What on earth is going on here?\nHonestly, this proposal is the exact opposite of what Toronto needs. And it's not like it is difficult to find resources about how to improve a city. Hint: more car dependence is NOT THE SOLUTION. This type of proposal is an indication of deliberate hostility to the people of Toronto, willful ignorance or utter stupidity.\nThe fact that this is still a discussion is actually an embarrassment to the province of Ontario. Every major street should have a bike lane. This is honestly exhausting. You have already been told the answer for decades.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes should not trump traffic lanes. Most bicyclists I encounter do not stop at red lights, weave in and out of traffic and cut people off.  If they followed the rules that drivers have to, it wouldn\u2019t be so bad sharing a road.  Why aren\u2019t cops ticketing them when they run a red light?  Realistically most people will not bike to work even if it was an option. Arriving at work sweaty and dirty from weather, dust, mud, etc. With no place to shower at work, is a ridiculous ask to the general public.  Most of us can\u2019t afford to live in a city and are forced to live out of town.  The people demanding more bike lanes are small in quantity and should not outweigh the voices of the many. I think you need a referendum to hear from the actual public voters, and not just political figures, the media or government officials, not on just this subject but on MANY subjects the government is just making huge and impactful decisions for the public without even asking us what we want.\n"

        "comment": "This is awful. If you want to free up space for drivers and reduce traffic, we need more bike lanes, not fewer. People who choose to cycle rather than drive take up much less than cars. Bike lanes encourage far more people to do so. When we\u2019re forced to drive, traffic goes up!\nMore bike lanes = more cyclists = fewer drivers = less traffic.\nCycling is also a much healthier choice, both for people and the planet. And with bike lanes, it\u2019s safer. My wife won\u2019t cycle without lanes because it\u2019s too dangerous\u2014instead she will drive.\nCars have ruined lives, ruined our cities, and ruined our planet.

        "comment": "Bike lanes have been show to have a positive impact on traffic reduction because when biking is safe (bike lanes are present) more people see this as a viable mode of transit. Therefore, people who would otherwise drive are more willing to take their bike or use readily available city bikes from a nearby dock. From my personal experience I\u2019m way less willing to bike on streets that do that have bike lanes especially when it is a very traversed street. This safety factor it\u2019s important and bikes should be afforded the same protection as people in vehicles. This can only be accomplished by having more bike lanes for cyclists to use. Additionally, more vehicle lanes just result in more people purchasing cars which results in more cars on the highway which results in more traffic and consequently more accidents. This is not a sustainable solution. The clear solution is to improve transit options, avoid choke points (like union station) and provide alternatives to driving a car (bikes in bike lanes) which will lead to people choosing those modes instead of driving and transit is much safer and efficient than a single person driving a long commute to get to work\n"

We went through months and months of construction traffic to get these in, please don't make all this money and time for nothing.\nI am a driver in Toronto and I do not find that the University bike lanes add ANY traffic to my route. In fact, I find it moves smoother because there are less cars blocking the roads. What really causes traffic for me downtown is cars stopped at rush hour in live lanes, and cars blocking intersections. This bike lane actually helps by organizing cyclists into their own lanes so they are not on the roads and keeps them safe. Please do not waste our tax payer dollars this way. The work done looks excellent, and it is a complete waste to do this, and I guarantee it will not help with traffic at all. It will be on YOU to explain to drivers why they are waiting in traffic longer during the construction and afterwards, and it will be on YOU when the first cyclist dies from these changes.\n"
