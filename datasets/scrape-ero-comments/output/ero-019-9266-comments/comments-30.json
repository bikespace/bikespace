        "comment": "I fully support the development of more bike lanes in our community. It\u2019s clear from evidence that they play an essential role in reducing overall traffic congestion, improving road safety, and encouraging more sustainable modes of transportation. When more people have safe, dedicated spaces to ride, it results in fewer cars on the road, which directly reduces traffic for everyone\u2014drivers included. Additionally, less dependency on cars means more disposable income for the average Ontarian. That means more money to spend on necessities or investments into their registered accounts rather than payments on car loans and car insurance. Diverse choices in transportation is the affordable option for the vast majority of Ontarians.\nMoreover, municipal governments are in the best position to make decisions about bike lane construction. They understand local traffic patterns, infrastructure needs, and the unique demands of their communities. Offloading this to the provincial government creates unnecessary strain on the resources of the provincial government and a sizable lag in retrieving accurate data. The leadership of municipal governments ensures that bike lanes are built where they are most needed and are designed to integrate effectively with the rest of the transportation network.\nBike lanes aren\u2019t just a benefit for cyclists\u2014they create a ripple effect that makes cities more livable, safer, and environmentally responsible for all residents. Let\u2019s trust our local governments to keep pushing for these vital projects.\nThank you for your consideration.\nM1R 5G9\n"

        "comment": "Bike lane installations already require an assessment of the road corridor, the use of the road right-of-way, the impact on traffic, and an assessment of whether it is a net good for the municipality. Requiring municipalities to constantly submit proposals for new bike infrastructure to the province is an overstep that serves to add red tape in the planning process that onerous on cash strapped cities. There are no criteria published for what would allow for a lane of traffic to be removed, which is concerning and suggests this is politically motivated, not logically motivated. Municipalities already have elections where residents are welcome to vote out the existing leadership if they don\u2019t like the direction of their cities. Paternally reviewing every single bike lane proposal they are considering is not only unnecessary, it is adding additional layers of governmental and political review that don\u2019t need to exist and overrides the will of the residents living in that area.\nWhy does the province view this as their challenge to solve when they don\u2019t design the roads, don\u2019t maintain the road network, and aren\u2019t responsible for its upkeep? It seems punitive to require a municipality to maintain all of its lanes of traffic, even if the municipality no longer wants or is able to maintain it.\nIn larger cities like Toronto, the reality is traffic will never be good, nor should we expect it to be. There are simply too many people driving in the city and this will ONLY be addressed through adequate alternative transportation means. There are decades of transportation planning and engineering research to support this - it is not an ideological view but a realistic one.\nThe announcements surrounding this project identify \u201cmajor arterials\u201d as poor fits for cycling infrastructure. On the contrary, major roads are exactly where you want to provide active transportation and public transit, because that is where people are and where they are going. Bike lanes are only used when they are safe and useful, as part of a connected network. In the same way a driver would be less likely to drive if they could only drive on side streets, a cyclist is less likely to bike if they do not have adequate access to major destinations.\nThis act, in combination with the other car-oriented acts being proposed by the province, do not move us to a more sustainable transportation network and will entrench decades of poor land use and mode share. The environmental impact of further building outward is not only borne from fossil fuel use in current vehicles - it is also from expanding energy needs and removing additional green space and farmland. The reality is we need to work together to figure out how best to move the majority of people in large cities without cars.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes along with transit investment is what is needed in Southern Ontario going forward. Adding \"just one more lane\" for vehicles will have 0 impact on traffic, while increasing the danger for cyclists, scooter riders and people in mobility scooters, all of which use bike lanes.\nThere is also no evidence whatsoever that show bike lanes cause congestion. The government claims they do, yet provide absolutely no evidence, meanwhile there are countless studies across Canada and the entire world that show they are a net positive.\nIt's also disgraceful that the entire province has to suffer from this backwards 'law', all because Ford doesn't want to see 3 bike lanes on his drive to Queens Park.\n"

        "comment": "I'm writing to express concern about the bill's clause to \"enable provincial approval authority for the installation of new bike lanes on municipal roads, where the removal of a vehicle lane is required\". Municipalities are by far the best judges of how their roads are used. Requiring provincial approval for new bike lanes adds needless new red tape for municipalities trying to improve their roads and traffic flows. Studies in both Canadian (https://www-tandfonline-com/doi/full/10.1080/15568318.2014.890767) and international (https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-63280-8_42) contexts show that dedicated bicycle lanes do not substantially contribute to traffic congestion but, rather to the contrary, often decrease traffic congestion. As the province continues to deal with traffic issues, it needs to adopt a data-driven, forward-thinking approach rather than making political plays and using outdated approaches that have consistently failed to improve the lives of taxpayers.\n"

        "comment": "Regarding the idea of traffic lane removal in urban centers: you can't \"fight\" the gridlock by continuing to encourage increased automobile usage.\nIt doesn't matter how many lanes you build into cities, the cities are already at capacity. That is why gridlock exists--because so many individuals are trying to commute in using inefficient methods of commuting.\nIf you want urban density, then you need to have denser forms of transport as well--cities cannot accommodate car ownership for each and every individual from the surrounding region--it is just not possible. Cities are already being stretched to the limit of what is possible, and that is what you get gridlock from.\nYou can't add more traffic lanes inside the city everywhere without razing buildings(never going to happen) so gridlock will never go away if you keep trying to stuff more and more cars into cities.\nThe only way you will get rid of gridlock is if you decrease the number of cars on the road. It's not what a lot of people want to hear, but that's the only way you'll ever make it happen.\nThe only way you get that is if people don't need to own a car to get around. To do that, you need to provide a viable alternative--we need even more investments in public transit and we need to encourage and facilitate smaller forms of transport such as cycling. One could look at the example set by Britain, they have a program called the 'Cycle to Work Scheme' where folks are incentivized to ride to work by getting a tax-free purchase of a bicycle through an employee benefit.\nEven if you *could* potentially raze a city and rebuild it from the ground up with 6 to 8 lane roads everywhere, that would be a completely different kind of place--if that's what you want, there are plenty of suburbs in Ontario built like that already. Car-centered urban planning has had its way in North America since the mid 20th century--but populations are reaching a point where that's not practical anymore. Let dense urban places be their own thing--we won't lose as a society by giving something else a chance.\nAs an addendum, legislation for building out telecom/broadband should be separated out from legislation concerning traffic planning and has no place on the same bill.\nAttached, for anyone who would be curious is a document detailing the British Cycle to Work Scheme.\n"

Public transit in this province needs to be quick, affordable and cheap. And bike lanes serve as a reliable alternative. 60% of one way household vehicle trips are under 10km. There are a lot of good reasons people might need to use a car for that trek but there are many, many reasons people should consider switching to a bike for that trek. With the proper cycling infrastructure - many people may choose a more environmentally friendly choice (biking). \u201cIf you build it, they will come.\u201d\nThose who cycle are deserving of safe and accurate infrastructure.

The elimination or reduction of these will result in people choosing more congestion-impacting modes, such as driving.\n- Plus, in a 2019 report, businesses on Bloor St. in Toronto reported receiving more business after the bike lanes were installed.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 - Reducing Gridlock, Saving you Time Act, 2024 - Framework for bike lanes that require removal of a traffic lane is a seriously disappointing and disgracefully short sighted proposal on behalf of the provincial government.\nAs such, I am writing to show my household\u2019s strong support for bike lines (and serious disappointment in the recent announcements from the provincial government and the premier\u2019s office relating to their removal or limitations on their construction).\nWe know from evidence that among many other benefits, bike lanes help to:\n- reduce gridlock\n- reduce greenhouse gases\n- get people moving faster\nBike lanes are not just a matter of convenience; they are vital for many residents who rely on affordable transportation options. Many individuals who simply cannot afford vehicles due to the high cost of living, depend on both public transportation and bike lanes to move around the city. The rising cost of living has made car ownership unattainable for many, further highlighting the need for equitable, accessible alternatives like cycling infrastructure.\nWe must also recognize that traffic congestion is self-perpetuating. More cars on the road lead to more traffic. It\u2019s a blatantly obvious cycle that anyone who takes a moment to reflect on the situation would easily understand. Expanding bike lanes offers an opportunity to break this cycle by encouraging more people to use alternative modes of transport, thereby reducing overall congestion and improving the flow of traffic for everyone.\nInvesting in safe, accessible bike infrastructure is essential for the health, safety, and well-being of our communities, as well as for addressing the city\u2019s pressing environmental and transportation challenges. These actions are not only distractions from the real needs of our provincial capital and province but also betray a lack of vision and leadership when it comes to addressing urban challenges. Bike lanes are a practical, immediate step that can provide tangible benefits for Toronto and Ontario residents, but we need all levels of government working together, in good faith, to make them a reality.\nWe need a government that supports making decisions that are based in evidence.\nI feel quite embarrassed and sad for the policy designers who have to write bad policy, based on emotion, hatred and jealousy - all in order to distract the voters from the real problems (i.e. the province\u2018s inability to actually get people moving by investing in regional transportation solutions, and failure to actually get a project completed in time or in budget).\n"

It is an egregious overstepping of the provincial government, and for a bill that is completely unsupported by scientific evidence.\nBike lanes do not create gridlock. In fact, bike lanes are capable of supporting significantly more demand than car lanes ever could. Statistics that grid lock have worsened in Toronto (and Ontario) as a whole are a result of population growth, as well as economic changes post-pandemic which have meant people are leaving their homes more often to attend events and socialize. These factors have nothing to do with bike lanes.\nBike lanes are an essential part of Ontario\u2019s infrastructure. They encourage more sustainable (not only environmentally, but in terms of literal footprint) transportation options. These transportation options CAN accommodate Ontario\u2019s continued growth, unlike additional car lanes which will become gridlocked again within 1-3 years due to induced demand.\nOntario does not need more car lanes. In fact, we probably need fewer.\n"

Targeting on-street parking, which takes up valuable road space to store a car, is a much more worthwhile use of resources. Bike lanes allow for fast travel for bikers, incentivizing others who want to get around the city faster to try it and take cars off the road. Less cars on the road means less cars stuck in gridlock so that the cars that need to be on the road (trucks, accessibility, streetcars, busses, etc) do not have to compete with people who could accomplish their travel needs with a bike or public transit.\n"

I have perspective from both sides.\nAs a driver, my biggest frustration by far, is the presence of other cars on the road.
