        "comment": "I believe that removing bike lanes in Toronto would be a step backwards for our city's future. Bike lanes make the city safer for cyclists, reduce traffic congestion by offering a safe alternative option to driving, improve our air quality, and promote public health. In a city that is increasingly overpopulated and expensive, biking is an economical alternative for commuters, and I am seriously concerned for the safety of cyclists if the bike lanes are removed. Additionally, it is a waste of our taxpayer dollars to rip up infrastructure that has already been invested. I truly hope lawmakers will recognize that our bike infrastructure is an investment in a more sustainable city for everyone.\n"

        "comment": "I would like to vigorously protest the provisions of this Bill, regarding the removal of existing bike lanes in Toronto, as well as the quashing of plans for the future creation of bike lanes on Toronto and surrounding streets and roads that would be well-served by having bike lanes.  My concerns are primarily in two areas:\n1) Bike lanes and cycling infrastructure in large urban communities like Toronto benefit both cyclists and non-cyclists alike, by reducing traffic pollution, parking problems for cars and other large vehicles and (yes, it's true) even traffic congestion and gridlock.  That is why large, truly world-class Western cities like New York, London and Paris, with larger populations and more complex roadways than Toronto, have all chosen to advance bike commutation and general transport by bike by constructing bike-only lanes and improving streets for bicycle use generally. Toronto has aspirations to being a \"world-class city,\" but so long as it allows the province to prioritize cars over people and spout inane drivel about the \"war on the car,\" Toronto will remain a bush-league vassal of a bush-league province.\n2) The province has no right morally (and shouldn't either, legally) to legislate on purely municipal issues. Very few provincial ministers, including the Premier, live in the centre of Toronto or have any apparent affection for or understanding of the place.  The invocation of the notwithstanding clause in order to halve the size of Toronto City Council a few years ago is the perfect example of intrusion by the province in a city's business, and the desire to control what should be controlled by the local city council.  Now, bringing non-urban ideas and philosophies into the city core is another example, just as egregious, of the province huffing and puffing its way into the city's business, at the expense of citizens (why can't that $48 million it would take to demolish existing bike lanes be used to get people into affordable housing and/or supply food banks and generally service the populus, instead of tyrannizing bike riders? Please dump this ridiculous idea and let Toronto deal with traffic and air-quality problems in intelligent ways, one of which is the encouragement of non-motorized bicycle transport.  Thank you\n"

All of these are working class people bootstrapping their careers and working lives by making sacrifices, like  foregoing cars and public transportation, in order to be able to get to work, do their jobs, pay their taxes, and save to be able to move up the social ladder.\nDo the working-class people in larger cities not deserve a safe and reliable way to work and get to work, when bikes are the only financially viable option? What solution does Ontario offer to working-class members of the city's community that rely on bikes to make ends meet and keep themselves employed for the good of themselves and their city?\n"

        "comment": "Preserving bike lanes while removing street parking can significantly improve urban traffic flow and safety. Research shows that bike lanes do not increase congestion; instead, they often reduce it by encouraging cycling and decreasing car dependency[1][5]. Cities like Paris and New York have successfully implemented bike lanes, resulting in increased cycling rates and reduced car usage[1][5]. Removing street parking can create more space for bike lanes, enhancing road efficiency and safety for cyclists and pedestrians. This approach aligns with modern urban planning principles that prioritize sustainable and safe transportation options[4][5].\nCitations:\n[1] Do bike lanes really cause more traffic congestion?

Studies show that cyclists often spend as much or more than car drivers, as they tend to visit shops more frequently[1][2]. Cities like New York and San Francisco have seen significant increases in retail sales after installing bike lanes, with businesses reporting up to a 50% increase in sales receipts[2][4].

        "comment": "The proposal to remove sections of the Bloor, University and Yonge bike lanes is a tremendous mistake. The city of Toronto has built excellent biking infrastructure along these routes which provide safe and effective transport. I, and many other Ontarians use these bike lanes on a regular basis in place of driving within the city. The removal of these bike lanes and restrictions on the construction of new lanes will lead to more cars on the road. This will not only add to congestion but hurt businesses and communities along these routes. Additionally, the cost associated with removals will be a burden on the Ontario tax payer, and is especially painful considering much of the infrastructure along these routes is brand new.\nI also find the measures exempting Highway 413 from the Environmental Assessment Act concerning.\n"

        "comment": "Hi, I am a resident of Ontario, Toronto, and I am extremely disappointed in the provincial government's decision to remove cycle lanes on important cycling corridors such as Bloor St, University Ave, and Yonge St.\nI am a healthcare worker and I use the cycle lanes on Bloor St W and University Ave to get to work safely and cheaply. In fact, I sold my car to save on car insurance, gas costs, and parking costs. However, the province keeps making life unaffordable to its residents by discouraging them from taking cheaper and sustainable modes of transportation. It is also not taking into consideration the concerns of downtown business owners as they have mentioned that the cycle lanes have increased foot traffic and reduced vacancies in their area. Moreover, as a taxpayer, I am worried about the price tag associated with the removals of the cycle lanes, which leads me to believe that this government is not serious about keeping government spending and the budget deficit under control.\nYet, I do understand that there may be traffic congestion concerns due to the installation of new cycle lanes. I am sure that the province can make a compromise with the city of Toronto and remove the section of bike lanes on Bloor St W in Etobicoke and Yonge St in Toronto, and keep the existing infrastructure on University, Bloor (downtown), as the benefits of cycling infrastructure through the city's downtown far outweigh the perceived drawbacks. I would also agree to a temporary moratorium on new cycling infrastructure until construction projects and lane closures have concluded. Ironically, the highest proportion of lane closures in the city is caused by Metrolinx, under provincial jurisdiction, and not cycle lanes (according to a report by the city of Toronto), which is not a good look for a provincial government that touts itself as easing traffic congestion throughout the province.\nI have never been a political person, but ever since the province proposed Bill 212, which defies common sense, I am becoming increasingly drawn to opposing parties such as the Ontario Liberal Party or the Ontario NDP.\n"

        "comment": "The government of Ontario's proposal to start ripping up bike lanes is short-sighted and will make cycling dangerous while saving drivers just a little bit of time. It is not a healthy option, but rather one that shows the government is not concerned with lowering emissions levels. Privileged individuals who can afford cars will continue to drive instead of taking public transportation or cycling. Why does the government not invest more heavily in public transportation, which in itself should help to keep roads less congested?\n"
