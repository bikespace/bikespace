The existing, and expanding, bike share network ensures I am safe and get home to my family.\nBefore the installation of the bike lanes, I had several near misses, and have had friends hit by cars riding on main streets without protected lanes. The lanes are used constantly throughout the entire year, even winter, especially by delivery workers.\nThis proposed policy will get people killed and goes against all evidence that bike lanes improve commute times for cars, and make the city a safer and more liveable place.\n"

It should go without saying that cars increase congestion. That it has to be said demonstrates the intellectual bankruptcy of this proposal, to say nothing of the fact that, if implemented, the government will be responsible for all injuries that happen to cyclists as a result of streets becoming more unsafe. Shame on the government for proposing something so vapid and craven.\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nI am not in favour of this proposal. Cars are an inefficient mode of transportation for cities, and car infrastructure is very expensive to maintain. Instead of focusing on keeping cars moving by adding more lanes and car-oriented construction, we should be encouraging people who do not NEED to be driving to use alternative modes of transportation. Most people do not want to drive, and by promoting viable alternatives, you get more cars out of the way of people who have no other option.\nBike lanes are for the benefit of drivers, who are frustratingly slowed down or anxious about sharing the road with cars. Each bike in a bike lane is one less car standing in the way of a driver and their destination.\nWe do not need to forge a new trail here. If we look at how other successful cities avoid gridlock, there are many solutions already being implemented around the world. I'm a Toronto resident, and when I look at cities much bigger than Toronto, none of them are prioritizing cars as a means of transportation.\nThis is a huge over-reach from a party that is supposedly in favour of LESS governemnt oversight and less government intervention. There is no reason, besides those purely political, for the provicial government to get involved in local affairs.\nThank you.\n"

        "comment": "As someone who regularly drives, walks and cycles around the city, it's clear that the proposed legislation will not reduce congestion on major roadways. For example, the transportation minister listed University Ave. as one of the major arteries that they'd consider removing the bike lane from, however, as someone who often traverses this street at rush hour, the majority of the congestion is due to cars trying to turn onto the Gardiner, but being unable to do so due to extreme congestion on the Gardiner. How would adding more flow of traffic on University help that? If anything, it would just make congestion even worse, causing excessive pollution and wear and tear on the roads, which would require more maintenance. Frankly, this plan seems poorly thought out and not based in reality. If this government wants to reduce congestion and help reduce emissions, funding green modes of transportation (such as improved biking infrastructure, public transportation enhancement, encouraging walking, promoting carpooling and ride-sharing, investing in smart traffic management systems , etc.) would be the way to do it.\n"

        "comment": "It's quite obvious that if you force more ppl to stop biking and start driving, you will have more gridlock.\nTo reduce gridlock, focus on improving public transit from outside the city. Removing more cars from the roads is the only way forward since we are not building any more streets to accommodate more cars. This is nonsense.\nYou can't fight gridlock with encouraging more cars on the road. The only way is to encourage ppl to take other modes of transportation and make them good so that ppl are convinced to stop driving because it's more inconvenient. It's very simple actually. Stop wasting my tax-paying dollars on this and get to work getting Toronto and the GTA moving with public transit that has already been delayed by a decade.\n"

Delivery drivers, including those in food and courier services, as well as individuals who simply cannot afford vehicles due to the high cost of living, depend on both public transportation and bike lanes to move around the city.

These actions are not only distractions from the real needs of our city but also betray a lack of vision and leadership when it comes to addressing urban challenges. Bike lanes are a practical, immediate step that can provide tangible benefits for Toronto residents, but we need all levels of government working together, in good faith, to make them a reality.\nWe need a government that supports making decisions that are based in evidence.\nI feel quite embarrassed and sad for the policy designers who have to write bad policy, based on emotion, hatred and jealousy - all in order to distract the voters from the real problems (i.e. the province inability to actually get people moving by investing in regional transportation solutions, and not being able to actually get a project completed in time or in budget! yuck!).\nM6G 2S4\n"

Yes, cities are creations of the province but this responsibility has been given to them and should stay there.\n2. Why are you so worried about bike lanes instead of things like the FAILING healthcare system?  Get your priorities straight.\n3. Bikes are traffic.  Under the HTA a cyclist has the right to 'take-the-lane'.  IE stay to the right \u201cwhere practicable\u201d.  When my safety is at risk due to unsafe road conditions, I WILL take the lane.  Having a dedicated bike lane means traffic will flow faster than if I'm taking a 'car' lane.\n"

Cars are through-commuters in the most part.\nIt is not safe for bicycles to ride in the traffic. Under the HTA they can take the rightmost lane but it is dangerous with aggressive drivers who believe (wrongly) that bicycles do not belong on the road.\nThe environmental benefits are obvious, based on GHG emissions reductions through reduced use of personal vehicles and more use of alternatives.\n"

Not just biking, but scooters, skateboards, or other forms of micromobility as well.\nBike lanes also lead to decreased healthcare costs, that far outstrip the cost to implement the bike lanes. This is due to both better health outcomes of more active people, as well as the decrease in pollution.\nBike lanes also lead to good outcomes for businesses. Cyclists are better customers than drivers, stopping in businesses more often, usually leading to increased sales.\nFinally, this legislation feels like the very thing the ministry of red tape reduction exists to eliminate.

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to Bill 212, specifically the framework that requires municipalities to seek provincial approval for new bike lanes that remove existing traffic lanes. This legislation is misguided from a safety, environmental, and traffic congestion perspective.\nThe proposed changes outlined in Bill 212 prioritize the movement of cars over the safety of cyclists. Removing existing bike lanes to add more lanes for cars will make cycling more dangerous. It will discourage people from choosing to cycle, leading to a decrease in cycling and an increase in driving.\nBill 212 is counterproductive to the government\u2019s stated environmental goals. The preamble to the bill states a commitment to \"speeding up the delivery of broadband projects that will connect people in all parts of Ontario, including rural areas, with reliable internet access\". Increasing broadband access, however, will do little to reduce our province\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions if paired with legislation that discourages active transportation. Furthermore, research shows that adding more lanes for vehicle traffic can actually increase traffic congestion due to a phenomenon known as induced demand; so not only does this bill increase the risk to cyclists, it doesn't accomplish its goal of reducing congestion.\nIndependent research indicates that bike lanes do not contribute to traffic congestion, and may, in fact, ease it. The addition of bike lanes has been shown to reduce travel times for cars in some cases, such as a study in New York City cited by the CBC which showed that after the installation of bike lanes on a major midtown thoroughfare, average travel time for cars decreased by 35%. Copenhagen, a city known for its extensive cycling infrastructure, also reports that the high volume of bike traffic actually eases congestion for other vehicles like buses and delivery trucks. These findings suggest that the Ontario government\u2019s claims about reducing congestion by removing bike lanes and adding more lanes for cars are inaccurate.\nI urge the Ontario government to reconsider this harmful legislation. Instead of making it harder for municipalities to implement safe and sustainable transportation options, the province should collaborate with municipalities to expand active transportation infrastructure. This includes investing in a network of protected bike lanes that will make cycling a safe and appealing option for people of all ages and abilities. This shift towards sustainable transportation is essential to improve road safety, reduce traffic congestion, and meet our province\u2019s environmental goals.\n"

        "comment": "This comment is in reference to ERO number 019-9266.\nThe proposed bill is ill-advised. It does not recognize that the cause of congestion is the number of vehicles on the road and the amount of space that each vehicle consumes. Bicycles are highly efficient in terms of the amount of space that they consume (both for bike lanes and per-vehicle space), so removing bike lanes and therefore ability of citizens to be able to bicycle safely in municipalities will lead to more people using cars, taking up more space on the road, and increasing congestion.\nFurthermore, unless a bike lane impacts general road safety (including for pedestrians and bicyclists), consideration of the placement and installation of bike lanes should be left to municipalities, who have the best understanding of local traffic patterns and the needs of their residents.\nIf the proposed bill has any merit, it should be presented as part of a comprehensive plan to \"get the province moving again\", including improving transit, providing more options for citizens to \"move\" without getting into their congestion-causing car, and trying to influence behaviour (such as using economic dis-incentives to driving their cars) to have people fewer people on the road at all/specific times.\n"

        "comment": "Bicycles are never the problem with gridlock. Too many cars is always the problem.\nThe two main issues as I see it are:\n1. Direct on street parking in front of businesses. (Short term to medium term car users park for convenience rather than walk 100m from a Green P, which are everywhere).\n1b. Backing up to parallel park, or exit causes an entire lane to slow down or stop for the sake of on street parking.\n2. Too many cars at one or two times during the day. For example Bloor St in Etobicoke is primarily empty, other than 9am and 5pm. Removing a bike lane won't solve anythIng since extra drivers will show up due to the overall congestion in the city.\nYou can easily get around Bloor steeet and other streets by adjusting your drive schedules if it busy when you want to go. Its Never been a problem. I've lived in Etobicoke for 30+ years and other than a few minutes here or there, its not an issue.\nRemoving bike lanes will temporarily 'ease' gridlock until Waze or Apple maps reroutes every car back onto them and it will be the exact same problem.\nAdjust the bike lanes to be counter-flow, double lanes, or elevated. Safe travel is mandatory for everyone over convenience. Remove 1/2 the on street parking, North or South. Add more green P.\nI ride a bicyle for commuting, for fun, and leisure. I have 3 cars, gas and electric, I don't understand who is so upset by bicycles that they can't understand more cars on the road won't solve the problem. Planning trips, using transit, car pooling, minor changes to your day and you can get around easily.\nDont't make the streets less safe. Enough people have been killed by motorists while walking or on bicycles.\nI must mention, the bike lanes in Mississauga are fabulous. Rathburn, Burnhamthorpe, Queensway etc are wonderful safe options. Toronto is missing the point.\n"
