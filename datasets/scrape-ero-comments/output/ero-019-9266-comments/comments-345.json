        "comment": "Safety and Sustainable Transportation Goals\nRequiring that bicycle lane designs undergo Ministry review, with an emphasis on motor vehicle traffic flow, may conflict with Ontario\u2019s commitments to sustainable and safe transportation. Bike lanes contribute to reducing emissions, improving public health, and supporting a shift toward active transportation. Prioritizing vehicle capacity could unintentionally discourage the development of bike lanes, missing an opportunity to reduce congestion and support safer, greener cities. A focus on sustainable transportation is essential to achieving long-term public health and environmental goals.\nTo align with Ontario\u2019s sustainability objectives, the proposal should prioritize active transportation safety and sustainability benefits. Adjusting the criteria to balance vehicle flow with the benefits of bike lanes could support healthier, more resilient urban areas. For a balanced approach that supports Ontario\u2019s goals, this proposal warrants a more detailed review before being passed into law.\n"

We need to lower our use of cars and address this climate emergency, driven by fossil fuel. Biking, walking and taking public transit will help traffic flow as well as building denser cities. I truly hope the Government listen to the people.\n"

        "comment": "Cost and Resource Implications for Municipalities\nIntroducing an approval process requiring Ministry oversight could increase costs and delay projects, potentially discouraging municipalities, especially smaller ones, from investing in cycling infrastructure. New reporting requirements could divert local resources from other critical projects. This may place a financial strain on municipalities, affecting their ability to advance transportation initiatives. Streamlined processes and guidelines from the Ministry could help reduce these financial impacts and support cost-effective implementation.\nTherefore by streamlining the approval process with simplified reporting and clear, flexible guidelines would help reduce costs and resource strain on municipalities, enabling a more efficient and widespread development of bike infrastructure. This proposal\u2019s potential financial and resource implications for municipalities indicate a need for further review before it becomes legislation.\n"

        "comment": "As a resident of Toronto with two small children who bikes to work regularly, your proposal to remove bike lanes makes no sense to me. The sections of Bloor that have protected bike lanes are the only sections of my drive where I feel safe riding my bike. Is your goal to have more cars on the road adding to traffic congestion and pollution? Removing bike lanes would make me feel much less safe and would lead to me driving to work. This would add to traffic congestion and cost me well over $150 a month for parking (not to mention gas, wear & tear on my car, etc.). This is also a wild overreach of your authority as elected officials at the provincial level. You cannot just step in and make arbitrary decisions for the city because you want to - the city council voted on this and has the support of the citizens of Toronto. There are plenty of problems in the province that you could be focusing on and addressing instead of wading into municipal issues.\nAlso, if you do this, people will literally die. Protected bike lanes save lives. Please don't risk the lives of your citizens.\n"

        "comment": "I don't like the proposal to remove the bike lanes. It seems like the province is pushing municipalities around for no real benefit to anyone. The bike lanes are in place, and it's a waste of taxpayer money to go to all the work of tearing them out at this point. Even if they were removed, you'd still have on-street parking reducing the affected streets by one lane in either direction, so the actual gains for drivers in terms of capacity would be negligible.\nI drive regularly on all of the affected streets in Toronto, and none of them have bad gridlock because of the bike lanes. They have bad gridlock because there's so few ways to get around Toronto rapidly without using a car so there's tons of people driving; because Uber, Lyft, and food delivery drivers are constantly blocking traffic to do pick ups or drop offs; and because there's tons of construction that's allowed to block off traffic lanes. Of those reasons, I mind construction the least.\nFord and the Tories should take the money they'd spend tearing out the bike lanes and build better inter-city / inter-regional transit so fewer people have to drive into Toronto when they come here for work or fun, and make it easier to get around once they are here so people don't have to either use their cars so much or endlessly calls Ubers and other fake taxis that don't follow the rules of the road and jam it up for everyone else.\n"

        "comment": "Transparency and Standardization\nWhile the transitional provision allowing already-initiated bike lane projects to proceed is beneficial, the proposed legislation would benefit from clearer standards and criteria for approval. Transparent, measurable criteria would aid municipalities in meeting expectations and reduce ambiguity. This clarity would promote consistency in Ministry decisions, allowing municipalities to plan better and reducing potential delays or rejections.\nTherefore Providing municipalities with transparent, measurable criteria for bike lane approval would improve the proposal. Clear standards would aid planning efforts, foster consistency, and reduce potential project delays across the province. Given the need for clear standards to guide municipalities, this proposal should undergo a more thorough review before legislative approval.\n"

        "comment": "The Province should not be interfering in the City of Toronto's decision to build bike infrastructure given that the citizens of Toronto have voted for pro-bike lane councillors and mayors. Not to mention - the bike lanes have already been built, businesses in the areas around them support them, and it will be a waste of taxpayer dollars to rip up newly built infrastructure. Why does the Premier think he knows what's best for Toronto?\nBike lanes provide safe, environmentally friendly infrastructure so that citizens of and visitors to Toronto can get around the city in a fast and efficient way. If you remove bike lanes, it will mean that bikers will need to take up a full lane of traffic, only contributing further to congestion. The data has shown that the addition of bike lanes to Bloor, Yonge and University Avenue has not significantly contributed to congestion - they have actually encouraged more people to bike, instead of relying on cars to get around\nIn the midst of a climate crisis, we need to be building more bike lanes on arterial roads so that biking becomes the first option when trying to get around the city. We only have so much space in the City of Toronto - more space needs to be allocated to other modes of transit so that we encourage people to rely less on cars to get around.\n"

        "comment": "I live in Sunnylea and have witnessed first hand the detrimental impact the bike lanes have had on the Kingsway neighborhood. They were installed with little or faulty data that has never been shared. It is a running joke that the bike lanes are virtually empty all of the time even in the summer. I have sat in traffic for 15 mins and not seen a single bike in either direction.\nNegative impacts include:\n- significant increase in emissions of hundreds or thousands of idling cars every day in traffic. This is ironic as emissions is reason most cited by proponents of bike lanes. Reality is very different than an imaginary world where everyone trades in their car for a bike\n- Uber drivers racing through quiet neighborhood streets to avoid driving on Royal York or Bloor. I have been in Ubers and advised drivers to slow down as they race past kids in the street (there are no sidewalks in this neighborhood). This was never the case before bike lanes.\n- it is a regressive policy. Cycling is largely a  bourgeois pursuit and most cyclists are above average income. They are being prioritized over those that must drive for their job: house cleaners, nannys, delivery drivers etc\n- the aesthetics of the execution are appalling. I have seen bike lanes done beautifully in other cities. Those on Bloor with plastic strips sticking out of concrete blocks makes Bloor street look like a permanent construction site or yard sale. The impact on local business is brutal.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 is a dangerously regressive piece of legislation masquerading as a solution to traffic congestion. In reality, it's an assault on evidence-based urban planning, environmental protection, and local democracy.\nThe provincial government's heavy-handed intervention in municipal bike lane decisions is nothing short of authoritarian overreach. This blatant power grab undermines years of careful local planning, community consultation, and democratic process. It's particularly galling considering that municipalities are legally empowered to make these decisions under the Municipal Act.\nThe Act's fundamental premise - that more car lanes reduce congestion - flies in the face of decades of transportation research. The concept of induced demand isn't merely a theory; it's a proven phenomenon witnessed globally. By ignoring this evidence, the government demonstrates either willful ignorance or deliberate disregard for scientific consensus.\nThe planned removal of Toronto's bike lanes is particularly shortsighted and harmful. These lanes serve thousands daily and have demonstrably boosted local business revenue - facts the government seems determined to ignore. This isn't just bad policy; it's actively harmful to urban communities and local economies.\nThe environmental implications are even more alarming. The reckless exemption of Highway 413 from environmental assessments is an environmental catastrophe waiting to happen. This isn't merely cutting red tape - it's cutting essential safeguards for irreplaceable ecosystems. Once paved over, these vital carbon sinks and natural habitats are lost forever.\nThe timing of this bill, amid a climate crisis and rising urban transportation challenges, is particularly tone-deaf. Instead of embracing modern, sustainable solutions, the government is doubling down on failed 1950s-era car-centric policies that have proven disastrous for cities worldwide.\nThe absence of expert consultation in drafting this bill is glaring. It appears to have been crafted to satisfy political objectives rather than address real transportation needs. The result is a piece of legislation that not only fails to solve congestion but actively works against public health, safety, and environmental protection.\nMost disturbingly, the bill reveals a troubling pattern of governance that prioritizes short-term political gains over long-term public good. It's a direct attack on sustainable urban planning, environmental protection, and municipal autonomy.\nThis isn't just flawed legislation - it's a dangerous step backward that threatens to lock Ontario into unsustainable, unsafe, and inefficient transportation patterns for generations to come. The bill should be scrapped entirely and replaced with evidence-based policies that actually serve the public interest rather than political expediency.\n"

I have biked to work for most of my life here, including my current job where I bike 12km from the west end to downtown. It\u2019s extremely unfair to relegate bike traffic away from major thoroughfares, these routes are direct and right now they are way safer than other bike lanes in the city. It cuts my commute down to take major east-west, north-south routes that are maintained and well traveled. Doug Ford claims that the BRAND NEW bike lanes on University are a hindrance for first responders and Doctors which is in direct conflict with actual response times in city going down year. I would assume that first responders would rather contend with a bike lane then cyclists that have been hit by cars. I strong urge everyone involved to repeal this policy. It\u2019s harmful to so many people.\n"

        "comment": "Prabmeet Sarkaria\nMinister of Transportation\n77 Wellesley St W\nMinister Sarkaria,\nI am writing to express my opposition to Bill 212, the Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024, which includes provisions for the removal of bike lanes on major Toronto streets. As a downtown resident and driver who frequently commutes by car, public transit, cycling and walking, I believe Bill 212\u2019s approach is extremely short-sighted and counterproductive. It risks creating more congestion rather than alleviating it, all while undermining public safety and sustainable, inclusive city planning.\nBike lanes are a valuable part of our city\u2019s infrastructure, supporting a transportation system that accommodates all users\u2014not just drivers. Having the choice to walk, cycle, drive, or take public transit provides me and many others with flexibility and efficiency in navigating our dense urban environment. Removing these lanes would hinder this flexibility and prioritize vehicles over more sustainable, healthier options.\nAs planners from the Ontario Professional Planners Institute (OPPI) have noted (pdf attached), bike lanes are integral to creating safer, healthier, and more connected communities. They support economic activity, improve air quality, mitigate climate change, and encourage active lifestyles, which are increasingly important in urban centres like Toronto. Furthermore, the proposed changes conflict with the 2024 Provincial Planning Statement, which prioritizes the development of accessible, multi-modal transportation networks.\nWhile I recognize the need to reduce congestion, evidence from other cities shows that removing bike lanes does not alleviate traffic\u2014it merely reduces safe travel options for cyclists and pedestrians and ultimately worsens congestion. Downtown Toronto\u2019s roads are limited in space, and removing cycling infrastructure will not increase roadway capacity meaningfully; instead, it risks creating a more chaotic and unsafe environment for all road users.\nI urge the Ministry to work with local planners, residents, and city stakeholders to find solutions that support our entire transportation network, rather than narrowing options. Ontario needs an approach that respects the needs of all its citizens, aligning with the Provincial Planning Statement\u2019s goals for safe, efficient, and multi-modal transportation.\nThank you for your time and consideration.\nSincerely,\nRod M.\n"
