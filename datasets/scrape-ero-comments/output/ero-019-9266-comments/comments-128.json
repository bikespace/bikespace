        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to the province's proposed plan to limit the construction of bike lanes in municipalities across Ontario. This decision is not just shortsighted; it undermines the very foundations of effective urban planning and the pressing need for sustainable transportation solutions.\nEvidence consistently demonstrates that bike lanes contribute significantly to reducing gridlock and greenhouse gas emissions while enhancing overall traffic flow. In a time when many residents are grappling with the rising cost of living, bike lanes are vital for those who rely on affordable transportation options, including delivery drivers and individuals without access to vehicles. Limiting this infrastructure would not only ignore the needs of these residents but also exacerbate existing inequalities in transportation access.\nTraffic congestion is a self-perpetuating problem; more cars lead to more gridlock. Expanding bike lanes offers a viable solution by encouraging alternative modes of transport and alleviating congestion. This is essential for the health and safety of our communities, as well as for combating climate change. The failure to invest in safe and accessible cycling infrastructure demonstrates a lack of vision and leadership in addressing urban challenges.\nClaims that bike lanes hinder emergency response are unfounded. The City of Toronto has stated that emergency services are fully capable of navigating existing cycling infrastructure, debunking the notion that bike lanes contribute to delays. In contrast, restricting bike lanes will directly endanger lives, particularly vulnerable road users, and impede the transformative projects outlined in Toronto's approved plan to add 100 kilometres of bike lanes over the next three years.\nWe need a government that prioritizes evidence-based decision-making rather than succumbing to political pressures that distract from the real issues at hand. The proposed legislation risks not only the progress made in Toronto but also undermines efforts across the province to create affordable and accessible cities.\nI urge you to reconsider this plan and stand for a vision of a city that embraces sustainable transportation options, prioritizing the well-being of its residents and the environment.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is not in the best interests of our communities or even our traffic. Impeding municipalities' ability to make infrastructure decisions regarding bike lanes is no place for our government to be putting up more red tape. Municipalities need to be able to add bike lanes where they are relevant and helpful, which sometimes means reducing lanes to change traffic incentives. This is an insane one-size-fits-all policy that will not help out province.\n"

Why restrict municipalities across Ontario with zero nuance to the decisions.\nThis is a foolish and myopic move by the very ministry tasked with making transportation better. It is embarrassing and you should be embarrassed. I, and many others, have lost all faith that this current government is capable of making one good decision.

        "comment": "I strongly disagree with the removal of bike lanes for several reasons:\n- bike lanes in Toronto should be the City of Toronto's decision. The Ontario government needs to focus on priorities that are in its own jurisdiction\n- bike lanes make cyclists safer, reducing accidents. This makes biking more attractive and encourages cycling. Removal of the bike lanes is dangerous for cyclists - increasing injuries, death and insurance claims (least important, but if you're counting dollars).\n- removal of bike lanes will increase car traffic as cyclists who can no longer safely bike to work will need to resort to driving. Studies show that increasing the availability of bike lanes eases traffic congestion.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 is fundamentally flawed in its intended purpose of bettering transportation options in Ontario. Removing bicycle infrastructure and building highway 413 has serious implications which negatively affect commute times, safety, the economy, congestion, wealth disparity, and the environment. It's almost shocking how little positive impact this bill would have on the residents of Ontario.\nCommute times: Akin to the link between smoking and lung cancer, there is now irrefutable evidence that \"induced demand\" of adding lanes for vehicular traffic is a real phenomenon that has the impact of worsening vehicular congestion over time. The proposed bill 212 will not only increase commute times for cyclists, but also for motorists as traffic worsens.\nSafety: This should go without saying that lack of bicycle infrastructure will increase fatalities for cyclists. A walk along Bloor/Avenue where 3 white bicycle gravestones are visible is a grave reminder of this fact.\nEconomy: There is evidence that removing or prohibiting bike lanes negatively impacts local businesses located along the throughway. As for highway 413, there is limited evidence that the \"improved\" travel times (again refer to the concept of induced demand) will not be worth the cost to taxpayers. The bill also seems to discount the fact that the induced suburban sprawl from the highway will negatively impact greenbelt ecosystems and long-term negative impacts from exclusively building car-dependent suburban communities.\nCongestion: Cars do in fact cause traffic. Congestion is not the result of bicycles (ask beautiful cities like Copenhagen and Amsterdam and Paris how they're doing) but the result of adding more vehicles (ask gird-locked cities like Los Angeles how they've fared from decades of building infrastructure exclusively for cars).\nWealth disparity: Ontario's government needs to be reminded that not everybody is privileged enough to own a car (or comfortably own a car, as many poor families forced to live in non-walkable transit deserts are forced to purchase one). By prioritizing only the wealthiest families in Ontario, bill 212 seems to do its best to exclude affordable transportation options for everybody else.\nEnvironment: This truly goes without saying that prioritizing car-dependent infrastructure in Ontario WILL increase the greenhouse gas footprint per capita. This is contrary to any commitments that Canada has made to decrease its contribution to global warming as already one of the most polluting countries on the planet. It's embarrassing internationally to be having this debate about bike lanes when so many people are suffering from the devastating impacts of climate change and Ontario's government believes that more cars are the solution to problems.\nI will conclude that I would be ashamed to be a resident of Ontario under bill 212. The lack of any foresight or common sense displayed by the government in proposing this bill is astonishing.\n"

        "comment": "As a frequent cyclist in a mid-sized Ontario city, improving our bike lane infrastructure would allow more people to cycle, increasing physical activity and also decreasing congestion on traffic infrastructure. As evidenced by studies on larger, more populous cities (e.g., New York; FLOW, 2016), increasing bike infrastructure allows for significant reductions in traffic. In New York, when bike lanes were installed on a major thoroughfare, there was a 35% decrease in the amount of time cars took to travel through that thoroughfare. If the concern is to \"save people time\" - this is an evidence-based way that will save individuals time.\nFurthermore, we have evidence to indicate that increasing car infrastructure does not ease congestion, but instead increases it due to the principle of induced demand. Simply put - if you build an extra lane, the cars will come (RAND, 2018).  Building extra lanes and building extra highways will not solve problems with congestion in Ontario. Prioritizing non-car, greener forms of transportation will solve problems with congestion, will reduce our carbon emissions and will improve the health and longevity of citizens throughout Ontario. Creating policy that incentivizes municipalities to add bike infrastructure, reduce boundaries to adding that bike structure, and meaningfully collect data about cycling use is critical in our mission to do this.\nLastly, overarching all of this is our current climate crisis. The earth is warming rapidly - all of us have to take action to reduce our carbon footprint. We have a bloated car culture in Ontario, and increasing access to cycling and feasibility of cycling allows us to get around without continuing to add to the climate crisis.\n"

        "comment": "I am a resident of a large city in Ontario, and I regularly drive, bike and take public transit within that city and outside of it. As both a driver and a cyclist, I feel safer and arrive at my destination faster when there are adequate bike lanes along my route. When there are not bike lanes, I am forced to hold up traffic behind me when on my bike, as is my right. When I am driving and there are not bike lanes, I have to wait for safe spots to pass, slowing my journey and that of others behind me. When there are bike lanes, I am able to travel at speed in my car without endangering the lives of the cyclists beside me. When deciding whether to cycle or drive within the city of Toronto, a big part of my decision lies in whether I can take bike lanes the whole way. Municipal governments, who pay for the roads on which these bike lanes are installed, are best equipped to determine where and when they should be installed. This misleadingly-named bill will not reduce gridlock, and it will certainly not save me time. The government of Ontario should do the right thing, follow the evidence, and scrap this bill before it becomes law.\n"

It makes biking safer and if a car thinks it\u2019s too slow to drive, maybe they should try a bike instead. Bike lanes make car use faster and biking safer. Why? Because it protects cyclists and it stops them from going on the road where cars are. With more cyclists in the road it reduces the number of cars. It also reduces the number of cyclists in front of cars slowing down car traffic. This is a lose lose situation and the only people it benefits is people with parking lots.\n"

We arrived in Toronto on August 25th by VIA rail with our bikes. We spent most of the next week easily, quickly, and safely getting around downtown, except where Uber drivers, coffee crowd, delivery trucks, and police vehicles blocked the bike lanes.\nThe Blue Jays won the game we watched, the view from the tower was superb, and the many meals we ate were delicious. Toronto Island, without vehicles, is a national treasure.\nWe also toured other Ontario cities and rural area on the bikes. Beautiful province. But, like so much of Canada, it\u2019s at risk of being strangled and choked (literally and financially) by too many roads, drivers, and private vehicles. No city on the planet has solved its transportation or financial issues with a focus on roads.
