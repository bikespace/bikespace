        "comment": "The initiative to in fact restrict bike lanes raises serious concerns in several areas. From a safety perspective, reducing bike lanes puts cyclists at greater risk by forcing them to share roads with cars, increasing the likelihood of accidents. Economically, bike lanes are beneficial to local businesses, as cyclists are more likely to stop and spend money in nearby shops, boosting foot traffic and revenue. Furthermore, restricting bike lanes disproportionately impacts lower-income residents who rely on cycling as an affordable and accessible means of transportation. Lastly, the provincial government\u2019s decision to impose these restrictions oversteps its jurisdiction, as urban transportation planning is a matter best handled at the municipal level, where local officials have a better understanding of the city\u2019s needs and priorities.\n"

They help reduce traffic, reduce emissions and promote a healthy life style.\nAdditionally, all environmental regulations are necessary and not a cheap badly built highway that ruins the very important green and nature we have.\n"

This proposal appears misaligned with both my safety and my ability to contribute effectively to the province\u2019s success. I respectfully urge the province to reconsider this overreaching and potentially hazardous bill. Instead, I encourage adopting best practices from leading jurisdictions by supporting municipalities in expanding bike lane networks to foster safer, more vibrant cities and communities.\n"

        "comment": "Removing the bike lanes will really force all the cyclists to be on the same lanes with cars which causes real congestion and it is the exact opposite of easing the congestion in the city. This is not only unsafe for cyclists but drivers in the city. We don't always have to drive down the street when it is walking distance for the downtown core. Removing all the lanes will encourage more people to drive because they won't feel safe on the road especially all you have is a helmet unlike a driver they are at least surrounded and protected by a car. Please do not remove the bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "In commute by bicycle most of the year. I also have use of a car and a motorcycle. Several times a week I find myself in dangerous, sometimes life-threatening situations when cycling because car drivers behave recklessly. I cycle because it is by far faster than driving or public transit. The recently introduced bike lanes in Toronto have started to make cycling feel safer and more efficient.\nThe centre of Toronto is growing rapidly, and most proposed and permitted large residential buildings will only feature parking spaces for a small minority of residents. Meanwhile, the TTC is becoming less attractive all the time due to chronic underfunding, and large transit projects are suffering years of delay. Unless these new residents have other options than a vehicle (private or otherwise), gridlock will only get worse.\nFinally, the proposed policy seems to ignore body of evidence supporting that promoting cycling as a viable option for transportation has many benefits for the individual, but even more so for the public. Cycling reduces congestion overall and makes it easier for those who need to drive. People who cycle are on average healthier and more content. Cycling makes youth more independent. In cases where it has been thoroughly studied, cycling tends to increase business along cycling routes. It generally offers a relatively fast and cost-effective alternative for the majority of urban car trips, many of which are under 5 km.\nIgnoring all these effects would be bad governance, and making it harder for municipalities - who tend to have deeper insight to their needs than the Province -  to build biking infrastructure, let alone removing it where already installed, will lead to worse outcomes for the majority of Ontarians, however they get around.\n"

        "comment": "Getting rid of bike lanes pushes people out of the city and makes it harder for them to live in what is already one of the most expensive cities in the world. With this Bill, it's clear Doug Ford only values the opinions of the rich and those who can afford to have a car in Toronto.\nBike lanes benefit me everyday on my commute to work. I feel safer because we have them, and I'm grateful for their presence. We have already seen countless deaths of cyclists this year. That number will go up with the removal of bike lanes.\nThis feels like an emotional vendetta that Ford has against cyclists. I do not support the removal of bike lanes that me, my family and countless other families use to take their kids to school and take themselves to work.\nRemoving bike lanes will make Toronto a worse place to live and it will increase gridlock.\n"

        "comment": "If anything, removing bike lanes will create more traffic with vehicles having to slow down behind cyclists at certain points in roads. Removing bike lanes also makes cycling less accessible, and less accessibility to cycling makes it harder for those who do not drive or do not have accessible public transit to get to their destinations such as work or school. If anything removing bike lanes would provide negative impacts to the environment by using machinery to remove said lanes, causing detours and more time spent on the road by vehicles. All in all, it makes sense to just leave the bike lanes in place. Bike lanes help reduce traffic and create a safe place for cyclists on the road.\n"

Dangerous conditions for those who will inevitable cycle in the city despite removal of bike lanes\n2. Delays for those who do not feel comfortable cycling without bike lanes because they need to take public transport or drive to where they need to be.\n2.5 this encourages the use of gas which is not eco friendly and very far away from what is needed for our earth to survive.\nLeave the bike lanes. Figure something else out to fix and pour money into. I.e mental health funding.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes on major arteries will cause more gridlock and reduce safety for all. Induced demand has shown that removing or adding a lane will not have major impacts to congestion in the long run. Moreso, since the uptick in biking due to better cycling infrastructure, removing bike lanes on major arteries will put bikers in the lanes with cars, causing more congestion and decreasing safety.\nThis idea isn't based on data from any cities that have improved congestion by installing bike lanes on all major throughfares.\n"

        "comment": "I think this is the stupidest thing that has come to pass. Suppose we discuss the city of Toronto. The city, in its entirety, is made of many stop lights for cars and street cars to pass. This itself has an effect on traffic, as the amount of stop lights can influence the speed and flow of traffic. Regardless of this, Toronto is considered a commuter and walkable city. To even think of removing the ability of the MAYOR and the citizens who live there and give it to someone who thinks building new lanes on a highway will help reduce traffic is the most dunderheaded decision ever made. I do not want this.\n"

        "comment": "Premier Ford and Ontario members of the Legislature,\nI am a senior citizen automobile driver living in Niagara Falls, with adult adult child and his family living in Toronto. I personally do not ride a bicycle on even side city streets in Niagara Falls due to a justified concern with sharing even side streets safely with automobiles. I avoid as many car trips as possible and walk to destinations when possible. I am proud of my city of Niagara Falls and the Niagara Region as they have created many bike lanes and paths for the safety of bicycle riders over the last  decade and are planning to increase this initiative.\nBut more importantly the bike lanes are creating a mind set for the current and future generations that bike riding is a better way of moving in the city which doesn't pollute nor add to climate change. Reducing the cars trips that they would otherwise be taking which in turn reduces the need for expensive road building, repair and maintenance. It encourages young families to use this form of leisure and exercise which improves their mental and physical health thereby reducing future health care costs.\nBike riding is a less expensive form of transportation than driving an automobile. Thereby keeping more hard earned dollars in their pockets - to use a familiar quote these days.\nWhile riding mass transit today, I explained to my granddaughter that this subway car alone carried the equivalent of about 20 automobiles full of people. 20 automobiles that would have further congested the street traffic above us. Similarly, all of the bike riders commuting to work, shopping destinations and to schools (secondary, colleges, universities) takes people OUT of their cars and out of mass transit modes to make more room for others, thereby creating capacity in mass transit investments already in use.\nI am continued to be surprised by the number of bikes carried on the front bumper racks of Niagara City and regional buses as riders combine both means of transportation for their trips. Furthermore, the GO-Train service to Niagara Falls has a bike \"rail car' to carry the bikes used by riders that come to Niagara to take advantage of the bike lanes network in the Niagara Peninsula. \"Bicycle tourism\" is a growing field that should continue to grow in the future with INCREASED bike lanes. Look no further than this Ontario Government site- https://www.destinationontario.com/en-ca/articles/top-bicycle-tours-and\u2026.\nThe Toronto Star recently published results from a study indicating how in Toronto routes WITH BIKE LANES increased automobile transit times as compared to transit times before the bike lanes.  A simple Google \"bike lane transit savings\" search produced numerous world wide studies showing the cost savings to a government that values bike lanes. I give three links as a sampling-\nhttps://www.fiafoundation.org/news/protected-bike-lane-networks-save-mo\u2026\nhttps://itdp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Making-the-Economic-Case-fo\u2026\nhttps://drawdown.org/solutions/bicycle-infrastructure\nhttps://www.wri.org/insights/invest-walking-cycling-sustainable-safe-ci\u2026\nOur adult son and his family who live in Toronto regularly use the Danforth Bike lanes to safely travel for work, leisure and appointments. Under the proposed legislation, this is one of the many bike lanes that would be removed. With proper parental guidance, my seven-year-old granddaughter is learning to safely ride her bike with a parent on this busy street using the bike lanes. Building her confidence and safety skills to be a bike rider for life. I would guesstimate that our son's family's bike riding routine saves at least 10 automobiles trips on Toronto streets alone.\nI would appreciate the Ontario government producing the studies that support this currently proposed bill \"reducing gridlock\" by bike lane removal.\nMy thoughts as a Ontario taxpayer support the financial savings to the Ontario Budget by INCREASING bike lanes to reap the provincial government's savings in the areas of health care, mental heath care, road building and maintenance, future reduced climate change expenses and expanded tourist destinations. For these economic and moral reasons as a citizen of Ontario and the world, I urge the government not to pass this bill.\n"

If the Premier wants to be mayor of Toronto so badly, he should resign and run in the next election, and leave being Premier to someone who knows what they are doing.\n"
