        "comment": "As a lifelong cyclist, I urge the Government of Ontario to refrain from limiting municipalities\u2019 power to install safe cycling infrastructure. Instead, the province should work with municipalities to expand safe infrastructure for cyclists, pedestrians, and drivers.\nI live in the west end of Toronto and have been cycling in this city since the 1980s. The Bloor bike lane has had a transformative impact on my commute to and from work. Before it was installed, I used to worry that I wouldn\u2019t make it home to my family at the end of the day, especially in the fall and winter when it\u2019s dark at the end of the workday. When my kids started riding to and from school on their own, I worried for their safety. Now, with the bike lane on Bloor, everyone can travel safely and smoothly. Biking allows me to stay fit and helps me reduce my impact on climate change.\nEvery time I bike along Bloor, as I did today, I feel proud of the progress Toronto has made. Thanks to bike lanes, our city is more inclusive and people have more options for getting around safely. There are so many more people cycling now than there were decades ago when it was more dangerous.\nWhen I drive, I choose routes with bike lanes too. They make traffic flow more predictable and cyclists more visible, keeping everyone safer and reducing the stress of my commute. For example Harbord St, with one of the city\u2019s oldest bike lanes, is also one of the quickest driving routes across the west end.\nBike lanes are better for drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians - and they are better for the environment. They save cyclists\u2019 lives, and also improve air quality which reduces the rate of many serious health conditions and premature deaths.\nThere is no justification for this proposed plan to reduce future bike lanes and remove the ones already in place. Ontario should move forward, not backward.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose Bill 212\nBike lanes are safer for drivers and bicyclists. Bike lanes promote sustainable, healthy transit. They offer an economically viable and beneficial method of transit. On Bloor Street, the Annex BIA supports bike lanes.\nThe provincial government should have nothing to do with a municipal issue like this. It makes Doug Ford seem like a petty tyrant. It is an overreach of provincial jurisdiction.\nI support bike lanes and safe, efficient transit for all citizens. This includes an expanded bike lane system\n"

        "comment": "I live in Etobicoke (own a house) and commute to downtown Toronto daily by bike (and have for the last 18 years). The addition of bike lanes has dramatically increased the number of cyclists in the last 5 years, demonstrating that they work. The only certain way to reduce congestion in the GTA is by reducing the number of cars on the road - there is no evidence, and no example to point to, where more car lanes reduces gridlock.\nThis hold true on the highways - building a new highway far north of the 401 will have almost no impact (certainly less than the cost would require) on traffic flow.\nBetter transit options, better and more extensive bike infrastructure, and proper parking structures.  These are how to keep people moving in the GTA.\n"

        "comment": "No no no. Bill 212 is stupid. I hate this. I am a driver and love having bikes in safe lanes. It makes it easier for me to drive. I live in Bloor West Village. I know drivers and bicyclists. They're the same people!\nWe need bike lanes and we need roads. We can get along just fine without the meddling of a premier who has no idea what he's doing.\nI do not support Bill 212\n"

        "comment": "I absolutely do NOT support this proposal. This change will discourage citizens from making eco friendly choices in the face of a current and worsening climate crisis seen both globally and to a lesser extent in Toronto, with the impacts of recent flooding and air pollution.\nThis change will make roads less safe for cyclists and sidewalks less safe for pedestrians.\nThis expense is not how I want my tax dollars being spent when there are so many more worthwhile investments that could be made to the city and province being left to crumble while Doug Ford guts critical infrastructure, such as healthcare.\nI don't believe an additional lane of traffic is even likely to reduce gridlock proportionately to the detrimental effect this will have on life for cyclists, pedestrians, and the environment.\nAdditionally, this is Doug Ford and the current provincial government meddling in municipal affairs, instead of using taxpayer funded salary to work on improving things on the provincial level per his responsibilities.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose provincial control over municipal bike lanes. Protected bike lanes have proven to significantly improve public safety, reducing injury crashes by up to 40% for all road users, including drivers and pedestrians.\nCities that implement bike lanes experience multiple benefits:\n- Improved traffic flow by giving cyclists designated spaces\n- Reduced healthcare costs through increased physical activity\n- Decreased carbon emissions, as cycling commutes can reduce carbon output by 2,000 pounds annually\n- Enhanced economic activity through increased retail sales and property values\nResearch from New York City demonstrates that bike lanes are a cost-effective public health investment, with just 45.5 miles of bike lanes contributing to an extra year of life at full health for city residents. Additionally, bike lanes make transportation more accessible and affordable for all community members.\nLocal municipalities understand their communities' specific needs and should maintain authority over bike lane implementation to create safer, more sustainable cities for all residents.\n"

        "comment": "In 21st century, with all the accumulated knowledge about urban planning and human behaviors, we should be introducing laws based on exact science and confirmed reports, not by sole prejudice and entitlement protection. Not a single city or developed country has ever abolished safety of one class of citizens (health and environment councius citizenst that care about their own community) to grant pure privilege to another class (car owners get to move a tiny bit faster through neighborhood they do not interact with). This is shameless pandering to privileged people only, and I'm direct conflict with definition of \"good governance\". What is next, removing  trees to lay more asphalt and paving over playgrounds to have more parking space?\nEvery MPP supporting this with vote should get immediate order by province to replace whole front and back yard in their residence with parking space for people that could potentially be passing by in cars and needing parking.\nProvince needs to make sure cities are thriving by alocting fair amount of collected taxes to them and not siphoning off all taxes collected in city to subsidize rural and suburban. Any urban decisions on transportation and zoning should be left to cities themselves.\n"

        "comment": "I am very angry that I even have to waste my time doing this. I use bike lanes every single day to.commute to work. They make my commute safer, faster and more sustainable. They also make everyone else's commute easier too. There is not enough space in our city for every person to travel via metal box to and from work.\nBikes and cycling are a healthy, cost effective and economically beneficial way to travel through our city. They contribute to the culture and vibrancy of city streets.\nThe bike lane should be expanded in Toronto a d must include links across both the Humber and Don rivers. There are not suitable alternatives on side streets due to the road layout of our city.\nPlease leave the bikes lanes as they are and consider them the foundation to a new way of living and working in our city.\n"

        "comment": "I disagree with the purpose of this law for several reasons:\n- Protected bike lanes encourage more people to choose cycling, which reduces car traffic over time and creates safer roads for everyone.\n- It is the government duty to provide infrastructure for all modes of transportation. Limiting this choice will lead to greater congestion, lower mobility, and a heavier reliance on vehicles\u2014outcomes that many in our community are actively trying to avoid.\n- This law seems to be simply ideological, not based on data.\n- Congestion is created by bad urban planning, not because of bike lanes. Creating new surburbs is the cause of congestion.\n- I am opposed to the provincial government (aka big government) overreach in cities business. This goes against most of the Ford promises. I am opposed that bike lanes should be approved by some government employees who doesn't have their boots on the ground. Cities know what is best for them.\nFor all these reasons, I am writing to express my strong opposition to Bill 212.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 is a deeply concerning proposal that threatens to undermine the progress Ontario has made in fostering safer, more sustainable, and fiscally responsible communities. As a concerned citizen, taxpayer, and driver, I feel compelled to express my strong opposition to this bill. I am infuriated about the irresponsible spending of taxpayer money, as well as the inappropriate overreach by the provincial government to add bureaucratic red tape on municipal matters.\nFiscal Responsibility and Avoiding Unnecessary Disruptions:\nDismantling bike lanes would waste taxpayer dollars already invested in their construction. Additionally, the process of removing this infrastructure will create new construction projects, exacerbating traffic congestion\u2014a leading cause of delays in Toronto. It\u2019s crucial to consider the long-term costs and inconvenience this will cause to commuters.\nUnnecessary Red Tape:\nRequiring municipalities to seek provincial approval for new cycling infrastructure adds unnecessary red tape. Local governments understand their communities' needs best and should be empowered to make decisions without provincial overreach. This contradicts the government\u2019s stated goal of reducing bureaucracy.\nFocusing on Key Priorities:\nOntario faces significant challenges in education, healthcare, public transit, and affordable housing. Resources and attention should be directed toward addressing these pressing issues rather than dismantling infrastructure that promotes safety, health, and sustainability.\nBiking Infrastructure: Essential for Climate Action:\nThere are commitments at municipal, provincial, and federal levels to combat climate change. Cycling infrastructure is a critical part of meeting our climate goals by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Removing bike lanes contradicts these commitments and risks reversing the progress we\u2019ve made toward a more sustainable future.\nSafer Roads for All:\nAs a driver, I feel safer knowing there are dedicated bike lanes. They create a clear separation between cyclists and vehicles, reducing potential conflicts and making roads safer for everyone. Removing these lanes increases the risk of accidents and undermines efforts to protect all road users.\nThe City of Toronto\u2019s Vision Zero strategy aims to significantly reduce traffic fatalities. Bike lanes play an integral role in this initiative by protecting cyclists and improving overall traffic safety. Removing these lanes not only jeopardizes this goal but also puts more lives at risk.\nClarifying the Impact on Emergency Services:\nThere is no credible evidence that bike lanes have negatively impacted emergency service response times on major Toronto streets such as Yonge, University, and Bloor. It\u2019s important to base policy decisions on facts rather than unfounded concerns.\nConclusion: Bill 212 risks undoing much of the progress Ontario has made toward safer streets, environmental sustainability, and efficient governance. I urge the government to reconsider this proposal and focus on strengthening active transportation, which benefits all Ontarians. Let\u2019s work together to build a province that prioritizes safety, sustainability, and the well-being of its residents.\n"
