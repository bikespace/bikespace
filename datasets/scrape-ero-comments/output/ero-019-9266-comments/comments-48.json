        "comment": "I am deeply concerned with this proposed legislation, and sincerely hope the government reconsiders it. This is not an exhaustive list, but here are some reasons:\n1. I live near Bloor Street West, and as a pedestrian I feel significantly safer on the street since the bike lanes were installed (all three phases). The bike lanes also make the street feel more community-oriented, improving sidewalk feel.\n2. I am afraid for the safety of bike-riders. I remember before the bike lanes were installed, there were only a few riders along Bloor, but now the bike lanes are congested every morning, with lineups at signalled intersections as numerous as cars. These people have built their lives around the infrastructure, and will likely continue to bike, but this bill will make it more dangerous for them.\nThis has been the deadliest year in Toronto for bike-riders, with 6 people killed, and the people who would be most affected are some out of province\u2019s most vulnerable workers: the gig-economy food delivery riders. I would hope the government would encourage further safety measures, rather than remove them.\n3. I have had the privilege of living in other cities both within and outside Canada, and can attest to how a mature cycling network works to relieve traffic congestion. There are hundreds of studies to support it, but having lived in it, I can tell you that once the network is vast enough to connect to enough amenities, people begin to use it more often, leaving space in the car lanes for those who have fewer options. It\u2019s a win-win, but it requires patience and investment.\n4. It is a waste of my, a humble tax-payer this government pretends to care about, taxes. I am confident that when the government changes, whether that\u2019s in 1,2, or 6 years, that the routes removed will be reinstalled, and we will have paid for their installation twice (and their removal). The whole world is moving towards encouraging active transportation to mitigate climate change, congestion, and obesity, and bike lanes make it safer and more convenient for cyclists and\u2014crucially\u2014to get around their communities. Ontario and Toronto are not unique; this infrastructure is popular worldwide, and road users will and already demand them. I do not understand why this government would waste my taxes on demolishing this crucial infrastructure.\n5. I believe municipal governments should be trusted to make decisions about their road infrastructure without interference from the province. I believe firmly in the intimate democratic process at city halls, and feel that these matters are local ones. The legislation promises to make these decisions more expensive, more prone to unnecessary delays, and I fear, much less likely to be green-lit.\n6. Bike lanes are not the cause of congestion, and removing or limiting serves no benefit! This legislation will invite only more cars to the road, further clogging up the roads which already have capacity issues, and have no room to grow without demolishing the liveability of our neighbourhoods. You cannot solve cars with cars\u2014this province needs to embrace and invest in other transportation modes to reduce congestion, and a mature network of bike lanes are an important piece, alongside well-funded public transit.\nThank you for taking the time to consider my response to this legislation. I am deeply disappointed in the government\u2019s logic in introducing this bill, and hope it will reconsider it before bringing it to a vote.\n"

        "comment": "The Bill proposes to give the province jurisdiction to approve new bicycle lanes. However this would not be effective since most multilane roads in Ontario do not set a meaningful net increase in throughput when the number of lanes is more than 1 in each direction.\nIt is a known fact among traffic engineers that increasing the number of lanes on roads between intersections does not meaningfully increase throughput. Therefore the number of cycling lanes should be increased in order to remove excess road in virtually all cases.\nFurthermore, the scope is way too large to give the authority for approval to all roads to the province. The province should only be concerned with the movement of people between municipalities on roads which have been specifically designed to do so. Bicycle lanes which are designed to cross municipalities should be grade seperated or equipped with a modal filter for safety anyways which does not usually involve removing a road. Municipalities should have the authority to assess and build bike lanes as they see fit without provincial approval in order to promote local initiatives for people to cycle instead of taking the car wherever possible.\nOn the other side of the proposal where the province wants to remove some of the regulations in place which require more approval before highways are built. Historically it has been shown that highways have been built disproportionately through areas of the poor and disadvantaged and at great environmental expense. The premise to build more highways because we need them and that it will reduce gridlock is a flawed premise. Due to induced demand the need to build more lanes will always increase, the only viable alternative to gridlock is to expand public transit. Instead initiatives like mandating public transit access everywhere is what is needed.\n"

        "comment": "The provincial government should devote their energy to other, more worthwhile causes. Facilitating the efficient and timely movement of people through any city requires a multifaceted approach, not a one-size-fits-all mindset. Removing cycling infrastructure will be a net negative: taking away an option that allows an ever growing group of vulnerable road users to travel with some level of security, and forcing them into cars, which will quickly fill up whatever extra \u201cspace\u201d is gained on the road and cause traffic to continue at the same pace it does today.\nIf we aspire to have great cities like London, Paris, New York, or even Vancouver / Montreal, we would be building more bike infrastructure, not removing what we currently have. Even if this setback does occur, it will be a blip - in 50-100 years the amount of cycling infrastructure will dwarf what we have today, not because of some ideological power struggle, but because it just makes sense. This begs the question: why bother even removing it?\n"

That doesn\u2019t include the number of people who left their cars at home and reduced the chance of gridlock. if not them but for the number of lives lost to bad cycling infrastructure, for the people that can longer enter a car alone or even bike because  of a bad cycling accident. please i ask the government of ontario to reconsider this and rethink the bill.\n"

        "comment": "I am strongly against this new ruling, which appears to be political nonsense rather than a plan designed to help reduce traffic. Essentially all research shows that bike lanes and improved alternatives to driving reduce traffic, not adding more roads or lanes. This proposed ruling goes against years of research, so its motivation must stem from some other reason besides what is stated in the verbiage.\nThis also seems like an issue better left to cities rather than ON. Obviously the cycling and traffic considerations of Barrie will differ substantially from those of Toronto.\n"

Bike lanes help me feel safe.\nI\u2019ve started biking to work and to do my errands on weekends because of some great bike lanes in my city. If these bike lanes were removed, I would revert back to driving because I don\u2019t want to get hit by a car during my commute.\nWhen I occasionally DO still drive, I feel more comfortable as a driver when there are bike lanes.

        "comment": "The proposed law is counterproductive and far from achieving its aim of improving traffic, it will only serve to make things worse by removing alternatives to driving. I strongly recommend looking into the concept of \"induced demand.\"\nWith this bill, the province will encourage more drive and discourage those seeking alternative means (such as biking). Studies have show that this will lead to more people driving cars, making traffic worse for everyone. Put another way, bike lanes move more people in smaller spaces while cars are inefficient in comparison, especially if only one or two of the seats are used (as is most common).\nIn addition, bike lanes have been shown to spur economic activity. Business owners often fear bike lanes because they wrongly assess how people access urban shops. More people on bikes means more customers because it is physically easier for someone on a bike to stop and buy something as bikes are easier to park, and they can make repeat small purchases.\nThis bill is also corrosive to the idea of local government making local decisions. The province has the right to set rules for municipalities, but that right should not be used as a cudgel. Municipalities need more tools to solve traffic (especially by helping those who want to to get out of their personal vehicles), not less. This top down imposition ignores evidence and expertise while undermining local planning and basic democratic principles.\nIn effect, the proposed law is a repudiation of evidence. It puts forward a false narrative that is contradicted by many studies over decades. It will make traffic worse and limit municipalities ability to do what is best for them to actually solve these problems in nimble and locally appropriate ways.\n"

        "comment": "It appears this legislation is pushing us in the wrong direction.  Instead of providing infrastructure that encourages people to consider biking or improving public transit investments it will punish people ACTUALLY engaged in the solution (MORE BIKES=LESS CARS).  Bikes are NOT the problem, and dedicating safe lanes for cyclists to travel along major routes does little to no harm to drivers.  The worst gridlock is on highways where bikes are NOT ALLOWED.  Solve that problem BEFORE scapegoating cyclists.\nMany people who cycle give it up as they age but affordable electric assist bikes are extending the cycling life for many enthusiasts.  They also make cycling more attractive to people who just need an extra bit of motivation to take the plunge.  'Thanks' to global warming the biking season is getting longer every year.  With the costs of owning a vehicle going up every year cycling increasingly looks like one of the best transportation options for a new generation.\nFear for one's safety is the main barrier to many people making the transition to a biking-commute lifestyle.  I pass 2 ghost bike memorials on my 17 minute bike to work.  If we provide well-planned inner city commute bike routes there is no reason for cyclists and drivers to be in conflict with each other.  Biking pays dividends that cars never will in terms of carbon footprint and health benefits.  Supporting biking options in every community is the best way forward to promoting a sustainable/livable future.\nProvincial measures and guidelines will never be better at solving gridlock than local municipalities and communities.  Give local governments the power to protect all its citizens, those who bike AND those who drive.  I do both, and I know wherever I live or choose to move, cycling infrastructure is an important consideration.  It is no coincidence that communities that provide these options are well regarded for their liveability.\nSeeing bikes as the problem is short sighted.  It's a punchline to a dumb shock-jock joke.  It's not funny. It's gaslighting AND it won't fix the problem.  Gridlock will still exist, cyclists will still get blamed for it.  We just won't have a safe way to get where we need to go anymore.  Be prepared for more ghost bike memorials in neighbourhoods near you if this legislation passes.\n"

Points 2 and 3, regarding accidents and broadband internet, are not apparent in how they are relevant to this proposal and are independent concerns.

        "comment": "The solution to gridlock is not to build more road capacity or rove bike lanes to allow for more cars. The only thing that causes gridlock is cars. Cities around the world have tried the very experiment this government is proposing and it has failed every time. This government should be looking for ways to provide alternative modes of transportation to the people in the GTA. Heavily invest in mass transit. Fund the existing mass transit better.\nThe only reason people feel that they \"need\" to drive is that alternatives have not been provided. Please stop adding to the problem by creating more capticy for more cars.\nDriving is not a fundamental right. It is a privilege. Access to healthcare is a right.

        "comment": "This is one of the most ridiculous act I have ever witnessed.\nStudies from around the world show bike lanes ease congestion, reduce emissions and are a boon to businesses.  Research shows that's not the case, thanks to something called induced demand. The more traffic lanes that are put in, the more it appeals to people who may not otherwise have chosen to drive, thereby putting more cars on the roads and increasing congestion.\nIn 2016, the European Commission's CIVITAS program published a study examining traffic congestion that looked at several cities around the world.\nFor example, in New York City, the authors shared figures from the city's transportation department that showed in 2010, before bike lanes were installed on a major midtown thoroughfare, it took the average car 4.5 minutes to travel from 96th Street to 77th Street. After the bike lanes were installed, it took just three minutes \u2014 a 35 per cent decrease.\nOntario would be going backwards if this act is passed.\nSide note: urban planning is a city responsibility, not a provincial one. If the province wants to take care about congestion in Ontario, my unpopular opinion no highway should be free. No need to build a tunnel.\n"

        "comment": "I think that the legislation for the province to meddle in the affairs of municipalities is an over-reach. Cities should be the ones who make decisions on whether and where a bike lane is appropriate. It seems that there is always extensive public consultation before any such action is taken.\nAs our populations expand, we need to find more ways for people to get around. For far too long, our society has relied too heavily on cars. On any given day you can look at the cars on the street or on the 401 and see that the vast majority have a single person in the car, the driver. That is a hugely ineffective use of a road\u2019s surface area when compared to the people moved by public transit, bikes, and walking. We need to change the culture to believe in our public transit and other non-automotive options. That\u2019s where we have failed in comparison to other major cities in the world. Canadians like to think of Toronto as a world class city, but the city lacks an extensive transit system when compared to other top cities. One idea is we should make public transit free for students. We need to get our  new generation used to taking transit instead of reflexively reaching for car keys.\nWe have neglected public transit, cycling, and walking as viable options. We need to invest in these other options and not focus on cars. Cars are an ineffective method of relieving traffic. Don\u2019t ignore the data which shows that adding car lanes doesn\u2019t relieve congestion in the long run. It just continues to push the mentality that driving is the only option.\n"
