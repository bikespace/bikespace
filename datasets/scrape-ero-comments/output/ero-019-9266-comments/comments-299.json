        "comment": "I\u2019m a progressive-minded person, with a voting track record to match; in favour of initiatives that will support the climate and public health, but the bike lane addition on Bloor is a poor way of furthering these goals.\nThe addition of Bloor and Yonge bike lanes fails to consider the many trade-offs that come with it, from emergency services, to small business impact, to the sheer ratio of drivers to bikers. These examples will be well enumerated in other comments, but I wish to register a key point this is not a political stand I am taking. It is a principled one. These particular bike lanes were ill-conceived, hurried, justified based on faulty data, with consequences well beyond the good intentions of their originators. We can save the climate without imposing such inconvenience and economic hardship on our citizenry.\n"

I was living in downtown and currently reside in east end and I can tell from the experience as a driver, cyclist, and pedestrian that bike lanes drastically increased my quality of life.\n"

        "comment": "There is no evidence at all to support having this legislation put in place at all. Yonge Street, University Ave and Bloor street are not highways and this proposal is essentially trying to turn them into that based on a whim.\nHowever given the desire to do something to those 3 streets how about this as a proposal:\nBan all street parking on those streets. Why should 4-5 cars parked per block on Bloor W as well as University Ave for example be allowed to take up entire lanes all day? Remove those parking spaces and you will not only instantly reclaim entire lanes but still keep bike lanes in place. It will cost virtually nothing to do that.\n"

I don\u2019t know how long the construction will be to remove these lanes from the key arteries but that traffic will be nothing compared to the traffic caused by pushing cyclists into traffic. Can\u2019t we just ban cycling all together? This is going to cost huge amounts of money and will make traffic must worse. Don\u2019t do it\n"

I can\u2019t think of another reasonable solution if the person is trying to get somewhere on Yonge, Bloor or University.\nI know the conservative government doesn\u2019t care about facts but only feelings, and it has decided to play political games that endanger lives.\nI am a motorist who believes bike lanes should be a continued project across the GTA to improve traffic, get people moving and increase business in the neighbourhood they exist in.\nSincerely,\nThomas\n"

        "comment": "Amen! Finally someone is using common sense to help restore the quality of life in Toronto. Reducing traffic lanes by 33% so that a relative few people can have free space to bike is one of the craziest decisions I have ever seen by a government in my experience in living in 6 major cities in three countries. I urge you to pass this bill.\n"

No further rhetorical explanation is needed because it\u2019s so obvious. Rip the bike lanes out post-haste and terminate everyone who made these ridiculous and wasteful decisions.\n"

        "comment": "Finally some sanity in this whole process. Our family resides within a block Bloor Street West and have so for over 30 years. I have biked for years in the city but would never take Bloor Street even with bike lanes...too many lights. Keep the main arteries for cars and use residential streets for bike lanes. If you want a main east/west artery for bikes, you already have the Martin Goodman trail...the \"401\" of bike lanes. Funnel bikes down to there along residential streets.\nI fully support this proposal.\n"

        "comment": "The three bike lanes in question on University, Bloor, and Yonge are essential to my ability to travel safely around Toronto. I say this as someone who has been hit twice by drivers, and who required five surgeries through multiple years to repair the damage done from the first such incident. In their Oct. 30 letter opposing this legislation [1], 120 physicians and researchers from the University of Toronto highlighted the human cost of our unsafe infrastructure. I do not want to be added to this toll as a consequence of this provincial government's pandering to drivers.\nIf this debate were driven by data, the provincial government would consult the extensive urban planning research that shows bike infrastructure has at most a negligible impact on drivers' travel times. They might consider the Oct. 28 letter from the Ontario Professional Planners Institute [2] stating that the \"proposed legislative changes will not reduce congestion [and] will increase risk to public safety.\" They might consult the Bloor-Annex BIA [3], who have seen that \"bike lanes are good for business, they improve safety for all road users, and reduce congestion.\" Or perhaps they would listen to Toronto Fire Services, whose deputy chief said the Bloor West bike lanes have actually improved emergency response times based on two criteria [4].\nUnfortunately, however, this debate seems to be informed primarily by personal feelings and anecdotes rather than calm, considered study by professionals. So, to that end, allow me to contribute: I feel this legislation is a direct attack on my safety and well-being, and that of the family and friends I care about most. I feel this is transparent politicking to appeal to a political base that lives far from the routes in question. I feel this ignores the extensive study and public consultation that the city pursued for many years prior to establishing this infrastructure. I feel this legislation prioritizes the (perceived, not actual!) momentary convenience of drivers over my safety. Moreover, as someone who has lived and worked in downtown Toronto for ten years, and has lived in the Church-Wellesley neighbourhood for the last eight years, while also driving on a weekly basis, I feel that the bike infrastructure has had no impact on vehicular congestion. Both Yonge and Bloor have been horrifically congested for as long as I've lived in Toronto; far better they have a lane dedicated to cyclists, than they use that lane for cars that are stopped or parked. University, conversely, has so much capacity that traffic flows well, which was true before installation of bike infrastructure and remains true today.\nThe government's foremost responsibility is to provide safe infrastructure, and so on those grounds alone, the bike infrastructure must remain. That safety is worth achieving even if it comes at the cost of convenience for a subset of the population; how fortunate, then, it is that the data demonstrate that this infrastructure does not in fact inconvenience drivers. If the provincial government ignores the voices of the people most directly affected by this proposal in a cheap ploy to distract from the government's failures and engage its base, it will destroy the painstaking progress made by our municipal government in establishing a safe and equitable transportation network, with an immediate and direct impact on my safety and quality of life.\n[1]: https://healthydebate.ca/2024/10/topic/legislation-road-design-safety-t\u2026\n[2]: https://ontarioplanners.ca/OPPIAssets/Documents/Policy-Papers/OPPI-Stat\u2026\n[3]: https://x.com/dmrider/status/1849123389937508607/photo/2\n[4]: https://archive.is/WN2iq#selection-5851.42-5851.159\n"

        "comment": "Please remove these bike lanes. They have made these roads impassable.  It would make more sense to place them on quieter parallel streets, such as Harbord and Poplar Plains Crescent, which are also safer for cyclists to use and don\u2019t have as great an impact on vehicular traffic.  Having them take up an entire lane in each direction on main arteries when they can only be used 6 months a year is completely ridiculous.  It leads to more congestion and pollution as cars idle longer in traffic.\n"

It has many benefits, from reducing traffic and contesting as an alternate means of travel, to increasing health outcomes as a form of exercise.\nBy removing these lanes, more people will turn to cars and flood the streets with additional traffic.\nThis idea does not help with congestion and will possibly make congestion worse, all while taking away a vital means of travel for many people.\n"

        "comment": "I live in the Davisville area (and have for 20 years), and drive on Yonge, University, and Bloor, where the bike lanes exist, on a regular basis, several times a week.\nI have not noticed ANY additional gridlock due to the bike lanes while I'm driving. In fact, I experience the opposite - the traffic flows much more smoothly, with the infrastructure having the intended effect of calming traffic, and making cars drive more predictably. I have witnessed increased safety for cyclists - I used to see many cars drive unsafely past bikes when there were no dedicated lanes. THE BIKE LANES WORK AND IMPROVE OUR CITY.\nRemoving the bike lanes would be a big mistake, not to mention an incredible waste of money and time.\nPlease stop taking this province backwards, and focus on the real issues that need fixing, including health and education.\n"
