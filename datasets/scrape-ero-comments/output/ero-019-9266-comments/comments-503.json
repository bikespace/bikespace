        "comment": "I am strongly opposed to Bill 212, as it threatens to reverse the progress made in creating safer and more accessible cycling infrastructure in Ontario municipalities, including Newmarket and Toronto, where I live and study. As a parent, I am deeply concerned that this bill would limit local governments' ability to make decisions about infrastructure that directly affects the safety and well-being of our children. Safe cycling infrastructure is essential for encouraging healthy habits, reducing traffic congestion, and providing safe routes for families to integrate cycling into their daily routines, such as commuting to school, work, or running errands.\nThe bill also contradicts well-established research showing that bike lanes do not cause traffic congestion. In fact, cycling infrastructure helps reduce gridlock by encouraging more sustainable transportation options, such as cycling, which in turn eases pressure on roads and improves overall traffic flow. Removing cycling lanes will not reduce gridlock or help people reach their destinations faster\u2014it will only limit safe options for active transportation, which are needed for our communities to thrive.\nMunicipalities like Toronto and Newmarket should be empowered to make decisions that reflect the unique needs of their residents, rather than having these decisions dictated at the provincial level. I urge you to reconsider this bill and allow municipalities to maintain control over the development of cycling infrastructure. It is vital for the safety, health, and future of our communities.\n"

        "comment": "Yes, absolutely agree with proposed changes.\nMy family lives in the Bloor and Runnymede area. The new bike lanes created unnecessary gridlock, cars are standing in traffic, producing fumes that people in the neighbouring businesses have to inhale, while the bike lanes are virtually not used. I am sure there is statistics showing these bike lanes are underused, but just a simple observation shows that in about half an hour, one would count a maximum of couple of bicycles passing by and it is primarily the delivery guys who use them, at least in Bloor west village.\nNobody was consulted when these bike lanes were installed, so thank you for consulting people now.\n"

It discourages building more essential transportation infrastructure\n3. We need to think about building a basic standard of safety for more than just cars\n4. It is simpler for drivers if cyclists are separated in their own lanes\n5. Bike lanes support transit by making it easier to get to stations\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 is a threat to road safety to vulnerable road users in the name of being 1) a distraction (or astroturfing if you will) to the nefarious parts of the bill like ability to  create an easement across people's properties property to bring broadband to new areas, highway 314 being except for any environmental impact assessments and no extensions when taking people's land to build the highway 2) ignores all data and studies showing the increased safety when having separated bike lanes not just for cyclists but all road users 3) ignores the fact THERE ARE STREETS WITHOUT BIKE LANES AND HAVE STREET PARKING that suffer the same if not worse congestion (e.g. Dufferin, Dundas, etc) but parking spots on main arteries is good but bike lanes that take up less space is = the cause of all congestion 4) the ministry of transportation is complaining about travel times in the city, as if to compare to his hometown of Brampton when it's two different urban landscapes and there are still traffic lights every block so \"one more lane\" is negligible and 5) clearly being a tactic for securing votes at the risk of safety for human beings who don't have air bags or a hunk of metal to keep them safe. Do you want more deaths on the road, because using this bill for political clout and hidden agendas is beyond reprehensible. Not to mention not fiscally responsible to create more gridlock and wasted dollars to rip out the bike lanes already created for the sake of this agenda.\n"

        "comment": "This is infuriating. How could you possibly think it would be a good idea to remove the solution to gridlock (having less cars on the road and more poeple on bikes)??? That lane will fill up with cars immediately and drivers will in fact NOT \"get to where they need to go\" faster. Instead, for an intelligent and sustainable approach, encourage more people to bike - an effective, ecological and economical solution.\nThis proposal is simply asking for more people to be killed by drivers.\n"

        "comment": "I cannot comprehend what roundabout thinking it takes to presume that removing bike lanes is in any way a solution to any issue this city has. Toronto literally just spent tons of tax payers' dollars - and struggled through many months with a major roadway under construction - to build out the bike lanes on Bloor. And all that work and money did exactly what it was supposed to; Decongested vehicular traffic due to single lane traffic only, made biking a safer option for cyclists, made sidewalks safer for pedestrians, increased foot traffic to local businesses.\nTo do it all again just to remove these lanes is not only idiotic from a tax dollar perspective, it also won't change the issue of overwhelming car traffic. The main reason why traffic is so bad is because the TTC has become completely unreliable. People sometimes find themselves waiting 7-10 minutes for a train during rush hour, 15-20 minutes in the evenings. The green line regularly chugs along at a pace comparable to walking (I genuinely cannot count the times it's taken more than 5 minutes to get from Dundas West to Lansdowne station). There are near constant construction-based closures of stations on the yellow line, and the amount of unforeseen issues and trespassing pauses on the green line seems to be increasing daily. And this is for the transit services that have their own dedicated area! Streetcars and buses are also dealing with the overwhelming road traffic on top of mass reductions in route regularity.\nThis decision would take us so far backward in the effort of making this city not only commutable, but livable. It feels like a thinly veiled attempt to offer a construction contract to some provincial buffoon's buddy, with the hope that more cars means more $100+ parking tickets. It's completely ludicrous, and it must not happen.\n"

        "comment": "Thank you to all who have been involved in formulating and tabling legislation via bill 212 with regards to the dystopian mayhem that has been created via the ill thought out bike lane mess in the city of Toronto.\nAside from the fact that the planning and then poorly designed install of the massive amount of bike lanes in the City of Toronto was done without any regard for due process, finances, or any regard for thoughtful design and much needed analysis, the bike lanes have caused major issues in the City of Toronto that are far too numerous to list. But to name a few things: the lanes are unsafe, poorly designed, present huge risk to all of the users of the roadways and are foundationally responsible for many things that the loons who came up with the plan either failed to or intentionally were unwilling to consider.\nToronto will never be London England or Paris France as one loon who had been a former mayoral candidate had pitched as being part of the genesis of the bike lanes, but be it basic geographically vast differences, the fact is the weather in Toronto is not conducive to year round cycling and even in nicer weather the usage of the lanes is minimal. And Toronto most certainly could never be the Netherlands topographically or otherwise.\nI recently read some of the financial information that can be tied to the implementation of the lanes that have appeared all over the city and just these numbers alone it is appalling to think of how much money the City of Toronto has wasted and those are the numbers that can be quantified. Much harder to try to quantify and tally are the numbers associated to things like: risk to lives via accidents as result of these unsafe lanes, risks to human life due to emergency vehicles being unable to navigate in traffic, health impacts and financial repercussions as result of gridlock and C02 emissions, reputational risks that have been created due to the lunacy of these bike lanes and the economic impacts to businesses that one cannot even begin to analyze and tally.\nMaybe instead of the finger pointing that has gone on by the political loons who have been responsible for this mess maybe they could redirect their deflection to focus on fixing all the issues with the TTC so that people could have a reliable and efficient option for commuting via mass transit within the city. And maybe these same free wheeling spenders could be also be held to account for the mess they have created.\nI fully support the implementation of Bill 212 and applaud the Government of Ontario for stepping in. Toronto is after all the Capital of the Province and the economic hub of the country and if it takes the Government of the Province to step in to correct course; then Bravo.\nPlease ensure that the bike lanes that have been installed on the major roadways in Toronto are removed with haste and please also help ensure via Bill 212 that before any new proposal is made for bike lanes is reviewed and fully vetted by the Provincial Ministry in charge of all things transportation in the Province. If Toronto is to be a world class city it requires sound leadership and judgement and as is now apparent, requires oversight to help ensure that Toronto is a viable place to live and conduct business in.\nThank you\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to voice my opposition to Bill 212, which proposes removing bike lanes across Toronto (some of these were just installed as a welcome addition in the past year or so.) The bike lanes have encouraged cyclists, reducing the number of drivers. I have been able to take bike share bikes downtown in less time than it takes to drive or take the subway.  They  keep nervous cyclists on the road, and make me, as a parent, feel safer about my son biking to school.  Ripping out this valuable infrastructure is a waste of money and will disrupt traffic even more.\nI am also a driver, and I know that when I drive on these main roads in Toronto that now have bike lanes, I feel safer and more secure, knowing that we all have a lane. Driving is safer without lanes appearing and disappearing with parked cars, as they do on roads like mt. Pleasant. It should also be noted that main arteries without bike lanes are just as congested every morning. The answer is not less bike lanes but more. And better public transit, not more lanes.  Please stop undoing the good done in this city.\n"

        "comment": "To whom it may concern:\nThe saying goes that \"The road to Hell is paved with good intentions.\" No doubt, the policy makers behind this bill have the best of intentions. They want to increase the quality of life for daily commuters, to give them valuable time back that they could spend with their families, as well as reduce the stress of a traffic-clogged commute. The sentiment is commendable, but this bill will actually have the opposite effect that it hopes for, if it is allowed to go through.\nThere is a well-known phenomenon called \"induced demand\" (see link 1 - Transportation For America: Induced Demand). Building roads with greater capacity does accommodate greater traffic, but it in equal measure attracts traffic. Drivers will change their habits to flock to the freshly-paved route, which invariably returns to the same congestion as before, if not worse.\nThe best way to alleviate road congestion is to provide viable alternatives to driving. Imagine, for a moment, if the road network was as badly connected as the current bicycle network in Toronto. How many drivers would utilize the roads, if it meant circuitous routes, navigating from side street to side street to get to their destination? Recent justification has been put forth showing low numbers of cyclists vs. the number of drivers as justification to remove bike lanes. However, the opposite is true. Building out a useful interconnected grid of bicycle infrastructure makes a bicycle trip a viable alternative to driving. Less cars on the road means less traffic competing for the space.\nFor support of this, see link 2 - video: The Best Country In The World For Drivers\nBikes aren't the only answer; they are but one pillar of a multi-tiered strategy needed to reduce traffic congestion. Bike trips are great for short distances, quick errands, or last-mile connectivity. The real multiplicative impact comes from combining bikes with public transit. These can take many forms: buses, trams, metro, trains. A bike trip within a few miles of a bus or tram station opens up a vastly larger area of mobility available to a city dweller.\nNot only do bikes and other alternatives to driving offer a solution to congestion, it also makes compelling fiscal sense. Road infrastructure is costly to build and maintain. Resurfacing, adding lanes, and building parking infrastructure costs well into the millions, if not billions. How much revenue do these surfaces generate for the city? What tax revenue does a parking garage generate, compared with an apartment complex with shops at ground level? Roads do bring in traffic from outside the city, yes. However, the consideration of traffic flowing into the city cannot come at the expense of those already living within it.\nRoads take up an enormous amount of space - space that could be used for better things in a dense, vibrant downtown area. Road infrastructure is antithetical to business. The best businesses thrive in places where people want to be, and by and large those places are the most walkable, pedestrian-friendly places. We know this intuitively. No one wants to be next to a noisy highway. Objectively, this can be easily demonstrated by property values along major thoroughfares being highly deflated when compared with their counterparts in quiet neighborhoods. Walkable plazas and pedestrianized streets, lined with business with high foot traffic, experience a boom of patronage and consumer spending. People flock to places that are human-scaled, safe, and enjoyable. This generates tax revenue that directly benefits the city.\nFor support of the economic impact of safe walkable streets, please see link 3 - video: Car-free Streets are Amazing (and we need more of them).\nA superior network of safe, efficient bike lanes would spur business growth and development, not hinder it. Accommodating the car has the opposite effect.\nWhether you look at it from the vantage point of personal freedom (which mode of transportation one chooses to use), health and exercise, community, last mile delivery, aesthetics, less congestion for drivers, reduction to pollution and noise from automobiles, etc., it makes sense to build MORE bicycle infrastructure, not less.\nPlease don't move this regressive bill forward, that would roll back meaningful progress on personal transportation, the fight against climate change, and efforts to make a more human-scale, beautiful, and financially flourishing city.\nThank you heartily for your time and consideration in this matter!\n"

Adding more lanes will not reduce congestion because of the induced demand effect. All it does is make roads more unsafe.\nRegarding Highway 413, this looks like an attempt to lazily circumvent environmental regulations to make the construction as cheap and fast as possible with complete disregard to other consequences.\n"

If that causes a delay then that is acceptable within reasonable bounds. If the assessment shows an environmental impact that affects the required course of the 413 and other construction then good, it's working as it should.\nIn regards to Ministry approval for bicycle lanes required 195.2 \u2014 Bikes in motor vehicle lanes have significantly higher impact on motor vehicle traffic than bikes out of motor vehicle lanes. Mixed use lanes unduly diminish the orderly movement of motor vehicle traffic far more so than separated lanes possibly could. The purpose of roads is move people and goods. It is not to move cars around for their own sake. In the most charitable and optimistic implementation of this section of the best bill it adds needless red tape. By the text of the bill it prioritizes the movement of cars over the movement of people and their freedom to choose how they travel.\n"
