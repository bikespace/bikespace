        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to Bill 212. The proposed amendments pose significant risks to public health and the environment, which I urge the government to carefully reconsider regarding the following reasons.\nBill 212 neglects to prioritize health and safety, as it does not include these terms in the bike lane sections. Prioritizing the \u201corderly movement of motor vehicles\u201d over safe cycling infrastructure increases the likelihood of accidents, injuries, and fatalities for cyclists and pedestrians.\nCycling promotes physical activity, reduces obesity rates, and improves cardiovascular health. Removing or hindering bike lanes undermines these public health benefits, leading to greater healthcare costs over time.\nAn increase in motor vehicle traffic caused by the removal of bike lanes will exacerbate air pollution, negatively affecting those with respiratory conditions like asthma or COPD.\nInstead of enacting Bill 212, I encourage the provincial government to:\nCollaborate with municipalities, health experts, and environmental advocates to create a balanced approach to traffic and safety concerns.\nInvest in expanding connected cycling networks to promote sustainable urban transport.\nAcknowledge the health and environmental benefits of cycling infrastructure as essential for modern, thriving cities.\nInfact Bill 212 undermines public safety, public health, and environmental sustainability. I urge the government to withdraw the bill and instead focus on comprehensive solutions that support all road users.\nBill 212 will not actually eliminate our traffic congestion, but rather will increase our unhealthy conjestion on health.\n"

        "comment": "Automobiles have dedicated space in our right-of-ways and pedestrians have dedicated space. Bicycles, which are not safe for the users in either of those spaces, deserve a dedicated space as well. Bicycle lanes are better for traffic (less cars on the road), for community health (exercise and promoting well-being), and for safety (separating uses). Bicycle lanes provide excellent mobility options when alternatives are unavailable (traffic) or inefficient (driving). Removing already installed bike lanes (ex. in Toronto) or placing a total ban on new bicycle lanes that may affect automobile lanes, without proper studies and data, is not the way to proceed. You are not stuck in traffic, you are traffic. This is an important distinction that we all need to remember and consider. Take public transit, walk, jog, skateboard, or ride a bicycle. Thanks, JW\n"

        "comment": "I don\u2019t think the province should be interfering with municipal decisions about road planning and bike lanes. Municipalities should have the flexibility and authority to plan and build their infrastructure according to the needs of local citizens and businesses.\nThe province\u2019s meddling is not responsive to the needs of many Ontarians. So many of us don\u2019t drive and we want to be able to get around safely in our communities. Our municipal governments can work to make that happen, but not if the province pulls the rug out from under them, or if they have to get approvals on every bike lane decision. That\u2019s just unnecessary red tape. Didn\u2019t this government campaign on promises to reduce red tape?\nIn this case, the province\u2019s intervention is also not grounded in evidence about what actually works to reduce traffic congestion. Removing the bike lanes will just put more cars back on the streets and make travel less safe for cyclists. It won\u2019t speed up driving times.\nAnd lastly, removing three perfectly good bike lanes in Toronto is a colossal waste of taxpayer resources. I\u2019d rather you spent that money on shoring up our healthcare system so emergency departments in rural areas can stay open. Please and thank you.\n"

Removing bike lanes won't do much to improve that, but it will put my and many other cyclists' lives at risk.\nAs a lawyer, the overreach into municipal expertise and jurisdiction is breathtaking. Not to mention the trampling of the will of the people of the City of Toronto and other municipalities. And the waste of money, because certainly when Mr. Ford leaves office, the next provincial government will undo this. And the worsening of climate change as more people choose cars over bikes to get around.\nI am deeply opposed to this bill.\n"

        "comment": "I cannot help but feel this proposed legislation is poorly timed. As a person who has both recreationally cycled and commuted to work via bicycle in Toronto for many years, I can tell you that we have only just begun to feel the benefits of enhancements to the city\u2019s cycle network. It has too often felt like any roads with safe cycling infrastructure will sooner than later lead you on to other roads with limited or nonexistent infrastructure. This amounts to a given journey beginning safely and swiftly, but inevitably being followed by moments of fear, where you are forced to take decisions that are at best risky, and at worst potentially fatal. Some routes have become more connected in recent years, and I truly believe that ridership rates are only just starting to reflect the increased confidence cyclists are feeling as they become aware of these improved connections. With respect to University Avenue\u2019s consideration for removal in particular, the cycling infrastructure has been discontinuous (i.e. ending abruptly at King st., thereby reducing potential demand for the route if wanting to continue quickly to Union station or further to the waterfront) or under construction (along hospital row and around Queens Park Circle) up until the present day. This, in my view makes any short-term statistical assessment of impact on motor vehicle traffic or demand for the cycle path along this route incomplete and therefore misleading. I believe that both our cycling and public transportation networks are modest and would do well with a persistent effort to improve them. If you allow us to build a city with safe, fast alternative means of getting from A to B, congestion will certainly be reduced and the city will feel more vibrant. Cars are one great way of getting around, but they should not be the only way. To add a personal anecdote, I have benefited from having a Bikeshare membership for the past several years, and have loved the valet station at King/Bay West side. This station now often has 300-500 bikes locked in front of the dock by 10am midweek, as the staff work to keep the dock available. This was simply not possible, prior to instituting this system. Previously, 20 or so bikes would have been docked with no capacity for further arrivals. This approach has very clearly incentivized new demand/ridership at a very local level. Let\u2019s expand this thinking.\n"

        "comment": "This whole proposal is such a backwards move on the part of our provincial government.  It is well-documented that adding road or widening roads does NOT reduce gridlock.  It only encourages more people to drive.  We are far behind other developing countries who not only have bike lanes as a normal mode of transportation, but design bike-friendly dwellings so that people can park and leave their bike in such a way as they are encouraged to bike everywhere.  Not only is removing bike lanes going to INCREASE traffic when people cannot use their bikes safely, it is an environmental nightmare.  Less bike lanes is going to create more smog, more noise pollution and more mental health struggles as stress levels rise.  It is well-known (with the exception of the current provincial government, apparently) that exercise and outdoor activities increase well-being and reduce stress and mental health issues.  We are essentially saying that we do not care about the mental health or the environmental health of our city or the people in it if we decide to eradicate bike lanes -- in Toronto and elsewhere.\nIt's deplorable what the Ford government is proposing!\n"

This legislation poses significant risks to Ontario\u2019s environment and public health. The exemption of Highway 413 from the Environmental Assessment Act is alarming. This highway will pave over wetlands, forests, and farmland\u2014essential ecosystems that protect against flooding, support biodiversity, and act as carbon sinks.\nHighway 413 will also increase greenhouse gas emissions, further exacerbating the climate crisis. Transportation is already the largest source of emissions in Ontario, and this project will lock us into decades of higher emissions. Instead, we should focus on solutions like public transit and cycling infrastructure, which reduce emissions and promote sustainable urban growth.\nMoreover, removing bike lanes as proposed under Bill 212 will harm public health by discouraging active transportation. Bike lanes reduce traffic-related air pollution and provide safe, affordable transportation options. The Ontario Medical Association has linked air pollution to thousands of premature deaths annually. We cannot afford to ignore these impacts.\nBill 212 is a step in the wrong direction. I urge you to reconsider and prioritise investments that protect our environment and health while addressing congestion in meaningful ways.\n"

        "comment": "As a tax payer, urban dweller, driver, cyclist, engineer, and construction professional, I am deeply concerned about this reform. Increasing nominal capacity of a road does not equate to a reduction in gridlock. It is absurd to believe that it does. The Minister should know better than use the rhetoric he has been using. Torontonians, and Ontarians, are smart enough to choose the best method of transportation that suits them. This includes public transit, cars, bikes, walks, etc. The government shall provide a safe option to everyone - and that includes bike lanes. Can the Minister imagine if all the cyclists would drive a car? That would not solve the \u201cgridlock\u201d at all. In addition, the dwellers of Pickering do not interfere with Brampton\u2019s urban planning. Why would the Minister want his ministry and the provincial government to interfere at the city level? Why does he not develop Brampton as a business hub and have people commute there?\nI am deeply concerned that people like the Minister, who are allegedly educated and reasonable, would come up with such an initiative. Shame on Ontario if this reform passes.\n"
