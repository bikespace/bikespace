Great expense was put into thorough studies before decisions were made to install them.  And great expense was put into installing them.  How dare the Provincial Government meddle in the affairs of the City of Toronto?  How dare Members of the Legislative Assembly who do not represent the City of Toronto makes decisions about the City of Toronto?\n"

        "comment": "This Bill will sadly mean the end of many lives dn limit the freedom of many others. The lives of children, the lives of parents, daughters, sons, etc. I commute daily on the Bloor bike line from Royal York to St George and then take side streets to reach my work. I see many parents riding with kids in the morning, on add-on seats, or pulley wagons attached to their bikes. I see elderly biking and keeping active. And on my way back around the end of school time I see many parents with kids riding at their heels. Kids on their own small bikes. I've seen many a car try to cut off a kid because they wanted to turn and thought they could beat them only to screech to a stop traumatizing the kid and the parent. I've seen many a car think the elderly person riding in front was going slow enough for them to beat them only to hit them with their fender. I myself now ride with a camera and can sadly say that one drivers see my camera rolling they behave 1000% better. Driver think they won't be held accountable for their reckless driving and endangerment to lives WITH bike lanes on. When there's no physical barrier they park there without consequence, or try to cut you off so they can park. It's sad that how many drivers think twice about their dangerous driving until they see a camera on top of my helmet aimed and filming them. Even then many drivers still don't care about film accountability and still continue to try to run you over. I have had many accidents myself and many close calls, and witnessed countless of other accidents happen a few meters ahead of me.\nRemoving the bike lanes won't reduce car travel times, because the same people who park in bike lanes will now park on a car lane and the same bad drivers leaving larger gaps between the car in front of them because they're on their phone will continue to affect travel times, and the same drivers who don't know the driving rules will still drive however they want. Bad drivers are the ones holding back car travel times today and will continue to be THE problem with more space.\nTaking the bikes lanes will only mean ending the era of parents traveling safely with thie kids to school via bike, or risk their lives, we'll loose some of them, and many more will be injured for life. Same with the elderly, you will limit their freedom to commute and exercise in an affordable way in a city where life had become exponentially more expensive than what they receive as help from the government.\nCyclists will still use the main roads to travel to their destinations, except they will take up the space of a car and be harassed on the road continuously.\nPolice already don't help cyclists that have been hit by cars, so the population who will seek monetary help from the government for a disability will radically increase.\nYou'll spend millions destroying the bike lanes and millions more in medical repercussions and lives lost that could've been avoided.\nTheir bood will be in your hands.\n"

        "comment": "As a Toronto resident who both drives and makes use of cycle lanes in Toronto, I am completely opposed to the removal of bike lane infrastructure in this city. The notion that gridlock will be reduced by removing bike lanes is misguided and dangerous. When I choose to cycle, I want to be able to do so safely and divided bike lanes on Bloor, University and parts of College/Gerrard are a critical part of my planning. Along the portions of College where there is no divided bike lane and I am forced to cycle in the inside lane, sharing that space with motorized vehicles, my very presence contributes to gridlock by slowing automobiles down to allow for my passage. However, I reduce gridlock by not being in yet another vehicle on that street. I do so, mind you, accompanied by significant danger as drivers are increasingly less tolerant of their fellow road users on bicycles. I have had drivers put me in jeopardy on a number of occasions and I have a personal connection to one cyclist who was killed in the last couple of years. On top of this is the massive waste of public funds that is being contemplated for the removal of existing bike lanes. So not only will I be less safe, I will be paying an absurd amount of tax revenue for my increased danger. I will add that, as a driver I feel safer when bikes are in a separated lane since their movements are far more predictable and contained. Bill 212 needs to be voted down in order to save money, protect lives and preserve the liveability of Toronto. Put the Ontario government's priorities where they are needed rather than interfering with the running of municipal politics. We voted in the city government to manage Toronto. That is not what the provincial government was put in place to do.\n"

The city of Toronto has determined how to make it safer for everyone by installing bike lanes, and the province is trying to interfere. Don't waste money ripping up all of the lanes, hope the city determined if there are any lanes that need moving. Senior citizens, those with children will often just stop biking when the lanes go. It is better for health and the environment to have lanes and over $40 million to remove them is such a waste from a government who campaigned on fiscal responsibility.\n"

        "comment": "I am completely opposed to Bill 212.\nI live in downtown Toronto. While I take transit to work (which is near the airport) I use my bike very frequently for both errands and activities in the immediate neighbourhood and downtown. I feel safe and confident knowing that I can use bike lanes to do so, and would feel very reluctant to use my bike if the lanes weren't there. I live close to Bloor St and Dufferin, and both in the morning and evening rush hour see a constant stream of cyclists on the bike paths who are presumably going to work and school. Using my bike frequently means one less car on the road. If everyone who normally biked began driving a car instead, traffic congestion would increase.\nI also live near where Alexis Amaro, a young woman, was killed while riding her bike on Dufferin street. She could have been protected by a bike lane. I am concerned that if bike lanes are removed, there will be more deaths of cyclists.\nBike lanes are being blamed for traffic congestion when other factors are also at play: the Eglinton subway line has not been opened; construction projects block traffic; Uber and Lyft drivers must be on the road to get clients - while there was a cap put on the number of drivers, should there be a further cap on ride share vehicles?\nFor commuters who drive from suburbs to downtown Toronto like the Minister of Transportation, public transit options are available and could be made more available.\nThe removal of bike lanes will cost a great deal and is a waste of money that could be better spent on other provincial responsibilities like education and health care, and improving the public transit system in Toronto.\nThe province removing bike lanes in Toronto is jurisdictional overreach.\nWe are in a climate crisis. More should be done to reduce emissions. Improving the bike lane infrastructure and public transit will encourage less car use, improve air quality, and reduce emissions.\n"

How does this inconvenience created by safe bike lanes compare to the traffic obstruction created by the enormous amount of uncoordinated construction in the city,\nIt is a delight to see parents commuting with their kids to school in safe bike lanes.

Those lanes are often packed at commute times.\nIf you will bully city council into removing lanes, propose a safe alternative route.

        "comment": "As a senior in Toronto I despair at the possibility of going back in time to riding in mixed traffic, dodging car doors and hoping that I\u2019ll make it home in one piece. What manner of idiocy is this, to contemplate removing and restricting bike lanes on our streets?! Bike lanes create a viable option of cycling in the city, safely and efficiently. I\u2019ve used the Bloor Street bike lanes every day this week and used the Yonge Street bike lanes twice this week for medical appointments. It would not be practical to meander back streets to get to my destinations. There are valid reasons for building a bike lane network in Toronto:\n- safe bike lanes promote cycling, which is a healthy, inexpensive and environmentally appropriate mode of transportation;\n- every bike on the road is one less car generating congestion and pollution;\n- government is investing about $60 billion in transit expansion - wonderful! - but one of the key challenges in increasing transit use is getting people to and from the transit stops (first and last mile); cycling is part of the solution;\n- bike lanes are part of the solution, not the problem! Traffic congestion is caused by many things, but primarily by construction activity and bad behaviour where intersections are obstructed. Support people on bikes and reduce congestion, reduce health care costs, help children, students, people with low incomes have a way to get around;\n- there are good things about city living but also many negatives, like noise, congestion, and sheer intensity; bike lanes, like attractive streets and parks and interesting cultural events, are essential to having a quality of life in the city that continues to sustain and grow the population and economy; if life in Toronto shifts to unbearable, what happens to the economic engine of the province?\nAny decision should be based on data, consultation and open consideration of options. The bike lane proposals in Bill 212 aren\u2019t informed by these things, and seem to be simply dogma - Premier Ford\u2019s disdain for cycling and need to continually poke the City of Toronto in the eye. This is not responsible governing and I\u2019d ask that the Province not approve the bike lane provisions of Bill 212. The City of Toronto is in a much better position to understand and act on the needs and preferences of its citizens. If fixing traffic congestion is really the issue, how about getting the Eglinton Crosstown running? How about supporting the City in managing the incredible amount of construction activity in our vibrant city, including all the construction associated with provincial projects? How about opening up Highway 407 to truck traffic and perhaps cars?\nPlease be thoughtful and responsible and drop this poorly conceived idea of regulating bike lanes. Thank you\n"

I am worried that by removing the Bloor bike lane, Bill 212\u2014The Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act\u2014will hurt my business. Minister Sarkaria\u2019s statements that bike lanes are bad for small businesses just aren\u2019t true. The Bloor bike lane is part of what makes my business work.\nFew of my customers drive. As a cocktail bar, my customers often need an alternative to driving. The Bloor bike lanes offer that. I would say a third of my customers use the Bloor bike lanes. I can\u2019t afford to lose that business, and it is not realistic that these customers would be replaced by motorists.\nMy business also relies on delivery services. Since the bike lanes have been installed, delivery services have changed dramatically. Nearly all deliveries to my customers are now made by electric bicycles. It is inconceivable that these deliveries could be made as well by drivers as they are by cyclists. Without bike lanes, delivering to my customers will be slower, more dangerous, and less reliable.\nWe participate in the Caf\u00e9TO program and have a small patio located on the Bloor Street sidewalk. The bike lane buffers our patio from passing traffic, making it a pleasant place to sit and talk. I doubt the patio would attract many customers for happy hour if they had to sit immediately next to rush hour traffic. Because of the bike lane, my business has literally been able to expand, onto the sidewalk and into the community.\nMy customers bike to my bar. My employees bike to work and so do I. Small businesses like mine do better when thoroughfares like Bloor Street are safe and orderly. Bike lanes help provide that. Please, rethink Bill 212 and leave the Bloor bike lane where it is.\n"

        "comment": "You were not given a mandate to usurp the decisions made by elected officials at city hall. To do so is to rob your own constituents of their democratic rights.\nForcing cyclists onto side streets that are 1/2 the width as major roads is no solution.  Consider that these side-streets have fewer controlled intersections or crosswalks, yet still have moving vehicles, parked cars, garbage trucks and the like\u2026all squeezed together.  Additionally, those cyclists still need to get to the main streets as they are shopping at the same stores as cars.\nAround the world cities have found that the only way to deal with congestion is giving people options to NOT take their car.  The answer lies in cycling, walking, transit, car pools, tolls, etc, not a bias towards cars.\nDo your supporters realize that many of these cyclists will go back to driving cars?\nThe province has fuelled a building boom through higher density zoning.  The density necessitates that these not be car centric communities.  Transit helps but it\u2019s insufficient on its on.  So what\u2019s your plan?? The talk in our community is that you haven\u2019t thought these two initiatives through (high density communities/prioritizing cars).\nIf you really plan on doing this, make the new found lanes on major roads a diamond lane \u2014 dedicated during rush hour to bus, bike, and taxis.\n"

I feel it benefits the environment, my own health, and lowers the amount of cars on the road. I often stop and talk to other cyclists and pedestrians, which brings me a sense of community.\nI feel safer riding on streets with protected bike lanes, and I use them often. Sometimes every day. I frequently use the Bloor, Yonge and University lanes as well as many others. I access health care at Toronto General Hospital. My dentist is on University Ave. I also frequent shops and restaurants along these routes, which is something I didn't do before the bike lanes were installed, for safety reasons.\nI firmly believe that the bike lanes reduce congestion in the city. In the coming years Toronto will be experiencing a large growth in population, and the roads cannot handle hundreds of thousands of more cars. Alternate means of transportation are the only thing that will solve congestion.\nThe province should be focused on improving public transit, so people will be inclined to use it. Pedestrian and cycling safety will encourage more people to leave the car at home.\nPlease do not remove any of the bike lanes. They are part of the solution, not the problem.\nThe city of Toronto has a transportation plan based on research and evidence, that is moving us toward safer, more beautiful streets that are useable by everyone. Streets that are not perpetually jammed with cars. Adding another lane for cars just makes a one lane traffic jam into a two lane traffic jam.\nLet the city manage its own transportation, at a municipal level. That's want I want as a citizen of Toronto.\n"

Different alternatives to driving should be viable for those who do not want to use a car or can't use a car. Driving cars is not only more dangerous to people's lives, but it is a major financial burden to bear, especially to those who are already struggling to afford living costs in this city.\nIf you want less traffic congestion to \"get drivers where they need to go faster,\" making it more feasible for people to bike will get more cars off the road and reduce car traffic. Improving bike-friendly infrastructure and adding more bike lanes will encourage more people to bike instead of drive, and bikes take up far less space on the road than cars do. As long as there are adequate bike lanes, then cyclists will not be in the way of people who drive cars.\nIn the advent of our current climate crisis, it is very important that we take measures to mitigate it by encouraging people to take alternative and environmentally friendly modes of transportation, such as biking.\n"

Because of the bike lanes on Bloor, we are able to bike to her activities, to go to the movies, and get to her friend\u2019s house. We choose to bike instead of drive. It\u2019s better for our health, better for the world. Eliminating these lanes will add our car to the road and prevent my daughter from getting needed exercise. It\u2019s simply not safe for children to bike in the city without bike lanes. This bill actively hurts the health of children in Toronto and prevent them riding bikes safely.\nIn addition, this bill does not have the appropriate research to back claims made that the bike lanes are causing delays. Construction is FAR more disruptive. On university avenue, no driving lanes have been affected by installing safe bike lanes. They are only blocked by construction. I insist that proper research be completed to fully understand the cost and impacts of any bike lane removal. This is vital infrastructure that should not be removed in a personal opinion. Let\u2019s take our time to evaluate and understand and make smart informed choices.\n***Our city streets like Bloor should prioritize community, not commuting. ***\nAnd remember, if there are no bike lanes, cyclists have the right to take up a full car lane. Which we will. I imagine that will be more disruptive to traffic. We may be expected to ride 1 meter from the curb, but we can take up the full lane if we feel we need to do so for safety. Well, I don\u2019t feel safe without a bike lane. If this government won\u2019t act as expected by conducting proper research and consulting the public, cyclists will follow your lead, and won\u2019t act as expected either.\n"
