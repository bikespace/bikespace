Cyclist deaths are at an all time high and bike use not only is good for the environment but in and of itself LOWERS road congestion as a bike per person is smaller than the car per person in a lane. To destroy existing infrastructure is preposterous and makes bike riding more dangerous putting Ontarian lives at risk.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212, in which the Province co-opts municipal powers and processes for the approval of bike lanes, is a regressive measure, an unwarranted intrusion. A superior body of protocols and expertise already exist for deciding granular, low level issues; they're called municipal politicians, planners and staff. Let them do their job; let them do what they've been voted in to do, whether that's the installation or removal of bike lanes.\nSo there is no need to insert red tape, expense and complication when locals seek to improve their neighbourhoods. Municipal property taxes pay for local streets and it makes sense that's where the power to decide the disposition of those streets should remain, with alderman, councillors, mayors, local citizens and businesses--they're the best qualified to know. A remote, uninformed bureaucracy is not required or appreciated for such matters. What next, provincial approval for installing crosswalks, stop signs and speed humps too?\nSigned,\nMiddle aged citizen of Toronto\n"

        "comment": "I believe the province is over stepping into municipalities discretion and decision making powers. Reducing bike lanes will not reduce traffic. Bike lanes have helped with the flow of traffic- having designated space ensures that everyone is getting to where they need to go in an efficient manner. Maybe reducing parking during rush hours on main roads would be a better option.  The government should be looking at the levels of construction in all areas of municipalities and how this reduces traffic times, and ensure that construction projects are being done with efficiency and within the designated timeframe. In addition, I'm concerned of the numbers of fatalities and injuries that will occur due to a reduced amount of bike lanes on main roads. It's a dangerous decision to make, and there will blood on the hands of the province.\nIn a time of a climate crisis, the amount of people who are taken to riding their bike to work rather than taking the care is such a huge and positive step! I'm unsure why the government wants to encourage people to use cars for travel, and discourage people from riding their bikes.\nFinally, these feels like a waste of time. The government could be using their energy and tax money to increase services for communities that are facing crisis with housing and health care. Why are you focused on bike lanes when there are so many other issues to worry about?\n"

        "comment": "Dear Ontario Government\nI hope you consider the people who are on bikes and bikes as an option for the city then this bill is one of the worst pieces of legislation ever. There is currently a faint network of bike lanes that allow biking to be safe in our city and removing the bike lanes and not adding or limiting new ones will make my bike commute no longer viable. I work at three places requiring me to commute via bike, all three of which are on Bloor Street and Yonge Street. By preventing me from my bike by removing these lanes you remove the option for me to bike to work safely. I hope I don't show up as the next road accident on the street because of this plan you are implementing. But I don't know maybe there will be 7 cyclist deaths this year and if there are I hope you take responsibility for that. I also want to comment that businesses greatly benefit from bike lanes, all the places I work on those streets with bike lanes or near to bike lanes as had an increase in business. I have a lot of clients that come to my workplace via bike, and my workplace will incur severe losses because of your plan and I hope you will compensate for that if you go forward with this plan. Lastly, I want to comment that your plan will not fix traffic congestion, instead of bike traffic, all of those people will overcrowd the subway on Line 2 and Line 1 and overcrowd the streets with their cars. The space efficiency of cars is not useful to fix traffic congestion on the streets, the one lane for cars you will get back via this plan will just be filled once again because now you are not giving option for people to use their space efficient bike instead. In addition, drivers now thinking that the road is not congested will use the road (concept of induced demand) and fill up the road back to the congested levels they had before or even worse. It is like the same story is repeated over and over again and I hope that you will realize the error of your ways with this plan. I also think that this is a waste of taxpayer money, instead of bringing us actual solutions to traffic congestion, the Provincial government of all people is messing and destroying our road for cheap political gain from drivers when it won't even benefit drivers at all frankly.\nIn conclusion, Dear Provincial government stay out of Toronoto's local politics and frankly buzz off, and if you go forward with this plan, I will not vote for you. For the reasons I mentioned above this plan will not help anybody and frankly, it is a message to commuters in the city no matter what mode that you will always arrive late to your appointments. The Car is too slow and inefficient to drive around, The bike is not safe to ride on, and the TTC is too expensive and incurs frequent stoppages to be a serious alternative to anything. With this message, you are telling Torontonians to either get into a car (slow as it may be) or take a walk because there are literally no other viable means to get around\n"

        "comment": "I cycle and I own a car. I bike as often as possible because it\u2019s often just as fast as driving, I don\u2019t contribute to gridlock, and biking lessens carbon emissions. Toronto needs more transit to reduce gridlock, not more lanes for cars. The construction to remove the bikes lanes will be awful. Bike lanes are a bare minimum for cycling safety as well, which is important as there are cycling deaths every year.\nForward thinking cities the world over have bikes lanes and infrastructure for cycling. This bill will move us backwards.\n"

The number of commuter cyclists on my way to work  has been steadily increasing every year for the past decade, and I have no doubt this is largely due to the improvements and creation of safer cycling infrastructure in my community. If only a fraction of the public dollars spent on roadways and insane ideas like tunneling under the 401 were spent on giving citizens  alternative options to sitting in their cars, I would be more inclined to believe that this government is actually interested in improving the quality of life of the people of Ontario. People never look as happy in their cars as the do on their bikes.\n"

        "comment": "I oppose this Bill for three major reasons:\n1. Reducing bike lanes will not reduce gridlock. In fact, it will increase the number of cars on the road and increase gridlock further.\n2. Reducing bike lanes will increase greenhouse gases, negatively affecting our environment. We are in a climate emergency and cars are main contributor to it.\n3. This act is an attack on the ability of municipal governments to develop their own visions of what their municipality should look like. What is the point of having democratically elected officials at the local level if they enact their own policies. Provincial governments are quick to respond if they feel the federal government is infringing on their areas of jurisdiction.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed provincial plan to restrict the development of bike lanes in Ontario\u2019s municipalities. This approach is not only shortsighted but also undermines effective urban planning and the urgent need for sustainable transportation options.\nResearch consistently shows that bike lanes play a key role in reducing gridlock, cutting greenhouse gas emissions, and improving overall traffic flow. In a time when many people are facing rising living costs, bike lanes provide affordable transportation for those who rely on them. Limiting bike lane infrastructure ignores the needs of these residents and worsens existing disparities in transportation access.\nTraffic congestion only compounds itself\u2014more cars lead to more gridlock. Expanding bike lanes provides a practical solution by promoting alternative transit options and relieving congestion, which is vital for community health, safety, and climate change efforts. A failure to invest in safe, accessible cycling infrastructure reflects a lack of foresight and leadership in tackling urban challenges.\nConcerns that bike lanes hinder emergency response lack evidence. The City of Toronto has confirmed that emergency services are able to navigate current cycling infrastructure, countering claims that bike lanes cause delays. By restricting bike lanes, we put vulnerable road users at greater risk and disrupt Toronto\u2019s approved plan to add 100 kilometers of bike lanes over the next three years.\nOur government should prioritize evidence-based decisions over political distractions that ignore real issues. This proposed legislation not only threatens Toronto\u2019s progress but also undermines broader efforts to make our cities more accessible and affordable across Ontario.\nFurthermore, this matter falls within municipal jurisdiction, and provincial intervention here represents a severe overreach.\nAs citizens, we demand you to reconsider this proposal and support a vision of cities that prioritize sustainable transportation, resident well-being, and environmental responsibility, within the purview of provincial decision making.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is a terrible idea. The urban planners already look at the data to ensure a bike lane is a good fit. Please don't additional red tape to the creation of bike lanes. I live in Ottawa and the way I beat traffic congestion on my commute is to bike to my office. Bike lanes make my commute safer and are essential to an efficient transportation network. Congestion is eased with alternative options to the car, such as transit and bikes. The province should support these alternative options with funding and less red tape.\nMy children regularly use bike lanes to get to and from their activities. For my family, good bike lanes mean we don't have to drive to an activity as the kids can safely get there without a parent driving them. Bike lanes also enhance the safety of pedestrians.\n"

You want to reduce gridlock by putting people's safety at risk, this is ridiculous. This is not going to reduce gridlock, there is too many people using their personal vehicle for the amount of road space you have a available. Gridlock is an issue on highways... where there are no bike lanes, gridlock has been an issue since before bike lanes. You need to get people out of their vehicles and into other forms of transportation. Like active transportation and public transit, if you actually hope to reduce gridlock.\nCities do consultations with the public before they implement plans for their city. Therefore if cycle lanes are in the plans is it because the public wanted them there. Stop trying to overthrow the democratic process.\nI will not be voting conservative in the next election.\n"

        "comment": "The proposed framework requiring provincial approval for bike lanes contradicts established environmental protection principles, including the Environmental Bill of Rights' fundamental right to a healthful environment. Urban environmental health\u2014which directly impacts human wellbeing through air quality, noise levels, and opportunities for active transportation\u2014must be protected through evidence-based local decision-making, not hindered by additional bureaucratic barriers.\nBike lanes play a crucial role in reducing environmental impacts in urban areas. They contribute to decreased air pollution by encouraging mode shifts away from vehicles, lower noise pollution levels in neighborhoods, and reduce harmful stormwater runoff containing tire particles, microplastics, brake dust, and road salt. These environmental benefits are well-documented and align with provincial sustainability goals and environmental protection mandates.\nThe framework creates an asymmetric burden of proof that unfairly targets sustainable transportation infrastructure. While municipalities would need to justify bike lanes with extensive data collection, no similar requirements exist for maintaining or expanding car infrastructure\u2014despite clear evidence that increased car lanes lead to induced demand and greater environmental impacts. This imbalanced approach undermines municipal efforts to develop integrated transportation networks that could effectively reduce both congestion and environmental degradation.\nBy adding provincial oversight to municipal bike lane decisions, this framework would impede local governments' ability to respond quickly to environmental challenges and community needs. Municipalities are best positioned to understand their local environmental conditions and implement appropriate solutions. Rather than creating additional barriers to sustainable infrastructure, provincial policy should support municipalities in their efforts to build environmentally responsible transportation networks that align with both local and provincial environmental protection goals.\n"
