Every study by any reputable person in this field has come to the consensus the best way to reduce traffic is to increase the desire and usefulness of other modes of transportation (ie public transport , bikes, etc...)\nIf this bill passes I intend to do as much as possible to explain and convince all my friends and family to never vote conservative again. This bill along with others in the past prove how little your government cares about doing the smart intelligent thing.\n"

        "comment": "I live in west end of Downtown Toronto and go into the office everyday. As more office workers are moving to back to in office work, commuting experience will become more important. My options right now are a 17 minute bike ride, 28 minute Uber ride, or 33 minute TTC ride (includes streetcar and Line 1 Subway down University). The cheapest and quickest option is to bike to work. The safest North-South bike route between my office and home is through University Avenue. With the new bike lanes, my bike commute to/from work has been MUCH safer and more convenient. Cycling in toronto has not felt safe in the past, and over the last few years since covid, after more bike lanes were installed, my sense of safety while bike has improved significantly! I've heard so many horror stories from friends and colleagues who have gotten into accidents while biking in Toronto, usually because a car is turning and did not watch for cyclists because they don't expect them to be there. This is a huge issue when there are no DEDICATED bike lanes on the roads. Cars do NOT look for cyclists, and they just turn as soon as they see an opening between other cars, rather than scanning for cars, cyclists, and pedestrians. Adding the extra lane of dedicated bike lane puts us cyclists in a safer space for drivers to actually look for cyclists. Without the bike lanes, our safety is significantly at risk. My commute time will be significantly increased if I cannot bike to work, and if I continue to bike to work, my safety will be at risk without the bike lanes on University. Bike lanes create a better safe environment for all, as car drivers will pay more attention to their surroundings when turning and lane changing, keeping a closer eye on pedestrian and other cars in addition to cyclists. We cannot remove this essential safety feature of a bike lane along major roads such as University, it will put the safety of pedestrians, drivers, and cyclists at risk. I can only speak on University from my personal experience since I use it daily, but I know all bike lanes in the City are essential to the safety of the neighbourhood.\nPlease keep the existing bike lanes and make it easier for the City to add more bike lanes for the safety of everyone! Too many people have died from accidents with cars while biking, we cannot go back to a less safe environment when the City is already becoming an unsafe place.\n"

        "comment": "I am against Ontario Bill 212 (Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024) for several critical reasons. The proposal to remove bike lanes as a means of reducing traffic congestion is fundamentally flawed and unsupported by evidence. In fact, removing bike lanes will not reduce traffic; studies and historical data have shown the opposite. This measure will likely lead to more accidents and fatalities, ultimately costing the city more in healthcare, emergency services, and legal expenses.\nHistorical data from Toronto highlights this issue clearly. When bike lanes were removed from Jarvis Street in 2011, the city\u2019s own data indicated that travel times increased and traffic slowed, contradicting the intended outcome of easing congestion. Removing bike lanes only serves to endanger cyclists and deter sustainable transportation options, leading to higher reliance on cars and exacerbating gridlock.\nInstead of pursuing policies that endanger lives and diminish the quality of urban infrastructure, the province should focus on investments that directly benefit residents, such as enhancing healthcare and education. This approach would serve the long-term interests of Ontarians far better than dismantling bike lanes to placate drivers and suburban commuters.\nIn summary, Bill 212 is a step backward for Toronto and the province as a whole. Sustainable urban planning should prioritize multimodal transportation solutions that promote safety, efficiency, and environmental responsibility. The government\u2019s focus should be on creating a livable, accessible city for everyone, not just accommodating those who drive into the city for work.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is the stupidest, most short-sighted proposal from a monumentally stupid and short-sighted government. There are mountains of well-researched evidence that bike lanes are not a significant contributor to congestion in Toronto. Moreover, it has been equally proven that increasing road capacity worsens congestion in most cases. The only thing removing bike lanes will do is increase the danger and eventually the harm to cyclists and pedestrians. There will be no reduction in gridlock. The premier should keep his nose out of municipal affairs. There's enough going wrong at the provincial level that he could be attending to instead. Stay in your lane, Mr. Premier!\n"

        "comment": "The proposal will not in fact save anyone time. All modern cities have bike infrastructure. Data available from cities Toronto would like to emulate proves that safe biking infrastructure is critical to human safety, efficient movement of goods and people, and reducing gridlock. Removing established lanes that are serving people, to make space for lanes for parking/auto users who do not pay for upkeep/repair is a future lesson in bad policy. Minister Surma recently took a trip to Japan and raved about the state of their streets and infrastructure; the lesson should be to emulate the world's largest city who less than 5% of its 42M resident population drives. If Ontario Line and other transit projects are going to succeed going forward on transit and bike infrastructure vs back on laneless bloor street is the way this city and province needs to go. It is a shame this government has failed to put human lives and a strong economy first and is instead continuing on a path of foolhardy rhetoric.\n"

I have no other way to get there. I would do just about anything to not have to drive. I am waiting on Metrolinx to build the GO stations they announced years ago, but haven't event started yet. I'm waiting on the City to install more bikelanes in Etobicoke/Rexdale, so that I can cycle safely. While I wait, I spend thousands a year on my car, insurance, gas, wear/tear, and the stiffness that results in my body from driving.\nI do not want to HAVE TO spend thousands of dollars on a car because alternative means of transit are neglected. The Province's priorities are making my life harder. The Province's priorities take money out of my pocket. The pause on gas tax is hardly a dent - if I could get to work some other way, now that would make a huge impact on my wallet.\nPlease, I'm tired of this silliness from the Province. It's exhausting. Build things instead of engaging in these silly battles.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is ludacris for so many reasons and is a gross overstepping of established roles and responsibilities between the Province and City. The Province should not be dictating how a local municipality allocates road space, especially for vulnerable users. Additionally, there is no evidence that would speak to your proposals to remove bike lanes actually doing anything other than further increasing congestion. If you want to help reduce gridlock, then you should be prioritizing congestion charges and tolls on the Gardiner and DVP to reduce incoming traffic volumes and shift people to use GO Transit.\nFurther, your nonsensical approach will get people seriously injured or killed as cyclists and pedestrians will be losing out on much needed infrastructure protections. Your suggestion for bike lanes to be on secondary streets is asinine and speaks to how incompetent the current Minister of Transportation is that he does not have an understanding of basic mobility. People want to bike on Bloor and University Ave because that's where the destinations are that they are going to. All of these roads have subways underneath them and people should not expect to be driving on them like a highway. If you want to move quickly then park your car and get on the subway as hundreds of thousands of Torontonians do daily.\n"

Other parts on the city where cyclist have to share the lane with cars sees cyclists on sidewalks more making it dangerous for pedestrians, has them ignoring traffic lights which makes it dangerous for pedestrians and cars at intersections, and means the chances of a collision happening higher which is dangerous for everyone. People lives will be put at risk. It is a waste of tax prayer\u2019s money from all around the province to tear the bike lanes out that make this city safer and faster for drivers and cyclists. It is irresponsible of tax prayer\u2019s trust in the government to improve our cities and lives. Do not remove the bike lanes. People do not want it and are letting it be know.

        "comment": "As a resident of a large municipality in Ontario, a vehicle driver, cyclist and pedestrian I understand the challenges in balancing the needs of all road users to achieve efficient and timely flow of traffic.  Unfortunately Bill 212 will do nothing to solve the grid lock problems in the major cities of Ontario, no matter how it is titled.\nBill 212 simply reinforces motor vehicles as the priority for transportation in and around our cities and puts cyclists and other active road and infrastructure users as second-class citizens.\nBill 212 flies in the face of well founded research and studies that demonstrate that increasing the number of lanes for motor vehicles does nothing to ease congestion. Bike lanes are not the problem, but for some reason the Ford government has decided to make cyclists their scapegoat.\nOnly providing safe and efficient alternatives to taking a motor vehicle reduces that congestion - be it public transit, active transportation infrastructure (such as dedicated/segregated bike lanes) or pedestrian walkways.  It should be obvious, and a priority, given Ontario's ever increasing emissions problem that providing alternatives to motor vehicles is what is needed.\nBill 212 will worsen the quality of life for city dwellers due to increased congestion, increased pollution from vehicle exhaust and will further increase medical costs for the province due to illnesses caused by air pollution and reduction of active transportation options for people to be outside, be active and enjoy healthy living.\nBill 212 only serves to reinforce the already existing isolation of people from their cities by putting the priority on motor vehicles.\nBill 212 will increase the number of incidents of cyclists being injured or killed by motor vehicles by removing formerly safe cycling infrastructure and forcing them back onto roadways where they are highly vulnerable.\nThe province should not, must not, be reaching so deeply into the decision making process of municipalities.  This is more government over-reach and interference, not less.  The government promised less government when elected.  This is a very long-handled screwdriver, so to speak.\nBill 212 is a study of deep over-reach by the provincial government into municipal affairs and is not good governance. It will not solve the grid lock problem but it will hurt cyclists and other active road users for no reason.  It is a mean-spirited and cynical swipe at a whole demographic of Ontario citizens.  Bill 212 should be deleted.\n"
