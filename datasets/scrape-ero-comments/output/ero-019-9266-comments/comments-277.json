Although it may be legal, it should not be within the province's purview to control how municipalities allocate space on their streets.\nRegarding Highway 413, this proposal overrides sound planning practice and is little more than an effort to reward land speculation along its corridor.\nThe province should focus its efforts on improving transit and expediting the delivery of its long overdue transit projects, as well as examining options to improve utilization of the 407 if it is serious about reducing gridlock.\n"

Your government\u2019s approach to reduce traffic seems to be adding capacity for more cars?\u00a0There weren\u2019t many people walking on Bloor. Maybe you should consider removing the sidewalks too.\nThe Conservative Party seems to revel in demolition (see: The Science Centre, Ontario Place, the Greenbelt, etc. etc.)\nStop meddling in Toronto\u2019s business. There\u2019s a vast province with urgent issues and you guys are wasting time and resources on a few kilometres of safe lanes for cyclists.\u00a0Toronto paid for them to be installed and we voted for the people who approved them so leave them as they are.\n"

        "comment": "I disagree completely with the intent of this proposal. Ontario municipalities should have the autonomy to make decisions on active transportation within their jurisdiction, including bike lanes, to accommodate the needs of all residents and visitors. Toronto has bike lanes for a reason - the road traffic is and has always been a danger to cyclists. I myself, and my family members, have ridden there since 1990 \u2014 there are more cyclists than ever now (if Mr Ford and his staff ever got out of a car and rode in the city during morning rush hour they would know how important the core bike lanes are for the safety of the growing number of cyclists and other mobility device riders). Many Toronto residents, and many commuters NEED the bike lanes to make getting to work reasonably affordable. Taking the bike lanes away won\u2019t do anything to solve grid lock, but it will guarantee that people who can barely afford housing in this city (a travesty itself), will find it harder and harder to get to work (you think they will be the ones enjoying that extra lane of car traffic?  Decisions like this will also drive young professionals who work in the downtown core to leave the city because it will be impossible for them to get around safely and if they have to buy a car they\u2019ll head to the suburbs where they can have driveways to store them. The parking situation in Toronto which is already untenable, won\u2019t improve by bringing even more cars into the city core.  There needs to be careful (not populist) evaluation of what the transportation needs are for this region, and a long term plan (with financial commitment) to achieve it.  Look at cities like Amsterdam, Oslo, Helsinki, and Stockholm for inspiration. We do not all need to be behind a steering wheel. Our health improves when more people engage in active transportation. Our politicians need to make decisions that are more equitable for all. Why not consider making Toronto\u2019s downtown core car free instead?\n"

        "comment": "As a resident of Toronto without a car, and without a bicycle, bike lanes on Bloor St allow me to use the bike share instead of an uber to run a quick errand. I'm not someone who enjoys the prospect of cycling along with traffic, and the businesses I want to visit are on Bloor, not on a random side street. I work at Princess Margaret Hospital five days a week as a scientist and the new university bike lanes make the streetscape a more enjoyable atmosphere. They also provide a safe route for fellow coworkers to get to work on bike, rather than clog up the streets in a car. I urge you to reconsider the removal of bike lanes and stop BIll 212 in its tracks as the egregious overreach that it is which will only serve to make congestion worse and put many lives at risk\n"

        "comment": "This bill is gross provincial government overreach into municipal government\u2019s purview. Instead of focusing on the symptom (gridlock), both governments should focus on treating the disease by investing in efficient public transportation infrastructure, to get Ontario moving. If the province is interested in removing these bike lines, they should do a proper study instead of bending to the whims of the premier. Prove that removing bike lines will actually provide relief to gridlock, while actually increasing the rate of through-fair for all people (not just single people in cars). This study can and should be done by the municipality, and the results should be acted on accordingly by the municipality as part of larger planning projects. There is no place for blind ideological warfare such as this by a rationale government.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes need to be on major streets so that cyclists can safely access the businesses that primarily exist on them. Major streets are also often the only way to get between two locations in a reasonable way in Toronto proper. Six cyclists in Toronto have already been killed by cars this year, and this bill will put more in danger.\nThis bill is an overreach of provincial power and violates the governance of municipalities. It ignores all of the community consultations that went into installing these bike lanes in the first place. It is not backed by evidence which erodes any trust members of the public have in this government.\n"

        "comment": "This is an asinine decision that is designed to hurt businesses along all bike lanes, not just carrier services including same day/hour parcel services, let alone meal services. But anyone who rides casually for meals, groceries, and alcohol.\nOpening up roads to more cars will exacerbate traffic instead of reducing it as you could with more frequent mass transit like busses and streetcars.\nIf we were to re-introduce annual vehicle registration tags, I could understand the desire to increase road traffic to accommodate more revenue from vehicles. However with street maintenance as it is, bicycles have a lower impact than cars do.\nWe all know if there's consistent bumper-to-bumper traffic, the fastest method of travel is to get off the streets into a metro along the subway lines or to ride bicycles that can go past stopped vehicles.\nWhomever thought of this backwards plan must have some sponsor, because this is as dumb as bricks.\n"

Bicycles are entitled to take the entire lane on the road if needed and cars are supposed to pass bikes with a 1 meter gap. All this does is force bikes to mix with cars on the road. If cars are following the rules in the highway safety act this actually slows cars to the speed of bikes. Dangerous and dumb. Also, it is not clear to me that Doug Ford is qualified to set traffic policy or if he even understands the science. Does Doug really have time to police the development of local roads??\n"

We need less cars on the road and better, safer options to get around. We need better public transportation. No one should be driving downtown if they can help it. Maybe don\u2019t shut down every road with construction at the same time if you want traffic to improve. Try getting rid of street parking on arterial roads first before ripping up newly installed bike lanes that thousands of people use every day. Open the Eglinton LRT. Cyclists and pedestrians will die because of this. Another horrific blunder by Ford. Also bike lanes improve foot traffic and are actually good for businesses. There have been multiple studies done on this. Look it up.\n"
