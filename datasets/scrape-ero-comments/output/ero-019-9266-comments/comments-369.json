        "comment": "This is an absurd over-reach by the provincial government. The decision to add bike lanes falls under municipal jurisdiction and the City of Toronto's decision to add bike lanes to key corridors was informed by public consultation and data. Torontonians - and Ontarians - elect municipal elected officials to oversee these key decisions. Bike lanes were part of the most recent mayoral campaign and Mayor Chow received a very solid mandate - that DID NOT INCLUDE removing bike lanes. Removing bike lanes will not only result in wasting tax payer dollars - but will also affect public safety for cyclists and motorists alike - and create more gridlock by closing corridors to remove them. The provincial government should spend its time and energy investing in public transportation and other key issues within its jurisdiction - paying for housing and homelessness supports, investing in education, improving healthcare, addressing climate change and more. Regarding gridlock - the province should remove the tolls on the 407 and proactively invest in key highway/expressway infrastructure so we don't see it crumble and lose key access points like the east gardiner.\n"

        "comment": "This is a terrible idea for many reasons!  The business association in the areas being considered don't want to loose the bike lanes, the city the lanes are in doesn't want to loose the lanes, the lanes help prevent congestion by giving all those cyclists an OPTION to motorized transportation - something this government seems to not care about.  All of it's energies have been to INCREASE capacity for motorized transportation instead of providing options to avoid it.\nThe province has no place dictating to municipalities and cities what they do with their roads.  Even trying to force this legislation is just asking for a court challenge.\nThis government has had to flip flop on SO MANY issues because it runs off without data to support it's position and then has to reluctantly do a 180 in the face of reality.  When will you learn?  Get the data to back up the idea, then move forward.\n\"We hear complaints every day\" is not the data that supports this legislation.\n"

I support fully the Ontario Ford governments plan to move in and remove them.\nOur emergency vehicles cannot get thru the congestion, and we already have very slow response times for emergency calls.\nThe City of Toronto has proven time and time again how incompetent they are with every project they plan and act on.\nAs a tax paying citizen/resident of Toronto, I am absolutely disgusted with how our money is being spent right now and there should be some form of accountability to us the taxpayers.\nI hope Toronto leans from this, but paying (again) for removing the bike lanes would be a smarter use of our city\u2019s money than renaming Dundas street, and Yonge/Dundas square (of which public opinion proved they didn't want)\nWe cant cater to 1.2% of the city\u2019s population here.

        "comment": "Bill 212 will not work. The idea that removing bike lanes will relieve congestion is demonstrably false. If this Bill passes and the provincial government uses my tax money to remove bike lanes, traffic will not improve. This fact has been well known for decades, and countries all around the world have installed bike lanes and not seen negative impacts on traffic. The Ontario Provincial Planners Institute themselves have released a statement saying \"the proposed legislative changes will not reduce congestion\". Similarly, the Ontario Traffic Council have released their own statement saying \"knowledgeable and experienced engineers and planners would suggest there is no data to support this concept.\" Considering that the literal institutions that handle planning for the province are saying it won't work, this seems like a massive waste of time and money. This is also not even taking into account the safety and environmental mess that more cars will put us in. A mere 7 years ago, the premier himself said: \"You\u2019re nervous when there\u2019s no bike lanes. At least I was. We have to do everything we can to make sure there\u2019s never a death in the city. One death is way too many when it comes to bicycle riders.\" He knows people are going to die if bike lanes are removed. And 120 physicians and UofT researchers know it too, and have given their own statement on it. Bike lanes allow transportation for people who can't afford a car. Bike lanes are conducive to healthier lifestyles and therefore eases pressure on the healthcare system. But sure, waste money tearing them up so we can have twice as many cars stuck in gridlock as we do now.\n"

        "comment": "I'm retired, and I still ride my bike. I used to ride it to work, despite the difficulties of doing so without protected bike baths. Recently, I rode it  along the Bloor West bike lanes to get to my hair dresser, and to my dentist. It was wonderful! I also occasionally drive a car, and I now find driving much easier with the bike paths in place. With just one lane, and turn lanes where needed, it was much safer than when drivers are weaving in and out of two lanes in their desperate attempt to shave two minutes off their trip. And finally, I use the subway a lot, and often wonder about the drivers who could be using the Bloor line. I realize that not everyone can ride a bike or the subway, but if those who could did, just think what it would mean for our environment!\nImpact on the environment should be the key consideration. The announcement says: \"Implications to the environment will be considered as the ministry identifies and develops the criteria for evaluating proposed new and existing cycling lanes.\"  What measurements will be done to determine the implications of possibly eliminating bike lanes? We already know that fires, floods, hurricanes and other disasters are being exacerbated by the use of fossil fuels. We should be encouraging, not discouraging, people's use of bicycles. The guidelines for a decision should also consider the health implications of encouraging people to cycle. We struggle to provide enough doctors, nurses and other medical help for people, knowing that prevention of illness is one of the keys. Cycling helps to keep people healthy.\nIt will take time for people in suburbs such as Etobicoke to start using the bike paths in sufficient numbers to counter the opposition of drivers. The heavy use of bike lanes in the downtown areas suggests that we should give the bike lanes on Bloor West a chance, and evaluate them after a few years. Some of the current congestion is related to construction. There has always been congestion at the intersections of Bloor and Jane, and Bloor and South Kingsway. However, the condo construction at the corner of Bloor and South Kingsway, and the diversion of city buses on to Bloor Street instead of north on Jane because of the redevelopment of the Jane subway station are adding to it. I wonder, as well, if a left turn signal at the corner of Bloor and Armadale would prevent unnecessary backup of eastbound traffic on Bloor.\n"

        "comment": "Hello. Bike lanes are essential for the safety of the city\u2019s cyclists. Cycles provide an essential alternative to cars for many of the city\u2019s population - who will likely be forced to use cars if not provided a safe lane to bike in. The research doesn\u2019t indicate that an additional lane will compensate for the additional traffic. This legislation will also result in more deaths and injuries of cyclists that do persist after the removal of dedicated bike lanes. This bill won\u2019t do what it is proposed for and will worsen conditions in downtown Toronto. Please do not pass it.\n"

Costly construction will only cost taxpayers time and money and will make traffic worse in both the short-term, and long-term.

We bike everywhere as a family but as a cyclist I often feel like a citizen of less importance and am shocked frankly at the rhetoric used here to keep people in their cars. Toronto is still in the 50s and it\u2019s frustrating to see. Start with measuring who rides their bikes where at least. How can you make decisions with no data. Go to Europe, it\u2019s been done before. I ride my bike to work and the bike lane is busy. The transition needs to happen. Pay now or pay later.

        "comment": "I grew up in Toronto, but lived elsewhere for most of my adult life, including 5 years outside of Ontario. I moved back to Toronto in September 2023. People frequently ask me how the city has changed in the several years I was away. I commonly say \"well, rent more than doubled, but at least the cycling infrastructure has significantly improved!\" Cycling has been my primary mode of transportation in every city I've lived in, now including Toronto - much to my delight.\nDoug Ford's campaign to remove the bike lanes along Bloor, Yonge, and University - and to require provincial review of all new bike lanes that require the removal of a lane of vehicular traffic - make me very concerned and angry! I am concerned for my safety and the safety of many in my community. I am concerned that this move represents provincial overreach into municipal authority. I am concerned that its intended outcome of easing congestion will not materialize - I and many other cyclists will remain cyclists, and we will continue cycling on the arterial roads that remain (in most cases) the only way to get from Point A to Point B with any efficiency. We will share the lanes with cars, increasing our risk and decreasing the speed of traffic. Further, and more importantly, as several other cities around the world demonstrate, creating effective transportation systems requires not more roads or lanes for drivers, but that more investment in public transit and cycling infrastructure so that there are simply fewer cars on the road! There is no common sense in this proposal.\nI am angry that there is no long-term vision or strategy here - if these lanes are returned to vehicular traffic, what happens when they fill up? We can only build so many roads! Cars create traffic. Ever been to Los Angeles? Tons of highways and roads, and tons of traffic! Why are the Eglinton and Finch LRT projects still not finished?  Why are we not building more GO transit stations and lines throughout the GTA to bring commuters into Toronto in ways that minimize congestion and pollution?\nI am angry that this proposal will be a colossal waste of taxpayer money. I am angry at the hypocrisy of this government, which is so willing to spend money removing the safe bike lanes that enable me and thousands of others to efficiently navigate around the city on a daily basis - some of which were so recently completed, after ample studies and spending - while telling taxpayers how much they value our money. You do not value my money or my life.\nThis proposal unnecessarily politicizes cyclists' lives and keeps Toronto stuck in the past. If you're going to bring Toronto back to how it was when I last lived here in 2015, please cut rent in half and bring back rent control.\n"
