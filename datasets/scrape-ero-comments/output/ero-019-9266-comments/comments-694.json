Protected bike lanes are efficient, affordable and a fun way of getting large numbers through our city. Removing these lanes is a step backward. Cities are not built to be efficient merely for cars to get from A to B, they should be built for people and all modes. The data is clear on Bloor West around increase consumer spending post-bike lane installation. The minister's use of the 1.2% mode share figure is disingenuous. He should ride GO more frequently to the city from Brampton given that highway gridlock is so poor.\n"

        "comment": "I oppose Bill 212. I believe it to be a gross over-stepping of bounds by the provincial government. The people who know best what can be done for a city\u2019s roads are the people who live in that city, the people who use them every day. I believe that Mayor Chow and the Toronto City Council are much better suited to decide where bike lanes will or will not exist in Toronto than the Provincial Government which has far more pressing Provincial concerns to be addressing. The health and prosperity of a city is dependent on the health and mobility of the people who live there and Bill 212 would set the priority to be having cars go as quickly as possible from one place to another instead of prioritizing the health and safety of the vast majority of the city\u2019s residents who don\u2019t own cars. It\u2019s been shown time and time again in cities across Canada, all of North America, and the world, that adding more lanes for cars does not reduce traffic. It often makes traffic worse by incentivizing cars usage and ownership which in turn raises the need for car storage and parking which reduces the amount of limited land that can be used for housing and businesses, the places people want to go.\n"

        "comment": "This is probably one of the most uninformed, short sighted, and ignorant takes on what is causing \u201ctraffic\u201d it is just as laughable as this government\u2019s incompetence. Bicycles, especially in Toronto (which seems to be the focus of this \u201cinitiative\u201d), are a low cost, efficient and effective way of moving around the city. The only source of fatalities they cause are when cars are involved. Removing bike lanes from major streets then pushed cyclists to smaller residential streets where their presence is felt even more so due to the size of the streets. All in all, that just means you\u2019re taking \u201ctraffic\u201d from one area and putting it in another, you\u2019re not solving the issue.\nIf this government was actually serious about reducing traffic, maybe they would focus on what is causing it. Last I checked, it was cars that contribute to traffic, whether moving or parked on major streets. Creating more lanes does not reduce traffic, it creates more. The fact that there are enough cars on the road that create this large of a problem means that there is a failing in larger more efficient ways of moving large groups of people. Most cars on the road have one person in them. That is one person that is now taking up the same footprint as about 8 people. This to me signals that public transit needs an overhaul in terms of support and frequency. It needs to become more of an option to the public than it currently is. We can not be making commuting by car in a city more attractive.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is dangerous and I don't believe it is based in actual data. Many studies - and actual experiences in other cities - have shown that bike lanes actually reduce congestion, because they provide an alternative to cars. I am ceratin that other commenters have linked to these data. An effective approach to reducing gridlock in Ontario would be improvements to public transit, so that people can choose not to take a car. Particularly in Ottawa, where I live, I have seen people revert to using a car because they can't trust the transit system to be on time and reliable. This is something that could be fixed: a lot of people would prefer to be on a bus or train but just can't afford the uncertainty. Fixing that system would reduce gridlock far more than removing a bike lane.\nBike lanes also save lives, by reducing the conflicts between cars and bikes. As a cyclist is allowed to take the full lane if it is safer for them to do so, this bill would put even more bikes in front of cars, rather than beside them in a separate lane where they don't obstruct traffic. And also - the increased proximity between people on bikes and people in cars will - not might, will - lead to increased deaths and injuries on our roads.\nFinally, I'm begging the designers of this bill to look at the concept of \"induced demand.\" Any time a road is widened, it might improve things for a short time, but as more people start to use the new infrastructiure, it clogs right back up again. This has been demonstrated over and over.\n"

        "comment": "I support this proposal. Traffic in Toronto is, quite frankly, out of control. My commute, which is a total of ten (10) kilometres, frequently takes in excess of an hour and a half. During the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, my commute took less than thirty (30) minutes. For this reason alone, I support more oversight of bike lanes where doing so will require the removal of a traffic lane. Traffic is out of control and measures should be taken to improve this significant problem. However, I am also a resident of Etobicoke, where the City of Toronto recently eliminated a traffic lane in favour of a bike lane. As an Etobicoke resident, I have become acutely aware of the implications of poorly thought-out bike lanes (and city planning generally) may have. While traffic increased, the City of Toronto also inexplicably decided to add bike lanes to my neighbourhood, reducing lanes on Bloor Street from two (2) lanes to just one (1). The area of Bloor Street near the South Kingsway has always been busy. However since the City of Toronto added bike lanes, it has become unbearable. I note further that I have never had to stop for a cyclist while traveling on this stretch of Bloor Street. Not once have I encountered a cyclist, and yet my commute has increased by at least fifteen (15) minutes due to increased traffic caused by this bike lane alone. It is entirely nonsensical that these changes were made without more significant forethought, including consideration about whether a material number of people would even use these bike lanes. While I support this proposal, I do not support it to the exclusion of other initiatives to reduce traffic and improve accessibility within the city, via vehicle and public transit. I hope this government will, in addition to the proposals contained in the Bill 212, will also look to other areas to improve traffic flow.\n"

        "comment": "I am a retired Torontonian who cycles for errands, such as shopping on Bloor and giving blood at Yonge and Bloor. I also cycle to save money/ gas, for exercise and to reduce pollution. I also drive but have reduced my car use in favour of walking, cycling and TTC when possible. I avoid cycling only very few days of the year, such as during snow storms. I also cycle for fun and in those cases often use the bike lanes to get to other bike infrastructure.  Protected bike lanes on major arterial roads are essential to me for safe and efficient movement around the city. I live near Dupont where there are many large condo towers going up, all with little parking, so bike lanes will need to be expanded not reduced to accommodate this increased housing. I would be upset to have my tax dollars spent on removing well designed and integrated and essential bike lanes.\n"

I also have a vehicle that I drive regularly when the weather is bad, or for errands or to leave the city. It is important to balance the needs of bikes and cars. The bike lanes in the city are essential in creating safer roads. Even as a driver, I appreciate the presence of bike lanes as they help me look out for and not harm cyclists. Traffic is annoying, yes, but there are better ways to target that issue than to make the streets even more unsafe for people who are making the choice to cycle. The city is so dominated by roads with so few bike lanes already. This act would stop and reverse the small progress that has been made already on bike lanes. And it would be incredibly wasteful and frustrating, in terms of time and finances, to reverse the bike lane progress made so far. The idea that the province would encroach on the powers of municipalities like this, to push through and impose approaches from a different level of government is very frustrating. This is a deeply bad idea and it makes me angry that it is being pummelled through the political process.\n"

        "comment": "Many others can tell you more about transportation and traffic engineering than I can. I'm here to argue in favour not of bike lanes, but of evidence-based policy, or as I call it, \"making sense.\"\nMr. Ford has pushed forward this bill because he doesn't like sitting in his chauffeured limousine on his way to Queen's Park and seeing other Torontonians pass him in the bike lane. I will support this statement.\nWe don't have any reason to think that Yonge, Bloor, or University will be faster without bike lanes. It's a complicated question, I know. But we know we don't have any reason to think Bill 212 will help anyone get around any particular congestion, because you haven't (not yet!) set up any mechanisms at the Ministry to gather information, evaluate pilot projects, establish decision criteria, and make decisions. You're just not in that business, are you? -- but cities are. Toronto, for instance, spent many years figuring out where the bike lanes should be to get the most riders safely across the street grid, while disrupting other road users the least. A whole staff of people, hundreds of consultations, multiple years. I wonder when you opened this file, Minister Sarkaria? Middle of September, no?\nSo the provincial government does not have evidence that tells us yes, we should tear out Bloor, Yonge, University, or any other bike lane, and return it to a mixture of bikes and cars. You don't have it.\nSo we're left with \"Because Doug hates them\" and \u201cBecause his friends asked\u201d as the reasons why the province is interfering in municipal streetscape decisions. Surely it's not too different from the decision to defund and then shutter the Ontario Science Centre, or indeed his first act as premiere, breaking contracts with hundreds of wind and solar power producers in the province.\nIn all of these cases, we didn't make careful decisions based on understanding the problems or evaluating the evidence that should guide us. Nope, we just went with Doug's gut. It's not good enough -- one man's prejudices shouldn't guide important choices that affect the people of Ontario. This is just not how grown-ups make decisions, especially life or death decisions affecting how our citizens get to work or school every day.\n"

Intuitively, it may seem like reverting bike lanes into a car lane would decrease traffic, however doing so, would encourage more folks to utilize cars to head downtown rather than use bikes and public transport which is known to be better for the environment. It is 2024, and removing a bike lane is backward. What makes Montreal's city so vibrant and beautiful is its incorporation of bike lanes, parks and greeneries, I often admire the beauty of seeing people versus cars. Allow Toronto to be the epicentre for green and sustainable living, and therefore, a point of influence for other mega-cities worldwide. Cars are not sustainable, building roads/highways and removing bike lanes to allow more cars on the road is backwards and does not consider the long-term impacts on civilians in our city. I plead that the government review the long-term costs of enacting this bill and consider how these bike lanes and biking in the city be made safer and the programming be revitalized to encourage health, saving, and sustainability in our city.\n"

Ttc is too unreliable most days and I cannot drive. My children need their parents to get home safely. Bike lanes reduce congestion and help the environment in the long run.
