As cities are exploring options to get good transportation your government is stuck on keeping cars in the cities and making roads unsafe for all the people going about their day on foot.\nI would like my government to explore other avenues for getting less cars into the city not more, work on trains, subways.\n"

No bike lanes will mean endangering the lives of those cycling, or choosing to drive which will inevitably cause more traffic. Even if you never want to ride a bike, you should support bike lanes for your own benefit!\nTearing up existing ones is a terrible use of our tax dollars and goes against the policies our own city has planned. Terrible proposal!!\n"

Without the bike lanes I would not feel safe enough to bike to businesses in Etobicoke. I also drive and I do not believe removing the bike-lanes would improve traffic. If anything should be removed its the on-street parking on Bloor.\n"

Rather than making cycling less safe for road users, the province should focus on other issues and stop trying to buy votes from car users. Cycling is efficient, eco friendly, fast, and healthy.\n"

        "comment": "This bill adds more red tape and bureaucracy to an already slow system. This bill is an overreach by the provincial government. I believe the municipal government understands the needs of the City of Toronto better than the provincial government.\nThe bike lanes on Bloor St., Yonge St., and University Ave. were very expensive for the city and it's undoubtedly a foolish waste of tax dollars to remove them.\nWhen I cycle, I do not feel safe with cars, or on sidewalks with pedestrians. When I drive, I do not want to be slowed down by cyclists in front of me. When I'm walking, I do not want cyclists blazing by me. Cycling deserves the same safety and respect that pedestrians and drivers get. Bike lanes save lives.\nThe removal of bike lanes restricts my freedom of choice in transportation.\nCycling is highly compatible with existing transit infrastructure. I can easily dismount and take my bike on subways, streetcars and busses.\nEncouraging citizens to cycle will take more cars off the road, reducing congestion. Removing them will cause many cyclists to drive, increasing congestion and commute times for drivers.\nCycling is better than driving in terms of space efficiency, environmental emissions, noise pollution, mental and physical wellbeing, accessibility, and sense of community.\n"

        "comment": "The removal of bike lanes is a regressive piece of policy. Torontonians deserve options other than cars when it comes to intracity transit. Cycling is a healthy, green, and low cost mode of transit that is much more accessible than driving to many, including students and residents in condos with limited parking space. I will cycle much more if safe cycling paths and lanes are available, and I'm sure the same applies for many others across the city.\n"

        "comment": "The proposed Bill 212 is an extraordinary overreach into municipal jurisdiction. It will prevent the installation of life-saving infrastructure that is an essential part of an efficient and forward-looking transportation system, wasting taxpayers\u2019 money in the process.\nBike lanes are essential infrastructure for cyclists just as sidewalks are for pedestrians, and bus stops are for transit users. Car drivers are not the only road users, and bike lanes help keep our streets safe for ALL users. As a driver myself, I prefer when cyclists have the option to stay safely out of my way in a protected bike lane - I don\u2019t even need to worry about getting into an accident. I also appreciate having the option to leave the car at home and travel safely by bike, as it is faster and more convenient when making trips within my neighbourhood and in the surrounding areas.\nBill 212 discriminates against those who cannot afford a car or cannot drive, marginalizing individuals who rely on cycling to commute to work, to school or to pick up their children. It sends a message to a portion of our population that they are undeserving of safe access to our roads, infrastructure, and businesses. Doug Ford\u2019s inflammatory rhetoric only fuels tensions between drivers and cyclists, leaving cyclists, the more vulnerable of the two, at a severe disadvantage.\nFinally, ripping out existing bike lanes and cancelling plans developed by municipalities, which are better equipped to understand local traffic patterns and needs, is a blatant waste of taxpayers\u2019 money. The road closures required to remove bike lanes and redo lanes will in fact worsen congestion and commute times for ALL road users. Implementing a provincial review process for bicycle infrastructure will only add unnecessary red tape and bureaucracy to a process that does not and should not fall under provincial jurisdiction.\nOverall, Bill 212 is a regressive policy and will be harmful not only to cyclists, but to all road users. Cycling is a low cost, healthy and environmentally friendly method of transportation that gets people out of their cars, reducing the amount of congestion on the roads. Cycling infrastructure is an essential part of a efficient transportation system, enabling people to drive less and reach public transit hubs from further away.\nIf the province wants to get people and goods out of gridlock, and recognizes that accidents and lane closures worsen traffic congestion (as stated in bill 212) the province should focus on delivering public transit projects and on building bike infrastructure that prevents accidents and saves lives.\n"

        "comment": "This is a ridiculous over reach and a colossal waste of tax payer money. Especially when the routes are already finished or under construction.\nBesides the time and money already put into the Bloor bike lanes, and other existing lanes, and how much safer they make it for cyclists as well as for drivers like myself (I do NOT want to maim or kill someone because we were too close together) I remember Bloor st before the bike lanes and it was always slow and congested. Cars would be parked in the second lane most of the day effectively reducing the street to one lane anyway. Now with designated parking mixed in, parked cars, cyclists, and drivers have better designated space.\nA much better use for this money would be insisting on minimum transit time standards and strengthening transit in the suburbs and smaller cities and towns as well going toward making the TTC clean, safe, and affordable again. The fact that this is the same government the cancelled an in-progress, already funded basic income study instead of allowing it to finish shows you their priorities are not for actual people, communities or businesses. How well will business fair when the streets are under construction AGAIN during a recession and the money is just thrown away.  NO to Bill 212\n"

        "comment": "Subject: Strong Opposition to Bill 212 and Proposed Removal of Bike Lanes\nDear Members of the Ontario Legislature,\nI am writing to express my strong opposition to Bill 212, particularly the provisions that would allow for the removal of existing bike lanes, including the newly built lanes on Bloor, Yonge, and University streets. As a daily bike lane user, I have witnessed the positive impact these lanes have on our community, providing safer spaces for cyclists and promoting a more livable city.\nThe bike lanes on Bloor, Yonge, and University streets are essential not only for ensuring the safety of cyclists but also for improving the overall traffic environment. By incorporating greenery and making the roads feel narrower, these lanes effectively slow down car traffic, encouraging drivers to be more cautious. This design approach enhances the safety of all road users and contributes to a more sustainable urban ecosystem.\nIt is particularly disheartening to see how the mentality of our leadership can undermine progress. In \"Fordnation,\" Doug Ford openly expresses his disdain for bike lanes, revealing a narrow perspective that prioritizes his personal commute over the broader needs of our community. His reasoning\u2014that he dislikes seeing bikes pass him while he sits in traffic\u2014reflects a selfish and simple-minded approach that is not conducive to effective policy-making. It is troubling that such views are allowed to shape transportation policy in Ontario, leading to decisions that ignore the growing demand for cycling infrastructure and the benefits it brings.\nIt is vital to recognize that the removal of these bike lanes would undermine the progress we have made toward creating a safer and more accessible city. Instead of reducing our cycling infrastructure, we should be focusing on expanding and improving it to encourage more residents to choose cycling as a viable and healthy transportation option.\nFurthermore, transportation policies should be grounded in sound evidence and scientific principles, ensuring that decisions reflect the needs and safety of our communities. I urge the government to reconsider the implications of this bill and prioritize the protection and expansion of our cycling infrastructure.\nThank you for your attention to this important matter.\n"

        "comment": "The proposal is contrary to the overwhelming body of research indicating that bike lanes reduce traffic, reduce accidents, and are good for business on those thoroughfares. https://www.cbc.ca/news/science/bike-lanes-impacts-1.7358319. It is not an evidence-based policy choice and will worsen traffic, accident rates, business, and the environment.\nNumbers that the Province has tried to use to support its claim, such as the fact that \"only 1.2% of Toronto citizens use bike lanes,\" misrepresent the reality that bike lanes are used where they exist and that bike lane usage is much higher in areas where there are actually bike lanes to be used. In particular, that statistic includes areas like Richmond Hill and Vaughan, whereas bike usage studies in the city proper \"found that 44 per cent of Torontonians bike in good weather to get to school, work, shop or visit friends. It also found 26 per cent of people bike for fun or fitness only, making 70 per cent of Torontonians cyclists in some capacity\" https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/toronto-bike-lane-1-2-per-cent-1\u2026\nBeyond its focus on Toronto, looking across the province this legislation runs counter to the prevailing evidence that bike lanes promote local business, reduce traffic, reduce accidents, and should be a goal for municipalities across the province to strive towards rather than a target for removal and restriction.\n"

Bike lanes provide increased transportation options and freedom for people who cannot drive due to factors such as age or lack of a car. Active transportation such as cycling supports the health and wellbeing of Ontarians but having safe infrastructure to do so is necessary. The government ought to protect the safety of Ontarians and removing existing infrastructure will cause roads to become more dangerous for vulnerable road users. Designated bike lanes can help drivers as well, since cyclists are often slower than cars and having a separate lane allows drivers to pass them more easily without lane changes.\n"
