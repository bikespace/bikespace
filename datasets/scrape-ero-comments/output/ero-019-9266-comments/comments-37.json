I implore the government to prioritize safety and maintain this infrastructure. Removing this will force more to take vehicles, defeating the entire point of removing bike lanes. The government should be cleaning up the TTC, not waging a war against cyclists which wastes money and is counterproductive.\n"

        "comment": "This is a short-sighted piece of legislation that does nothing to address the main cause of congestion (that i, the number of cars on the road), and instead will be adding to it, not to mention the number of people killed in vehicular collisions.\nIn order to address congestion, people need safe, viable alternatives to get from point A to point B if they do not want to drive. By opening up other ways of getting places, only those who want to drive are going to be doing so, and anyone else can find an alternative to use, meaning the people on the roads are those who enjoy driving rather than it being a necessity.\n"

        "comment": "Worldwide, it is well known that bikes lanes do not increase congestion. Only adding vehicle lanes increases congestion.\nBike lanes improve business, improve safety and adjust the manner in which people move around an urban area. The livability our our urban neighbourhoods should not come at the expense of the suburban driver. We live here too. We have spent the last 50+ years catering to the car, it is time to change that and focus on sustainable transportation such as bikes, scooters, walking and public transit. I would suggest one just look at the 401 as an example of poor urban design. We should be forward thinking, not harkening back to the 1950s.\nMost car drivers do not tolerate pedestrians, bikes, other drivers and generally anything that prevents them from getting to their destination as fast as they can with free parking right outside.\nThis draft legislation is garbage and should not proceed.\n"

Bike lanes on main roads are vital to providing transportation for those to move around cities, especially in congested areas.   The funds proposed to make these changes would have a much further impact if they were put towards a stronger public transit system.\n"

The stores I can get to using a bike lane are the ones getting my business because I don't trust people in cars to watch out for me. Car drivers see cyclists as a nuisance. They drive too close to me if there is no bike lane but they do generally respect my space when there is a bike lane.\n"

        "comment": "It is extremely frustrating to see this government try to scapegoat bike lanes as an explanation for the gridlock and traffic congestion facing our cities. Research on this topic conducted in North America and other countries consistently indicates that protected bike lanes do not significantly worsen traffic congestion or emergency vehicle response times. In many cases, bike lanes actually reduce the number of cars on the road and improve traffic flow by providing people with the option of cycling instead of driving their car. Indeed, as a taxpayer in Toronto who rides my bike as my primary way to get around the city, dedicated and protected bike lanes allow me to leave my car at home and and feel safe riding my bike instead. Tearing up bike lanes is a sure way to put more cars on the road by discouraging people from using alternative modes of transportation. Bike lanes also save lives, period. This is confirmed by the results of many studies showing that bike lanes make roads safer for cyclists, pedestrians, and even other drivers. Six cyclist have already died riding in Toronto this year. This number is sure to increase if you rip up bike lanes that people use every day to get to work, ride with their kids to school, and visit family and friends. Our cities are facing gridlock and traffic congestion due to increasing population and urban sprawl, the latter of which has been encouraged by the current government's policies. Instead of interfering with the ability of cities to make decisions based on the needs of residents living in their neighbourhoods, the provincial government should be focusing on speeding up the delivery of public transit options that provide the best way to ease traffic congestion and gridlock.\n"

        "comment": "This is ridiculous overreach. Bike lanes should be left to the discretion of the municipality. If we are to meet climate targets then we should be encouraging the use of bike lanes and indeed building protected bike lanes so people can travel safely. Bikes are a cost effective and health promoting way to travel, and every cyclist is just as entitled to use of the road as is any motorist. Cyclists deserve the same respect and consideration.\n"

Ontario does not have fast, reliable public transit and that needs to be solved before adding in a new highway.\n"

        "comment": "I cycle about 7km one way to work from home. I do this because it gives me exercise and flexibility to change my route. I wear a helmet, I have front and back lights, I use my bell. I bike on a route with no bikes lanes and bike lanes and have drastically different experiences. When sharing the road I am met with distracted drivers, left turns, impatient drivers cutting off cyclists and other motorists, etc. During those times I am on those routes I need to be hyper vigilant. I have narrowly avoided injuries or potential death because of shared roads and bad driving.\nBike lanes save lives and aren\u2019t the contributors to congestion or detrimental impacts to economies. In fact, cycling allows me to make stops at businesses I wouldn\u2019t normally frequent. Bikes are better for the environment too and when I can\u2019t bike I use public transit for my commutes.\n"

        "comment": "I do not support this legislation. Reducing congestion is best done by enticing peopke our of cars. Bike lanes reduce congestion. Meanwhile, multiple through lanes on city roads seems to increase congestion as drivers change lanes and some weave back and forth.\nFurthermore, these road design decisions must stay with cities, who are closer and more responsive to road users compared to a provincial ministy.\n"

        "comment": "As a resident, bike lanes keep me and my family safe. They allow me to get to work (which often starts before the subway opens) safely. When my child had a fever, they let me get her to the ER and home again without stressing about people speeding too close to us on the empty, late-night streets.\nAs a manager of a coffee shop, the Danforth bike lanes have greatly helped the business where I work. People can get to us more easily, with parking out front even during rush hour. I look out onto the street and I don\u2019t see gridlock - I see people, out and able to safely walk and bike around their neighbourhood, with the traffic moving at pretty much the same pace as before.\nThese efforts by the provincial government are frankly disgusting. We are talking about the safety of tens of thousands of people, our environment - the future world for my children - for a few minutes shorter commute for drivers. Which they won\u2019t even get, because bike lanes don\u2019t slow down traffic.\n"

I\u2019m extremely concerned at this new bill which would take planning for bike lanes out of where it should be\u2014at the municipal level. Use the money you would put towards evaluating and removing bike lanes towards something that will really get the city moving like transit improvements. Leave city planning to the city.\n"

Pre-launch studies showed 85% non-compliance with the 50kph posted speed limit with the average speed being 19kph over the limit.  During the pilot and after reduction from 4 lanes to 3 they found a 90% compliance with the 40kph speed limit with the average speed being 1kph UNDER the already lowered limit.  It also made it EASIER for EMS to travel through with the centre lane being largely free of traffic.\nThis legislation is effectively making it impossible for proven safer street design to be implemented province wide and puts lives of all road users at risk.\n"
