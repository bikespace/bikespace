        "comment": "I don't understand why the province must oversee municipal projects like bike lanes on major and side roads in cities, particularly existing bike lanes. I believe the province has more important issues to tackle with available funds, such as providing adequate healthcare in our province and providing living wages to healthcare workers and teachers, as well as improving transit systems in our province which will help reduce traffic congestion more than opening construction on roads to remove existing bike lanes.\nI think removing existing bike lanes is a costly exercise that will waste taxpayer funds and will not improve safety or congestion. According to CBC News, removing bike lanes on Jarvis Street was even more expensive than implementing them. According to the CBC report, installing these lanes cost $59,000 in 2010, and removing the bike lanes on Javis Street in 2011 cost $200,000. This leads me to believe that future projects removing recently implemented, existing bike lanes will be wasteful regarding resources and taxpayer funds.\n"

A waste of money. A bad idea. Let the communities make the decision. That's what voting and community forums are for.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose the removal of bike lanes in our city. Bike lanes provide a safe space for cyclists, reduce traffic congestion, and promote eco-friendly transportation. By encouraging biking, we can decrease car emissions, improve air quality, and contribute to the health and well-being of our community. Removing these lanes could lead to more accidents, discourage cycling, and make our streets less accessible to those who rely on bicycles for transportation. Instead of taking a step backward, we should focus on enhancing our biking infrastructure to support a more sustainable and healthy future for all residents.\nFurthermore, studies in cities like New York and Copenhagen show that bike lanes do not increase car congestion. In fact, they can help reduce it by encouraging more people to cycle instead of drive. In these cities, dedicated bike infrastructure has been shown to move people more efficiently, freeing up road space and reducing the number of cars on the road. So once again I encourage you to think, instead of taking a step backward, we should focus on enhancing our biking infrastructure to support a more sustainable and healthy future for all residents.\n"

        "comment": "The uncontrolled proliferation of bike lanes in Toronto is killing businesses, productivity and garnering the city a reputation as one of the most gridlocked cities in the world. The \"studies\" and \"reports\" authored by activists touting the effectiveness of bike lanes while negating impacts on trafic volume and road safety are baseless propaganda. One only needs to camp on one of the busy arteries where they have been installed to conclude that bike utilization simply doesn't even come close to justifiying their existence. Nevermind the negative impact their deployment has had on businesses in the city's core. Let's get real and let's get traffic moving again. Bikes are fine as a means of transport for a small minority but bike lanes do not belong on major arteries especially in our climate where cycling is realistically feasible 3-4 mths per year\n"

        "comment": "We should be proposing changes to our province that encourage alternate ways of getting around to cars, especially in a major city. If you look at big cities around the world, they have all embraced public transit and biking over cars, they have even gone as far as to have tolls or other means to discourage driving in the city. If we still want to focus on car traffic, there are studies from other major cities that show that bike lanes do not create more traffic, they reduce the number of cars on the road. If you make it easier for cars to get around there will just be more cars, it won't actually solve the traffic issue and it will make biking less safe.\nGiving the province control over bike lanes in Toronto is a mistake. We should be focussing on reducing cars and making it easier for people to use other more environmentally friendly modes of transport.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes will not solve the problem of gridlock and will only increase the chances of injury and death for cyclists. The idea that bike lanes should only be on secondary roads also doesn't make sense as it is on the major roads that the additional protection of bike lanes is needed. Cities around the world are working to increase the number of bike lanes and encourage cycling as a method of transportation. Why would the province want to move in the opposite direction? The only solution to gridlock is to have fewer vehicles on the road and the way to do that is to provide safe alternatives including reliable, frequent transit options and extensive and safe bike lanes.\n"

I believe the government should focus on getting PEOPLE to where they need to go and the best way to do this is to focus on transit and other alternative forms of transportation. Removing bike lanes will have a negligible impact on commute times. The provincial government should focus on matters that are in the purview of the provincial government. Things like health care and education. Our health care system is in a crisis. There's not enough teachers at my kids school. Leave the management of municipal infrastructure to the municipal government.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal makes no sense. The traffic nightmare we are experiencing is caused by years of not investing in transit infrastructure - not by bike lanes. The city of Toronto has significantly worse public transit connections than many other city of it's size. My office is a 10 minute drive from the airport, to get their by transit it takes 50 minutes. Same is true with my commute, transit is no option, it would take me twice as long despite the gridlock on the 401.\nThe solution to traffic is not adding more lanes or building tunnels to add more lanes or taking bicycle lanes away, studies have shown this. The solution is taking cars off the streets.\nHow do you take cars off the street? Make other modes of transportation more competitive. Our public transit needs to be quicker, more reliable, and safer.\nThe 401 at its widest point has 22 lanes and it is still backed up with traffic around the clock and on the weekends. To think removing a bikelane on Bloor or University will improve our traffic problem is delusional.\nBuild subways, highspeed train connections, and make it easier for people to bike/scooter/walk - not harder.\n"

        "comment": "This is an idiotic proposal on so many levels. It's a gross overreach into municipal jurisdiction. It's clear that the focus is Toronto \u2014 coincidentally enough, the lanes between Queen's Park and Etobicoke. I wonder why.\nThis is far from evidence-based. 'Induced demand' means that in the long run, more space for cars will result in more cars. Bike lanes on secondary streets are not a bad thing, however not always possible (in Toronto, for example, the only continuous east-west connections happen to be major roads eg. King, Queen, Dundas, College, Bloor).\nDo you want to hear from people who live in their communities, or just commuters passing by?\nSpending at Bloor St businesses has gone up with the installation of bike lanes. Emergency Services have not raised concerns. The \"justifications\" are clearly constructed and not based in any evidence.\nWhy not target on-street parking?\nThis clearly isn't about getting people home quickly and safely.\n"

I have, sadly, witnessed cyclists being hit by cars more than once in my years in Toronto, always on streets without bike lanes. We should not continue seeing the number of cyclists hit grow. Please do not do this.\n"

        "comment": "There are so many studies done that debunk the claims being made by the Transport Minister and Premiere, that it's insulting to everyone in Ontario that this is even being considered.  Not only is it a massive overreach by the province into municipal affairs.  Maybe instead of trying to distract people with wedge issues like this, the provincial government that is famously known wasting money on terrible and unnecessary things could put some of those funds towards ideas that can actually help resolve gridlock and saving people time.  This means getting trucks off the 401 by subsidizing their 407 bills, getting two-way all day rail lines up and running as soon as possible, investing in transit systems, and allowing for gentle density housing.\nThe idea you can just push cyclists onto side streets is absurd.  In my city, the only ways to get around is on the major roads because of river crossings.  Does the Premiere intend to fund cities across the province with millions, if not billions of dollars to build the province proper cycling infrastructure and pedestrian bridges to keep us off these major arteries?  I wouldn't count on it!\nUntil Doug Ford makes cycling illegal (which honestly wouldn't shock me at this point) cyclists should exercise their rights and claim lanes as needed; all this legislation will do is slow down traffic and create more gridlock, and people will have no one to blame but an out of touch provincial government that ran out ideas a long time ago.\nThis is a full blown collapse of forward thinking for infrastructure planning, and anyone involved should be embarrassed that they even tried putting this legislation forward.\n"
