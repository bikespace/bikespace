I use public transit to commute to work because bike lanes are NOT available to get me safely from downtown Toronto to York University, where I work. More importantly, a number of my university students--and I'm sure, college students--are put at risk because biking is considerably cheaper than public transit or cars.\nTo me, this proposal is simply ridiculous. Put the money into improving public transit or reducing its cost. Put more money into bike lanes, especially in the suburbs, so that more of my students have a less expensive AND SAFER means of travel to their schools--their high schools, their colleges, their universities. The more cars you put on the road, the more at risk our young people are.\nThis issues arises in every class I teach. THERE IS NO SAFE WAY TO BIKE FROM MY STUDENTS' HOMES TO THEIR SCHOOLS. Do something NOW to keep my students safe and to keep their transit expenses down.\n"

The proposed Bill 212 would severely limit my municipalities\u2019 ability to protect all road users, fight climate change, and ease congestion.\nBike lanes allow more people to travel in less road space, and municipalities know best what their integrated transportation needs are for their residents. Stop interfering and creating yet more red tape that you supposedly promised to reduce. And STOP building more unnecessary highways that will do nothing but cause more emissions that our environment cannot afford.  Heard of the escalating climate emergency?\n"

        "comment": "Subject: Reconsideration of Bike Lane Removal: Conservative Perspective on Policy and Political Implications\nDear Minister,\nI am writing to express my concern regarding the recent decision to remove bike lanes in Ontario. I am a suburban 905-Conserative voter. I recognize the importance of prudent government spending and maintaining infrastructure that supports Ontario\u2019s economic growth. However, I believe this decision, while perhaps intended to streamline traffic flow and address immediate road maintenance concerns, may lead to unintended, long-term political and financial consequences.\nEmbarassingly, the \"1.2% of people who bike\" statistic is brutally wrong and is on the brink of misinformation, and this error is making humiliating waves across social media.\nFirstly, removing bike lanes risks alienating a significant portion of Ontario\u2019s urban and suburban populations who view bike lanes as vital for safe and environmentally conscious transportation. Urban and suburban centers across Canada and globally have increasingly recognized that dedicated cycling infrastructure is not just a trend but a sustainable solution that can alleviate traffic congestion, improve public health, and attract businesses that prioritize sustainable practices. Dismantling this infrastructure may weaken Ontario\u2019s competitiveness, particularly in urban areas with younger, environmentally aware residents who prioritize such investments. This is a liberal-moderate standpoint at present, but in years time, you and I both know this will be valued among our youngest conservatives.\nFrom a political perspective, this decision could be counterproductive in expanding our voter base. As you may know, younger, environmentally conscious voters are increasingly becoming a crucial demographic, and many are drawn to political parties that advocate for sustainable and green policies. A 2022 poll by the Canadian Urban Institute found that nearly 65% of Ontarians under 40 consider bike lanes and pedestrian-friendly policies a priority in deciding their vote. This move risks alienating not only younger voters but also moderate conservatives and families who support a balanced approach to infrastructure that includes active transportation.\nFailing to adapt to these trends may hinder our party\u2019s ability to expand beyond its traditional voter base, particularly in urban centers. This could pose a challenge in future elections as other parties step in to champion policies supporting Conservative standpoints such as allowing people to live within their financial means, freedom of movement, freedom of choice, less red tape, further widening their appeal among these groups.\nI don't want the Liberals/NDP to win, and I don't want the PCs to lose voter favorability over time. I am worried what this decision may mean for the next election.\nThank you for considering this perspective. I hope we can find a way forward that strengthens our support without compromising on responsible infrastructure.\n"

        "comment": "This bill will slow down the completion of a useful and connected bicycle network that is safe for all riders in Toronto. Because the network is not complete and connected and fully safe, it has low usage. Because bicycles are considered to be a second-class form of transport, they do not have the safety they need to be a viable alternative. People need *more* choices of form of transportation, not less. Allowing bicycles to be a reasonable alternative to cars has seen widespread success all over the world.\nThis bill would set a terrible precedent for the future of Ontario.\n"

        "comment": "I am a university student in Toronto who has lived here my whole life. This idea is dangerous, stupid and an absurd waste of money in a time when our healthcare system (one of the increasingly few things that makes me proud to be Canadian) is stretched so thin. Cars are an inefficient way of transporting people when such a large percent of them contain a single occupant during workweek commuting. The subway and bike lanes move people faster, safer, and cheaper. The fact that this is even being suggested is patently absurd considering this is clearly a municipal responsibility, and the people of Toronto voted in Mayor Olivia Chow who has made her pro-bike lane stance very clear. Biking on busy streets without bike lanes is dangerous, and forcing cyclists to take side streets (which are hardly safer) shows that they are viewed as less than car drivers, who are a very loud minority. Regardless of the climate impact of this, this will result in cyclists being killed. Not might. *Will*. As someone who cycles downtown and has friends who cycle downtown, this proposal is a massive waste of money that could be better spent on the healthcare system than tearing down people centric infrastructure to be sacrificed on the altar of the all-mighty automobile.\n"

        "comment": "I don't believe that removing bike lanes will do anything to ease congestion. Is there any proof it would? Any studies? Has this worked in other cities? Construction is a major contributor to city traffic. Will you be banning construction sites from taking up lanes on major arteries? How about the 401? No bike lanes, but it's always slow. It's been suggested that allowing big rigs and commercial vehicles to use the 407 without charges would alleviate traffic on the 401. Have you considered that?\nThe fact is that bike lanes save lives. Where do you think the bikes will go once the lanes are gone? They're gonna be in traffic. The world is moving beyond a car-centric model. Why should Ontario move backward?\nAlso, the cost of removing the lanes, and the traffic it will cause, is far worse for drivers than just leaving the bike lanes. This decision makes no sense and will be a tremendous waste of money. I for one don't want my tax dollars going toward moving backwards.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express serious concerns about the proposed framework regarding municipal bike lane approvals and specific removals in Toronto. This proposal appears to disregard extensive research and data on urban transportation safety, economic benefits, and climate goals.\nKey concerns:\n1. Contradicts Evidence on Safety\n- Multiple studies show protected bike lanes reduce injuries and fatalities for ALL road users\n- Toronto's own data from Bloor Street shows a 73% reduction in conflicts between all road users after bike lane installation\n- Research from New York City found protected bike lanes reduced injury crashes by 40% for all road users\n2. Ignores Economic Benefits\n- Business studies on Bloor Street showed customer spending increased after bike lane installation\n- Merchants on streets with bike lanes report higher retail sales compared to comparable streets\n- Protected bike lanes increase property values and attract new businesses\n3. Undermines Municipal Authority\n- Cities need flexibility to manage their transportation networks based on local needs\n- This framework overrides evidence-based local decision-making\n- Municipal governments are best positioned to understand their communities' transportation needs\n4. Conflicts with Climate and Transportation Goals\n- Both provincial and municipal climate action plans call for increased active transportation\n- Removing bike lanes will increase car dependency and emissions\n- This contradicts Ontario's own stated goals for sustainable transportation\n5. Disregards Public Health Benefits\n- Active transportation infrastructure promotes physical activity and better health outcomes\n- The Canadian Medical Association endorses protected bike lanes as a public health measure\n- Removing bike lanes will have negative impacts on community health and wellness\nThe existing bike lanes on Bloor, Yonge, and University Avenue have proven successful through:\n- Increased cycling volumes\n- Reduced collision rates\n- Improved business activity\n- Enhanced street vitality\n- Better access to local businesses and institutions\nRather than removing successful infrastructure, we should be building upon these achievements. I strongly urge the province to:\n1. Withdraw this proposed framework\n2. Engage with municipalities and transportation experts to develop evidence-based policies\n3. Support municipalities in expanding, not removing, safe cycling infrastructure\n4. Align provincial policy with climate, health, and safety goals\nThis proposal appears to prioritize single-occupancy vehicles over proven safety measures and sustainable transportation options. I respectfully request that the province reconsider this approach and instead work with municipalities to enhance, rather than restrict, their ability to build safe, sustainable transportation networks.\n"

Even if you can add another car lane because of this, those extra cars will take disproportionately more space than the bike lane did. Please help keep as many people as possible on bikes so that those of us who need to be in a car are not drowning in traffic.\nThat bikes takes less space than cars speaks for itself, but i am attaching a study and an article with pictures if reference is needed.\n"

        "comment": "As a resident of Toronto who regularly commutes using the Bloor, University, and Yonge St bike lanes, I strongly oppose this legislation. Using a provincial bill to mandate the removal of municipal bike lanes is gross overreach. Furthermore, the province has provided absolutely no data to support the removal of these bike lanes. Studies around the world have shown that bike lanes reduce congestion by offering a safe alternative to driving. If the province removes these bike lanes, the people using the lanes won't simply disappear. Cyclists will take the lane instead, which slows down traffic even further. As well, some may choose to drive instead, further adding to congestion. These bike lanes are perfectly functioning infrastructure that the province wants to remove without producing a shred of evidence that such a move will improve anything.\nI also strongly disagree with the section of the bill that would require municipalities to receive approval from the Minister of Transportation to build new bike lanes. It is hypocritical to make municipalities meet obscure criteria to build new bike lanes while mandating the removal of Toronto bike lanes without any evidence. This bill would introduce unnecessary red tape and provincial interference into a process that should be kept at the municipal level. The reality is, continuing to build car centric infrastructure will set us back hundreds of years in terms of urban development. There is simply no way that Toronto will be able to handle a growing population by continuing to only subsidize car centric development.\n"

I am simply trying to be economically prudent and live within my means so that I can advance my career. Owning a car is just another expense that this government is forcing on me, only a few short years after gutting OSAP and removing tuition tax credits.\nWhile I currently live in Sudbury, I have lived in both downtown Toronto and Waterloo. This bill adds extra red tape and eliminates the authority of my local representatives. Why should people in other communities get to override my local vote on local issues? Not to mention the waste of public funds, removing infrastructure that was so recently and popularly installed across Ontario. This is not financially prudent.\nWhile I currently only bike and use public transit, I have driven frequently in the past. I feel much better when bikes are not sharing space with me while driving.\n"

        "comment": "This initiative is not based on facts, data or commonsense.\nWhile traffic in the city area is very challenging for those who want or need to drive cars and trucks, the proposed solution of removing bike lanes to slightly widen a few roads, and prohibiting narrowing of any further roads to provide a safe space for bike traffic will not achieve the objective stated.  Traffic is bad because there are too many cars in the city.  This will get worse as the city increases population density.  A \"commonsense\" solution is to strategize on getting people where they want to go without using a car.  This would involve strengthening and reinforcing the transit system, and provide safe routes for people who use scooters, e-bikes and regular bikes.\nThe City of Toronto has done much research on where to place bike lanes, and joins other progressive cities, including New York and Paris, in promoting cycling in the city.  Every person on a bike is a person not in a car.  That makes traffic BETTER for those in cars.  Many people do not bike because it is not safe.  They stay in their cars, making traffic worse.  Provide them with a safe bike lane network to get where they want to go efficiently, and they will get out of their cars, leaving more room for those who have no option but to use a motor vehicle.\nWhile this legislation is counter-productive, it is also plain dangerous to the very many individuals in the city who use bikes as their main transportation.  These are the \"regular folks\" the PC party likes to say it is looking after.  \"Regular folks\" like young adults who can't afford a car, or people who work in the city delivering goods.\nPlease do better.  This is overreach of the provincial government into municipal affairs.  It is harmful to the city, harmful to the thousands who use non-motorized vehicles, and to boot, will waste millions of dollars in removing the installed infrastructure.    Money will be wasted. More cyclists will be killed. Traffic will continue to be terrible in the city.\nI suggest you help with getting the Eglinton Crosstown completed, or work on improving bus service in the city, or think on other ways you can help people get from point A to B without a car.  These things are much more likely to fix traffic in the city.\n"
