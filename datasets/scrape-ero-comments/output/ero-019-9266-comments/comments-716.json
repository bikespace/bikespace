        "comment": "It is a ridiculous waste of taxpayer money to remove bike lanes that have just been constructed. Never mind the enormous, unnecessary cost, we need bike lanes. Our city needs multiple, viable forms of transport available. We need to invest in sustainable ways to get people across our growing city. It is already hard to get around and more construction to remove bike lanes along with the added lack of infrastructure resulting from their removal will negatively impact our city, accessibility, and will set us back 20 years in our growth.\nLeave our bike lanes as they are. A lot of people use and need them to get across our city. As a driver and TTC rider myself, I see the importance of having accessible, safe bike lanes. More lanes for cars will not solve the problem. We need to be able to control the flow of traffic by giving people good options to get around.\nTo remove bike lanes and not continue to expand their reach is wasteful, myopic, and generally an incredibly irresponsible move.\n"

I don't know what to say about it, because I know this office, the legislative committee, as well as the Premier's and Minister's offices have been flooded with data about the criticality of cycling in Toronto, and why this is such a terrible and ignorant move. Why should I repeat this, when the government is ignoring it, and ramming this through without any thought or research?\nI am beyond dismayed that the government ignores all this information, and has provided NO evidence at all justifying this move. I watched almost the full Nov. 18 committee meeting. Deputant after deputant presented deeply researched information, referencing studies around North America and the world with *facts* about cycling, and bike lanes' impacts on congestion, local businesses, safety (deaths will be certain with this bill), climate change. People noted evidence that all recent apartment and condominium buildings built in central Toronto, and near transit are built with vastly more bike parking than for cars - because that's who lives in those places.\nSafety gets no mention from the government, except to claim \"safe side streets\" can be used. This is a non-starter, those streets are utterly impractical to use when they exist, and there are *no* side street alternatives to Bloor & Yonge, and likely for other streets where the province will prevent future lanes. Again, whoever is pushing this bill knows nothing about cycling, and/or chooses to ignore all evidence.\nShame, shame, shame. People will die. Toronto and other Ontario cities will be dragged back to the 1950s and 60s when cities are dedicated to the car.\n"

They will now be riding in traffic and slowing down traffic further, putting everyone in more precarious situations. It is not worth the money to rip up *existing infrastructure*. You will create more traffic in both the short- and long-term. Bike lanes are municipal territory.\nThe only way to survive climate change is to reduce carbon emissions (from vehicles), and these bike lanes will be rebuilt, causing even more traffic. The bikes and subway eliminate high emissions options and drivers (who are not more important than other citizens) can take other routes in addition to the ones with bike lanes. Without these bike lanes, what are the alternate routes planned for the bikers, who also pay taxes?\nOur population is growing; car capacity cannot grow infinitely, however transit and bike lanes are underused and are the solutions to move mass numbers of people around. Unfortunately, the streetcars are stuck in car traffic, making it slow. The private properties of parked cars take up public street space in their storage.\nI don\u2019t know if there is anything I can say to convince the Ford government that the people they serve are more important than their own interests. In their pursuit of profits, they have actively made Ontario a worse place for everyone outside of the cabinet.\n"

The proposed plan to remove existing bike lanes and require provincial approval for the implementation of bike lanes where a lane of traffic is reduced is nonsensical, dangerous, and a provincial overreach.\nThe Premier and the Minister of Transportation have framed this as a way of reducing congestion, which is laughable. Anyone can see that the reason for congestion in the city is TOO MANY CARS. Bicycle lanes simply do not cause congestion in Toronto. Perhaps if Mr. Ford took public transit in to Queen\u2019s Park, which is literally across the street from a subway station, he wouldn\u2019t be so consumed with this pro-car, individualistic agenda.\nCyclists are vulnerable road users, and bike lanes keep them safe. Cyclists continue to be injured and killed in Toronto and across Ontario. Bike lanes allow cyclists to be safely seperated from vehicular traffic, and unimpeded by vehicle congestion. The fact of the matter is, if bike lanes are removed, cyclists will have to merge with traffic, and people will get hurt. People will die. All so that Bloor, Yonge, and University can have a vehicle lane back, to bring more cars to our city and make the congestion even worse.\nThese are municipal affairs and the province ought not to overreach like this. The city of Toronto decided to make these bike lanes happen and put in a lot of time, money, and effort for it. It\u2019s absolutely absurd that the province would spend $48 million to rip them up when we don\u2019t want him to.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly disapprove of removing any bike lanes anywhere. Bike lanes make cyclists safe, and help ensure pedestrian safety as well. It makes vehicle drivers more aware of other road users. In order to achieve traffic reduction, we need to move drivers onto bikes and other forms of transportation (transit) or walking, and bike lanes help achieve that. For every cyclist, there is one less driver on the road, and thus less traffic congestion. Cyclists have been striving for years and in some cases decades to achieve safety on the roads. To take it away on a whim because of a desire to create a wedge issue to help with an (unnecessary) early election is breathtakingly cynical and frankly stupid. The Premier himself said in 2017 that bike lanes help ensure fewer deaths on the roads. \"One death is way too many when it comes to bicycle riders.\" I could not agree more Mr. Premier. So stop this lunacy and keep the bike lanes. And stay in your lane instead of trampling all over municipal jurisdiction. If the federal government did that to the province, you would scream bloody murder. Have a care for doing that to other levels of government. If the people don't like what is happening in their towns and cities, they will remove their elected representatives through the democratic process. I also do not want my tax dollars being wasted on removing lanes that cost a lot to install. What a waste of money! Better to spend it on health care, more doctors and nurses, and new schools. We have lots of needs. Removing bike lanes is not one of them. In addition, the province should not have any right to approve the installation of new bike lanes. Leave it to the right level, the municipality.\n"

        "comment": "This is a plea to save my life.\nCycling is my primary mode of transportation in Toronto. I cannot afford a car and public transit often takes much longer than cycling. I have been hit by a car and have had countless \u201cclose calls\u201d with cars when I\u2019ve had to cycle on roads without bike lanes, such as Church St or University Ave before the bike lanes were installed. Removing bike lanes won\u2019t decrease the number of cyclists in the city; in most cases we have no alternative mode of travel. Instead, it will force cyclists to ride in the road with cars. This will, of course, frustrate drivers, which, we\u2019re being told, is a more pressing concern than our safety and the very problem Bill 212 is seeking to fix.\nThe Highway Traffic Act states that cyclists must leave at least 1 metre between themselves and the curb while cycling, and can take up the whole lane when the road is too narrow or when there are obstacles. Despite this, whenever I have to cycle in the lane with cars because there is no bike lane, cars honk at me, drivers yell at me, and some try to push me off the run. What is your government\u2019s plan for to educate drivers on cyclists\u2019 right to take up space when forced to cycle in the lane with cars?\nI understand very well that you don\u2019t care about me or my life. But please consider the economic argument for why I deserve to live:\nby remaining alive, I contribute to the economy. If I am struck by a car and killed, there will be administratively costly police reports and court proceedings. If I am struck and seriously injured, I will also become a drain on the public health care and social systems (even worse!). By cycling, I remain active and healthy, reducing my burden on the public health care system. Cycling will keep me healthy as I age, ensuring I remain able to work for as long as possible. Finally, as more cyclists die following the enactment of Bill 212, the public will begin to question why they valued convenience over safety, and point the finger at you. I hope I live long enough to see that.\n"

To cycle around the city safely, it requires time and effort to plan what route to take, and when best to cycle to have the least interaction with cars.\nIn its current state, there are still NOT enough connected cycling paths to get around the city safely, but in the past year, it has improved significantly with the implementation of additional and more robust bike lanes. Knowing these bike lanes exists provides more confidence to us cyclists, made travel time more predictable and less planning effort is needed.\nBill 212 is effectively sidelining an entire population who do not drive, whether it\u2019s because they do not know how to drive or that they do not have access to a car.

I am strongly opposed to building Highway 413 as it is a grossly irresponsible use of my tax dollars, to build another highway which will not ease congestion, while saddling the Ontario province with maintenance obligations for decades to come. The project will take years to complete and we will not see any effect on congestion until then. In fact congestion will get worse simply due to construction. The only real way of easing congestion, are VIABLE ALTERNATIVE MODES OF TRANSIT. If the only infrastructure and investment is for cars, this creates a feedback loop where everyone is forced to drive, which increases congestion, which forces more investment in car infrastructure while reducing spending elsewhere, which forces more people to drive ad infinitum. We need more public transit! Finish the Eglinton Crosstown LRT, Finch West LRT, expand Bus routes and frequency, add significantly more bicycle infrastructure, and people will use them. The more people that take public transit, the less people will be in cars causing traffic. These solutions are quicker to implement, cost less, are incremental, and results will be visible a lot sooner than creating yet another highway. On top of that, any provisions meant to sidestep environmental concerns are morally reprehensible.\nSchedule 4 has been contentious, and I vehemently oppose it. All arguments against bike lanes I have heard from Doug Ford or Prabmeet Sarkaria the transportation minister are short sighted, uninformed at best, and pure disinformation at worst. When they cite that few people commute by bike, they don't consider the fact that there are very few bike lanes in the city to be able to commute in the first place. If there were no roads at all, how many people do you think would commute by car? Unprotected bike lanes, lack of enforcement from police when people park their cars in the bike lanes makes it so much more dangerous for cyclists. This discourages bicycle use, and poses a huge safety risk. Many cyclists die on the road due to lack of good safe bicycle infrastructure. Removing what little we have would be disastrous! Every person that is currently using the bike lane to commute will either start cycling in the car lanes, or will switch to using a car, both of which will ADD to the existing congestion!\nDoug Ford is against red-tape, yet why is the provincial government adding more red tape to Municipal matters like installation of bike lanes? This costs tax dollars for the city and the province to go back and forth with approvals. Let the cities govern themselves!\nPlease stop the partisanship, look at the decades of research in the world outside of North America, and conclude that neglecting public transit and cycling infrastructure while wasting money on highway expansions and other car infrastructure will lead to an Ontario that is unbearable, unaffordable, and unequitable.\n"

Having just spent some time in NY where bike lanes are on most busy major streets, I feel embarrassed that my city (actually not my CITY, rather the PROVINCE, under Ford) is taking a giant leap backwards in road safety.

Bill 212 is clearly not an evidence-based approach to congestion because it goes against all of the evidence. Bike lanes are good for safety and good for business. More lanes for cars do not reduce congestion; increasing transportation options does.\nI have been cycling in Toronto for decades and I have seen an unprecedented surge in the use of bicycles and micro-mobility devices in the last five years. Many bike lanes are congested! Wayne Gretzky has been quoted as saying, \u201cI skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been.\u201d That is what we need to do to tackle congestion. People are adopting bicycles and micro-mobility devices as their preferred mode of transportation at a rapidly increasing rate. We need to prepare our streets for that.\nA much bigger problem for our streets, sidewalks and bicycle lanes is that a large portion of the micro-mobility devices are completely illegal for use on public property. Electric Scooters and unicycles are everywhere, but they are not legal on streets, sidewalks, recreational trails, or bike lanes. Even the current e-bike legislation doesn\u2019t adequately account for the diversity that currently exists. We urgently need legislation to clarify what is allowed, where it\u2019s allowed, and how fast it can go. People want to use these devices.

Recently added bike lanes and protected bike turning lanes have improved my safety on the road. Biking on a road without a bike lane often involves a few motorists passing me too close for comfort. When this happens, I am forced to bike closer to the centre of the lane, preventing motorists from passing me in that lane at all. This slows down traffic as much as the removal of a car lane AND causes uncertainty, stress and danger to everyone involved. I also drive a car regularly and feel much more comfortable being able to pass cyclists while they are safely in a bike lane!\nWhen car lanes are removed to add bike lanes, this often also includes addition of a centre left turn lane, which streamlines traffic and prevents much of the slow-down people fear from the removal of a lane. Local municipal planners and local citizens know what the best alternatives are for their city, not the province.\nRealistically, even the addition of car lanes will NEVER keep up with the increase in traffic caused by an ever-increasing urban population. No matter how many lanes of traffic you have, you're still in traffic. You still have to stop at red lights and you still have to watch for pedestrians. The ONLY way to avoid traffic is to move people from cars to bike, foot and mass transit. Making cycling and walking safer is a major part of this transition as well as would be investment in fast, safe, reliable public transit.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly disagree with and do not support this bill. My greatest concerns are:\n-If the province plans to monopolize the planning of how public right-of-ways are used, how does it plan to protect road users besides motor vehicle drivers? Specifically, how does the province plan to concretely prevent drivers from passing cyclists with little or no space (knowingly or unknowingly), prevent drivers from using their vehicles to threaten and harass cyclists (i.e.: \"penalty passing\", \"brake checking\"), and to generally prevent injurious and deadly collisions? These are things that are universally and regularly experienced by people who cycle in mixed traffic, no matter how they conduct themselves nor how regularly they cycle. Bike lanes provide a reliable and (sometimes literal) concrete refuge from these issues by creating a barrier between cyclists and drivers who subscribe to the extremely aggressive, overly opportunistic, and entitled driving culture that is common in the Golden Horseshoe.\nWhat alternatives to bike lanes does the province plan to use to ensure motor vehicles operate at slower, less dangerous speeds? Does it plan to provision more funds or OPP officers to provide more traffic enforcement? Does it plan to install more automated traffic enforcement? Does the province plan to install CCTV systems to monitor driver behaviour? Does it plan to provide alternative physical means (like textured pavement, speed bumps, bollards, etc.,)? Or a combination of all of these options? Many of these are more expensive or complex than the current solutions that the city has adopted.\nWhat viable alternatives to bike lanes does the province plan to use to separate cycling traffic from motor vehicle traffic? Will it expropriate land and demolish houses to create new bike highways adjacent to Bloor, Yonge, University, and other corridors?\n-If the province plans to continue its trend of altering and overriding municipal affairs (e.g.: reducing Toronto city council via Notwithstanding clause, MZO's, this current proposal), what role do municipal politicians have in representing their constituents? How can municipal governments provide unique solutions for their distinct communities if the province continues to veto their decisions? This does not promote trust in government, especially in this case where there has been decades of advocacy and hundreds of thousands of votes for city councilors and mayors who supported the installation of these lanes.\n-How does the province plan to create, retain, and expand the vibrance of urban areas? What criteria will it use to decide what areas are allowed to become \"revitalized\" in the future? This legislation creates unnecessary red tape for municipalities whose residents want to create more human scale spaces or more pedestrianized areas within their cities. Pedestrian friendly areas that have seen booming popularity like Roncesvalles and the Harbourfront in Toronto, which were both 4 lane throughfares until 2009 and 2015, will be harder for municipalities to recreate going forward. This limits opportunities for business, tourism, real estate, and tax base growth, never mind the livability and community these areas foster.\nWhile biking, I'm tired of being made to feel like I'm going to die just because someone in a car is in a bad mood or is on their phone. It's frustrating and disheartening that I may lose the ability to avoid that  ostensibly due to trivial motivations. This is not the city of the 70's and 80's that my parents grew up in and left. I hope that the livability and vibrance of a city and the safety of its residents takes precedence over a mild potential increase in convenience for a specific method of transportation.\n"
