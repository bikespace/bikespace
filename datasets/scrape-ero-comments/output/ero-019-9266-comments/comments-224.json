        "comment": "As a Toronto resident, I am appalled at the provincial government's approach to this issue. Premier Doug Ford shows that he either does not understand or does not care about the complexity of the transportation problems in Toronto and how it effects Toronto residents and visitors. This provincial overreach seems to be specifically targeted at Toronto. Municipalities are best positioned to determine infrastructure needs for their community, not the provincial government. Doug Ford stepping in to specifically target Toronto appears to be motivated by a combination of ignorance, spite, and stupidity.\nPrioritizing cars and out-of-town commuters to ensure that a precious few minutes are saved in traffic ignores the multitudes of studies support their use. Studies have shown that bike lanes reduce congestion by providing a safer environment for more drivers to switch to biking and have a net-positive effect that benefits drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians. For one such study see Monsere et al.'s (2014) \"Lessons from the Green Lanes: Evaluating Protected Bike Lanes in the U.S.\" which showed that no collisions or near-collisions were observed after installing protected bike lanes and 75% of residents supported building more of these lanes. In Toronto, we have seen that removing bike lanes is much costlier than installing them, and the stated goal of reducing traffic has proven to be false.\nMany municipalities see the value in bike lanes and yet Ford has his sights set on dismantling Toronto's exclusively. Why is that? The majority of Torontonians, even those who don't bike, support these lanes. I infrequently bike, but when I do, I am acutely aware of how dangerous it is. This was made evident after being hit by a car last month. I am even more cautious now about biking in the city. I have to say I am quite perturbed that politicians think it is wise to waste money and resources to dismantle bike lanes. However, it is not surprising considering the illogical decision of costing taxpayers $225 million to enable convenience stores to carry alcohol. It makes us wonder exactly what is motivating these types of decisions which cost our province money and show little (or no) benefit to anyone outside of Doug Ford\u2019s social and business circles.\nIf Ford continues on this short-sighted vendetta he has against Toronto, he will be doing this great city and its residents a disservice. We have a vibrant, beautiful, and cultural centre that attracts tourists and business from the entertainment industry. We see celebrities like Arnold Schwarzenegger hopping on city bikes to enjoy Toronto's sites. We do not need more cars on the road, we need less. Gridlock traffic is not because of bike lanes. We need to find ways to reduce the number of cars on the road, not take away safe transportation alternatives. Politicians should be relying on qualified individuals in city planning and transportation, rather than allowing their emotions and ambitions to rule their judgement.\nWe have very real concerns that need attention when it comes to transportation, such as problems with the Gardiner Expressway and the debacle that is the Crosstown LRT. If Doug Ford actually wants to reduce gridlock and save us time in transportation, perhaps he should actually address the root causes rather than waving false flags that have already been debunked. Is this simply a diversionary tactic to distract Ontarians from the ineptitude of our corrupt provincial government that has handed out sweetheart deals to crony capitalists? Is this rhetoric meant to appeal to a constituency of voters who commute into Toronto from the 905 area and like to blame cyclists for traffic because they lack a basic understanding of the actual causes of traffic (construction, car accidents, bad drivers, illegal parking, etc.)? Why not decrease the amount of street parking if the premier actually cares about increasing lanes of traffic? Why not increase the cost of penalties for unsafe driving, which we seem to have noticed a sharp increase in? Why not focus on ensuring DriveTest centres are not handing out driver's licences to unqualified and dangerous drivers in an apparent scandal of bribery and greed that was facilitated by the privatization of this industry? Why not issue fines to drivers via new models of accountability that allow citizens to submit video/photo complaints of drivers who block bike lanes, park illegally, and violate traffic laws that endanger citizens?\nHow much is this study costing us in time, resources, and funds that could be better allocated to addressing the actual problems Toronto and other municipalities are facing and the real concerns Ontario residents have? How many more cyclists have to die for politicians to understand that this is not a game? We should be prioritizing human life over the greed and whims of politicians. We don't need beer in convenience stores, we don't need a luxury spa on Toronto's waterfront that allows a select few to profit, we didn't want the Science Centre to be closed prematurely and moved illogically, and we certainly don't want to see Ford and his pals getting away with corrupt behaviour that saw the Greenbelt scandal unfold. Municipalities have spent millions of dollars to assess and develop strategic plans for safe transportation to meet increasing demands due to exploding population density. Yet Ford wants the power to veto decisions and remove bike lanes as he sees fit. We want safe transportation, accountability, and a focus on the key issues facing Ontarians. Stop getting in the way of municipalities doing their jobs and start working with the Federal government to address problems in housing and healthcare which Ontario residents demand immediate efforts be focused on. This is a waste of time and a distraction. We see you Doug Ford.\n"

        "comment": "Cars are the cause of congestion. Encouraging more driving is a losing strategy to reduce congestion. Instead of addressing actual issues and presenting proven methods of reducing congestion this bill will only increase it. Everyone, regardless of method of transportation, has places they need to be or would like to get to. There is a reason that bike lanes on main roads work, because it lets people opt to take a bike instead of a car. Cars are by far the least efficient use of space on our roads when everyone is forced to use one. Most cars are single occupancy as well. Creating a shared space for all, especially on main roads in a major city reduces congestion by taking people out of cars and onto transit (speaking of which the Crosstown LRT is STILL not open). If this government was actually serious about reducing congestion they would provide the support to municipalities and local governments to handle it, not this gross overreach of power into municipal issues. Toronto did not vote for this government. Therefore you should not be able to meddle in municipal affairs on behalf of the tourists from the subrubs that get offended at the sight of a bike. Not only that, those coming into the city should be encouraged to consider other means of transit to come into the city like our GO network and the TTC when their trip allows for it. This way, those trips that do need a car will actually be faster because there will be fewer cars overall. This is the wrong approach to reducing congestion. There are no bike lanes along to 401 or Lakeshore or the Don Valley Parkway, and yet they are still congested. Are you going to remove the non-existent bike lanes there to magically fix congestion there too? All world class cities have had to address traffic and bike lanes have helped every single time. I suggest you leave municipal issues to municipalities and stop forcing cities to become more hostile to the people that live there in favour of cars. Why doesn't our Minister of Transport, or the Premier take public transit instead of their single occupancy SUVs that take up an unnecessary amount of space on the road and to park. Save the car trips for when there is no other alternative. We have a subway station AT Queen's Park. Another note, bikes and pedestrians are better for business. Cars don't shop, people do. And the easier it is for people to stop along their route the more likely they are to shop. There is not enough land in the world for enough parking spaces to be available for drivers to be able to do the same.\n"

This has a lot of nonsensical feel-good vibes to it.  First off:\nBike lanes don't cause traffic. Cars cause traffic. Bike lanes are a solution to traffic, because they help people get around in other ways than in cars.\nThe last thing any of us should want is for people to be pushed out of safe, separated bike lanes and into street traffic, which will be the only option for many cyclists going to many destinations within the city. (This only makes sense if you irrationally hate cyclists.) More bikes on the street in regular lanes will interfere with the flow of car traffic much more than bikes in dedicated bike lanes. Destroying bike lanes, and taking away the city's control of planning and building bike lanes, will make traffic on Toronto's streets worse, not better.\nThere's also a real public safety issue. More bikes on the street means more collisions, and it means more cyclists will be injured or even killed. It will make cyclists less safe. By the way, cyclists are ALSO residents of Toronto, and they have a right to get around their own city in safety (again, unless one has an irrational hatred of cyclists).\nIf the government wants to reduce traffic, the solution is to fund the expansion of bike lanes, and trails and sidewalks for pedestrians, and to improve funding for public transit. More affordable, accessible, easy alternatives to driving a car means that many more people will use those options, reducing traffic for everyone. That would be the less fundamentally-idiotic option here, and would be a much more practical thing to spend money on than re-zoning the entire city to exclude bikes.  That's just reactionary mean-spiritedness dressed up as a real solution.\nIt's not.  It's not any kind of solution.  So please, just don't.\n"

Let's keep political intervention at the relevant level and on the relevant areas.\nThen, on the content on of this bill: All residents all paying for roads an infrastructure in Toronto, yet only a handful use big individual vehicles. Even without bike lanes and more car traffic, it will only be a small proportion of Torontonians using these streets. Whereas public transportation and bike lanes (as opposed to individual cars) help having more people move around in a more equitable way. In the context of climate change, energy scarcity and space scarcity, let's follow evidence-based solutions that many other cities are implementing successfully (Paris, France, just to name one): bike lanes are the way forward for better, more livable and sustainable big cities.\n"

Destroying bike lanes means turning more cyclists into drivers which adds MORE cars to the roads and causes MORE traffic. I would personally not be driving if I felt safer riding a bike and I do not believing making it more difficult for bikers to travel makes any sense if we're trying to reduce gridlock.\nIt is difficult enough to make any changes within the municipality for road infrastructure, and mandating provincial approval authority adds more red tape and bureaucracy to an already bureaucratic process.\nRoad infrastructure should be something that each municipality can study and understand themselves, not something that the provincial government should intervene with. Why should someone who might not even live in the city dictate how the city should structure its infrastructure? Someone from Ottawa or Toronto does not need to authorize whether a small neighbourhood in Milton can create a bike lane. Saying this is necessary is as nonsensical as someone from Canada dictating how streets in Paris should be designed.\n"

        "comment": "I DO NOT SUPPORT BILL 212\nMost fatal and serious injury bicyclist crashes occur at non-intersection locations. Nearly one-third of these crashes occur when motorists are overtaking bicyclists1; because the speed and size differential between vehicles and bicycles can lead to severe injury. Many people are not comfortable riding a bicycle because of their fear that this type of crash may occur. To make bicycling safer and more comfortable for most types of bicyclists, State and local agencies should consider installing bicycle lanes. Providing bicycle facilities can mitigate or prevent interactions, conflicts, and crashes between bicyclists and motor vehicles, and create a network of safer roadways for bicycling. Bicycle Lanes align with the Safe System Approach principle of recognizing human vulnerability\u2014where separating users in space can enhance safety for all road users.\nStudies and experience in U.S. cities show that bicycle lanes increase ridership and may help jurisdictions better manage roadway capacity.\nIn rural areas, rumble strips can negatively impact bicyclists\u2019 ability to ride if not properly installed. Agencies should consider the dimensions, placement, and offset of rumble strips when adding a bicycle lane.5\nBicycle lanes should be considered on roadways where adjacent land use suggests that trips could be served by varied modes, particularly to meet the safety and travel needs of low-income populations likely to use bicycles to reach essential destinations.\n"

The removal of the bike lanes is only going to increase the width of the road by feet at most which will not be enough to add extra lanes and if even if extra lanes are added I predict a build it and they will come situation where once the road is able to be used by more cars we will be in a worse congestion issue then we are now as more cars flock to the newly gutted streets.\nCyclists are tax paying citizens of Toronto just like drivers are. To tell cyclists that their chosen mode of transit that has proven to elliviate congestion, help the reduction of C02 emissions, create a quieter city and offere more options to move around the city, therefore removing congestion from the roads, the province is telling cyclists that they are not worth queen's park's time and their tax dollars will be used to remove something that is used by them on a daily basis.\nAs a tax payer of Toronto I am disheartened and insulted by the province's disregard toward people who choose to move around the great city of Toronto in a way other than a car. If you want to alleviate congestion on our roads then put the money that will be used to rip out already existing infrastructure into our public transit system instead and give Torontonians even more option to move around, thus removing the need for more cars altogether and solving the congestion issue simultaneously.\nKeep out of municipal issues Ford.\n"
