        "comment": "While I agree that traffic is a problem in the GTA, particularly downtown Toronto, we must look long term and make space for alternate forms of transportation. Our public transit expansions are for the most part long delayed and significantly over budget. We do not have enough room if all the new downtown inhabitants in the ever-expanding condo developments all drove cars. Give citizens alternatives - a far less expensive alternative would be allowing safe commutes on bicycle.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes make pedestrians safer: Bike lanes provide cyclists with a dedicated space, keeping them off the roads and away from pedestrian areas. This reduces the chances of dangerous encounters between pedestrians and cyclists, as the bike lane becomes the safer alternative to often congested roads or narrow sidewalks, which can be hazardous.\nBike lanes provide safety for bikes, scooters, and runners: A dedicated bike lane not only benefits cyclists but also enhances the safety of other road users such as scooter riders and runners. It reduces the risk of accidents by clearly delineating spaces for each mode of transport.\nMultiple studies show that bike lanes increase business activities:\nThe Green Lane Project (PeopleForBikes): This initiative found that bike lanes boost local businesses by increasing foot traffic and sales. In areas where bike infrastructure is improved, businesses report more customers and higher revenue.\n    The Economic Benefits of Bicycle Infrastructure (U.S. Department of Transportation): This study outlines how bike lanes can enhance local economic activity, especially in urban areas, by encouraging people to visit nearby shops and services more often.\n    Copenhagenize Design Company \u2013 Bike Lanes and Business Impact: Research from Copenhagenize shows that bike lanes can significantly boost business activity, especially in cities where cycling is already common, by attracting more cyclists to the area.\nCars, buses, and construction trucks cause even more congestion and danger: When bikes share the road with cars, buses, and heavy vehicles, the risk of accidents and fatalities rises. Not only do these conditions cause dangerous congestion, but they also contribute to environmental degradation. A shift to bike lanes can reduce congestion and save lives by separating these modes of transport.\nCity infrastructure shifting towards low-emission transportation is inevitable: Many cities around the world are already embracing sustainable transportation options. With rising concerns about climate change and air pollution, prioritizing low-emission modes like biking, walking, and public transportation is becoming increasingly essential. In fact, during peak summer heat, the heat generated by cars is no longer sustainable, making the shift even more urgent.\nThese changes require traffic lane removal: Implementing bike lanes and prioritizing low-emission transport often requires the removal of car lanes. This shift is already happening in many modern cities across the globe, which are ahead of Canada in transitioning to more sustainable urban planning practices.\nGetting rid of cars downtown is inevitable, but it must be done with the approval of all users. Affordable parking spots around the city, education for new cyclists and scooter users, and municipal and provincial consultation about traffic lane removal are essential to avoid antagonism and prevent frustration from all sides.\n"

I ultimately decided to get rid of my car 6 years ago and opt for a combination of ridesharing, transit and bicycling - both for convenience and to fulfill my commitment to benefit the environment. If we truly want to make a difference and be a leader in sustainability, we need to develop our biking and transit infrastructure - not tear it down. This proposal goes against what the citizens of Toronto want, and it should not be mandated by the provincial government.\n"

Ontario Government may have total disregard for data and evidence-based policy making but this measure of actually removing bike lanes goes way beyond that. It is a jurisdictional over-reach.

If you remove these lanes more people will die on these streets because of amount of accidents that will occur. This will also cause more congestion which seems to be the only thing he cares about. There are so many more logical solutions that would be more cost effective. Remove parking on these streets if you want more space. The people who bike mostly do not own cars, and more cars will just cause more congestion. You could also take the $200 of bribe money that you are planning to send out and make the 407 free for drivers. It's infuriating living in a province with a clown for Premier who has no logical solutions and only proposes ridiculous projects that actively hurt Ontarians. Invest in housing and healthcare. Care more about your actual constituants and less about your car. You make us all ashamed to live here.\n"

The Conservatives are once again ignoring evident and expert advice to pursue ideological goals and it is infuriating. As someone who lives in a city, who drives, cycles and walks, I can testify with experience that cars are the biggest problem on the road. It\u2019s hard to imagine this government adding to the ineptitude and corruption of the Ontario Place/Science Centre, the Green Belt, talk of boring a 50km tunnel under the 401, but clearly you don\u2019t care about the citizens/taxpayers of this province and only your donors. I truly thought the McGuinty government was corrupt but Doug Ford has opened my eyes to a whole new level of corruption.\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nAs a lifelong Toronto resident, I would like to remind Doug Ford that he is the Premier of Ontario, not the mayor of Toronto. Proposals like Bill 212 which directly impact the daily lives of Torontonians should not be imposed by someone who has never used a bike lane. I oppose removal of the bike lanes for the following reasons:\nWe know Doug doesn't care about facts or numbers, but separated bike lanes save lives, get more people out cycling and increase sales in business districts. They can even improve safety for drivers and pedestrians. Please see attached URL\nIt also makes absolutely no sense to give more lanes of traffic to major thoroughfares that already have an existing subway line directly under (Bloor and University).\nPerhaps before Doug decides to use our taxpayer dollars to rip up the lanes, he could use actual data to make decisions. Places like Portland will utilize bike counter programs (volunteer-powered effort, coordinated by the Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT)), that gathers valuable data about biking in Portland\u2014who is biking, where, and how it\u2019s changing over time. Please see attached URL.\nIf no one uses the bike lanes, sure, make a decision. But don't waste my taxpayer dollars to remove essential bike lanes that I used daily to get to my job in a hospital (where I am also underpaid, but that is another story). Thank you.\n"

        "comment": "As someone who bikes to my job regularly, I take advantage of these bike lanes. Congestion usually only really occurs for 1-2 hours a day, while bike lanes help protect cyclists year round. It seems ridiculous that we\u2019d try to get rid of bike lanes to increase capacity for 1-2 more hours, just to allow for more drivers to be able to come into the streets.\nJarvis and Sherbourne are great examples of comparable streets with different circumstances. Jarvis does not have a bike lane and faces congestion quite regularly. In the alternative, Sherbourne street has a bike lane, is one block away from Jarvis, and is rarely busy. This highlights that bike lanes don\u2019t cause congestion, vehicles do. Anything short of that is just a distraction to hide the true reason why we have congestion.\nP.S. Maybe opening the Eglinton line would help ease congestion. Just a thought.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes provide a safe, environmentally friendly and healthy way for people to travel across the city.  As the network expands more and more people are choosing cycling as a means of travel.  This positive momentum can continue to grow and make a huge impact on traffic, car pollution and the health of the city.    We have seen in several European cities (Copenhagen and Amsterdam) cycling can represent between one-third and one-half of all commutes.  It just takes time and a continued focus for Toronto to reap the same benefits of a robust and safe bike infrastructure.\n"
