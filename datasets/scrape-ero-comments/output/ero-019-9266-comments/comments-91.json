The province should not be allowed to interfere in the democratically supported infrastructure policies of cities. Bike lanes save lives. Bike lanes are good for the environment. Bike lanes are good for congestion. Bike lines are good for businesses. While almost everywhere else in the world is mandating bike lanes, this bill proposes removing them. Shameful.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes from these major roads in Toronto is an incredible example of a government not acting for the people. I am so incredibly disappointed that this is even an issue we have to fight for, removing existing, functional, valuable bicycle lanes in a vibrant and dynamic city. The essence and value of this city diminishes when you remove people\u2019s accessibility. How is this even up for debate!?! As a born and raised Canadian, I am incredibly disappointed. Please do better. Government should reflect the values of the people who live and love and die in this country; this proclamation by a man of questionable integrity and demonstrably little intellect is not reflective of that at all. My name is Milena, I stand by by statement\n"

        "comment": "This so-called \"Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act\" will do exactly the opposite for commuters like myself and many others in the city of Toronto.\nI depend on the presence of safe bike lane infrastructure to do my commute. Such bike lanes means I don't take have to add to car traffic. Removing bike lanes would increase gridlock for everyone and waste more of my time, the exact opposite of what this bill purports to provide.\nIf the government is truly interested in fulfilling the name of this bill, invest in transit, get Metrolinx in order (why is the Eglinton lrt so delayed), speed up road construction, reduce road blockages from building construction. Adding more lanes does not solve gridlock. There are many studies and examples that show this, so if this bill is a good faith attempt to solve the real problem of gridlock, it is approaching it in the wrong way.\nI expect the provincial government to defer to the local governments on such local matters as well. There are more relevant problems that my provincial tax payer dollars ought to be solving (healthcare, education) than this distraction from the real problems.\nGet your act together and stop going backwards with these proposals.\n"

        "comment": "There is literally no basis or data-backed studies that justifies the removal of bike lanes. I do not even bike, but know that the only way to reduce congestion is to provide viable alternatives such as biking and transit. The people of Toronto use bike lanes as a sustainable way to travel, and removing them will only force more people to use cars and increase congestion and pollution. Please listen to the data, and stop wasting tax payers' money by removing bike lanes that have already paid for, and reduce the traffic by improving our viable alternatives to driving.\n"

Cyclists are some of our most vulnerable road users and have a right to safely get around the city just like everyone else. Not to mention, making cycling a safer mode of transportation through the implementation of bike lanes increases its accessibility, thereby reducing the amount of cars on the road and improving congestion. I oppose the Ontario government playing any role in determining whether or not a bike lane can be established anywhere in the city of Toronto.\n"

This plan will NOT reduce gridlock and instead will lead to an increase loss of life of cyclists and pedestrians. Toronto is a major city, it should be a place that can fit the needs of all of the people who live here, and so many people use bikes and bike lanes to commute. It makes me feel safer - and I don't even bike regularly - to see my fellow community members use bike lanes for getting around. There is a bike lane on my street, on one to the north of me and on a larger street to the south - and nothing but positive things have come out of the lanes being there. This is an absolutely disastrous idea and I cannot support it in any way. It would mean terrible things for our cities. Please do not approve this bill, it is a death trap in the making.\n"

        "comment": "I am beyond frustrated by this proposed legislation. Induced demand is an evidence based principal at play here - if we create more roads, more people will drive cars, and within a short period, there will be the same level, if not worse, gridlock. If we create safe bike lanes, more people will cycle (and fewer cyclists will die commuting), and cycling will become a more publicly accepted means of transportation. The examples of cities like London have shown this to us, but instead, this proposal uses no evidence, is under researched and alarming. Toronto bike share data, and data from other cities in Ontario, show increasing ridership, more demand for cycling, but the province seems to be ignoring this.\nPremier Ford's comments on this bill, before it has even been read and passed, are indicative of a corrupt government that relies on feelings rather than facts.\n"

        "comment": "Gridlock is due to over-reliance on cars. The more space for cars, the higher the usage of cars. Bike lanes encourage people to cycle rather than drive, or to avoid driving in such areas and opt for walking or public transit. Look to other major world cities - Paris, London, Amsterdam, Rome, and more. These cities have large populations but far less space for cars, and far more space for bikes. Yet, they don\u2019t experience gridlock the way Toronto, New York, and LA do, because we all over-rely on cars. This government\u2019s refusal to accept the truth of the matter is purely due to its loyalty to car manufacturers and developers/construction companies. Please use your brains and not your wallets.\n"

        "comment": "-For a party of small government, the Ford government is sure sticking its fingers in a lot of government. Why should municipalities ask for permission to build on their land? I thought you wanted less red tape, not more.\n- Most of the gridlock and traffic happen on the highways. Traditionally there are no bike lanes on highways. Highway 401 is the busiest highway in North America, not \"Toronto\".\n- \"The Schedule enacts the Highway 413 Act, 2024. Section 2 of the Act provides an exemption from the Environmental Assessment Act for enterprises, activities, proposals, plans and programs for or related to Highway 413, including the Highway 413 Project and the Highway 413 early works projects. \" Climate change is real. Protecting the environment is more necessary than ever. When the province floods, do you think more pavement will save us?\n- Highways have been continuously adding lanes and yet we have never beat the gridlock. Have you considered a robust public transit system? Encouraging work from home? Encouraging carpooling? It seems like an obvious answer to gridlock is 'fewer cars', not 'more lanes'.\n"

        "comment": "My experience and the vast majority of available data leads me to urge you to reconsider the proposed legislation. Requiring municipalities to seek provincial approval for transportation infrastructure undermines the principle of subsidiarity, which emphasizes that decisions should be made at the most local level possible. Local municipalities, not the province, are in the best position to understand and meet the specific transportation needs of their communities.\nNumerous studies have shown that encouraging active transportation options like cycling and walking, coupled with strong public transit, is the most effective way to reduce congestion. In fact, research consistently highlights that cities with robust bike infrastructure experience not only less traffic congestion but also improvements in public safety and local economic vitality.\nA prominent Canadian urban planner has said that \u201cbuilding more roads just leads to more traffic.\u201d In contrast, cities that prioritize cycling and walking infrastructure see a meaningful shift toward sustainable transportation choices that benefit everyone.\nAs we face increasing challenges from climate change, prioritizing bike lanes and alternative transport options will be key to fostering healthier and more livable cities, while also addressing traffic and environmental concerns.\nInstead of restricting municipalities\u2019 ability to design streets that work for everyone, the province should support efforts to make cycling safer and more attractive, which ultimately reduces car traffic and congestion.\nThank you for considering this input.\n"
