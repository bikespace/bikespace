        "comment": "This proposal from Ontario is not just a misguided approach to managing traffic; it illustrates a glaring hypocrisy in the government's commitment to reducing gridlock while simultaneously erecting bureaucratic barriers that stifle the expansion of safe and effective bicycle infrastructure. By imposing stringent regulations and requiring municipalities to jump through hoops to create new bike lanes, the province is effectively discouraging active transportation options that could alleviate congestion.\nThe intention to \"fight gridlock\" is commendable but fundamentally flawed when pitched against the backdrop of reducing bike lane options. The notion that removing a bike lane would somehow benefit drivers is shortsighted. In reality, this approach will only serve to push more people into cars, exacerbating traffic problems rather than alleviating them. The simplistic idea that we can remedy gridlock by prioritizing car lanes over bike lanes ignores the growing body of evidence demonstrating that cycling infrastructure actually reduces the number of cars on the road.\nMoreover, the logic behind requiring municipalities to justify the existence of bike lanes speaks to a lamentable lack of understanding regarding the benefits of cycling for urban mobility. Cities that invest in safe cycling environments often find that these options encourage more people to choose bikes over cars, ultimately leading to less congestion. Conversely, taking away bike lanes means less choice for residents and a return to car-dependent transportation, which clutters our roads and diminishes the quality of urban life.\nBeyond all of this; this proposal becomes even more absurd when we consider that it is being championed by a conservative government, which traditionally advocates for limited government intervention and greater autonomy for municipalities. By imposing bureaucratic hurdles and centralized control over the creation of bike lanes, this administration is ironically overstepping the very principles it claims to uphold.\n"

Having safe bike lanes as an option for transportation is very important for many people for full commutes, commutes to transit stations, and for recreational use.  With more, *complete* bike infrastructure, it will be able to be used more.  If there weren't connecting, safe roads then less people would drive, yet somehow some people say not enough people bike ignoring that they aren't given connecting, safe routes.  We need more bike lanes, not less, and ripping up existing lanes is bad for people and is a waste of taxpayer money.\n"

Get the Metrolinx LRT systems up & operational!\nA government who claims to be safety cautious is blind to the facts of what the bike lanes provide!\nRemoving bike lanes will not fix city gridlock problems, it will however reduce the safety of cyclists and probably pedestrians too. We need to be moving to a state where there is a balance between the needs of a motorist and cyclists and pedestrians too. Removing bike lanes in areas where there are multiple modes of transportation is not the direction our communities should be headed. Motorists need to address the need to commute along routes where there is an availability of transit in abundance. The focus shouldn\u2019t be on the number of cyclists today and whether it warrants bike lanes, it should be on where we want to be in the future.\nBacktracking and living in the past will not address gridlock.\nThe government needs to fact check their data or least the source, because they are out of touch with world class cities/countries.\n"

        "comment": "I believe this bill is extremely shortsighted. Removing bike lanes is not going to decrease vehicle congestion in the long run while the city continues to grow at the rate it is. Cycling infrastructure and public transit infrastructure need time to develop and properly interconnect before people can fully transition to a car-free commute. The low ridership that is quoted when speaking about bike lanes in the city is heavily influenced by suburban populations that have no other choice than to commute by car because no other infrastructure exists in their area and ignores areas of the city with developed bike lane networks where ridership is 10-15% or higher. The best way to fight vehicle congestion is by taking cars off the road and the only way to do that and continue to support the growth this city is experiencing is by actively investing in public transit and cycling infrastructure, not the opposite. I ask that policy makers consult with urban design experts before making a decision like passing this bill. It seems to me to be more of an appeal by the ford government to a majority of car drivers to gain popularity while ignoring research and case studies that suggest cycling is hugely important in the long run to increasing quality of life and mobility in dense urban areas.\n"

        "comment": "I live near Bloor and The Kingsway, and I walk through The Kingsway daily. I rarely see congestion. Sure, there is congestion at rush hour, but there always has been and there always will be. Removing the bike lanes would only make it worse, and the bikes aren\u2019t going anywhere. More cars would mean cyclists would be forced to mix unsafely in traffic. As a driver, pedestrian, and cyclist, I know these bike lanes have made Bloor safer: the speed limit has been reduced and a new pedestrian walkway was added near Prince Edward Cemetery. Before the bike lanes and pedestrian walkway, people tended to jaywalk across two lanes of often speeding traffic.\nBike lanes aren\u2019t just a safety feature; they\u2019re critical for connectivity in our city. Without them on Bloor, crossing the Humber River by bike would become significantly more challenging, if not prohibitive. A detour through side streets would require navigating a steep hill\u2014an obstacle that many cyclists simply could not overcome. This lack of direct, accessible routes would hinder active commuting options.\nIn terms of broader impact, supporting bike infrastructure like the Bloor Street lanes isn\u2019t just about local benefits\u2014it\u2019s about the environment and creating a sustainable city. Studies have shown that cities with comprehensive bike lanes experience reduced carbon emissions, less air pollution, and healthier, safer communities. Removing bike lanes would send us backward, not forward, in tackling climate change and creating a city built around safety and common sense.\n"

        "comment": "I am opposed to the proposal for the province to give itself the power to remove bike lanes, which is and should remain a municipal issue.\nI am also opposed to the province removing existing bike lanes, in particular on Bloor St. This road is a key east-west artery that many people use to get around the city, whether in a car, on a bike, on foot, etc. Due to this road crossing ravines, railways, etc and the general layout of surrounding streets, there are not side streets that are viable alternatives for cyclists. I know this because I had to cobble together convoluted routes through side streets prior to these lanes being in place. Due to this reality we should share the space on Bloor St and consider everyone's needs, rather than focusing just on cars.\nBike lanes have not been shown to be the main factor creating congestion, so this proposal will not address the issue it claims to. Instead they create a safe environment where more people can choose to make more trips by bike over time. The province also is confusing the issue by using city-wide data for cycling statistics rather than looking at how many people bike in neighbourhoods well served by bike lanes, which is higher.\nOntario claims to be \"open for business\". However bike lanes have been shown to be good for local businesses along the route. They also facilitate bike-driven businesses such as food delivery. This doesn't seem to be a consideration in the discussion.\nI can't speak to the direct impact of this proposal on me since the exact segments being proposed for removal have not been shared. However there are portions of these bike lanes I use regularly to get to work, activities, visit friends, etc. Depending on which parts are removed, it could significantly derail my ability to get around in a safe, effective manner while also getting exercise and reducing car use.\nI urge the province to step away from this issue and keep it at a municipal level where it belongs.\n"

        "comment": "The Ontario government\u2019s proposed legislation to remove and restrict bike lanes in Toronto raises important concerns about governance, resource allocation, and the future of urban mobility.\nMunicipal Authority on City Infrastructure: Decisions about bike lanes and urban transportation should remain within the jurisdiction of municipalities, not the provincial government. Municipal governments are closer to their communities and better equipped to understand the needs of their residents. A government committed to \u201csmall government\u201d principles should respect local decision-making authority, allowing cities like Toronto to design and implement infrastructure that reflects the unique needs of their populations.\nHigh Costs of Repeated Infrastructure Changes: The constant addition and removal of bike lanes incur unnecessary financial costs. Funds spent on repeatedly reconfiguring roadways could be more effectively allocated towards maintaining and enhancing long-term infrastructure projects. Ensuring a stable and thoughtful approach to transportation planning is essential to minimize wasteful spending on temporary or reversible measures.\nPrioritizing Long-Delayed Projects: There are critical transportation projects, like the Eglinton Line, that have seen delays spanning over two decades. Resources should be directed towards completing these essential infrastructure projects rather than dismantling established bike lanes. Completing projects that have been stalled for years will provide tangible benefits for residents across the region, making better use of public funds and addressing existing transportation gaps.\nEfficiency of Bike Lanes in Urban Centers: In major cities like Toronto, bike lanes provide a fast, efficient, and sustainable means of moving people, often quicker than cars in high-traffic areas. I, and many others, prefer bike lanes over driving for precisely these reasons. Cities should be designed to prioritize the people who live in them, with a focus on affordable, accessible, and environmentally friendly transportation options. The majority of urban residents do not rely on cars due to high ownership and parking costs. Designing cities around car traffic not only excludes these residents but also promotes an outdated model of urban planning that ignores modern sustainability goals.\nCreating Inclusive Urban Spaces: Cities should prioritize the needs and preferences of their residents. Cars are costly, parking is limited, and the environmental impact of vehicle traffic is significant. By focusing on efficient public transportation and sustainable alternatives like cycling, we can create a more inclusive and forward-thinking city infrastructure. Planning for cars alone ignores the economic realities for many urban dwellers and excludes those who rely on active and public transportation.\nIn summary, I urge the Ontario government to reconsider this legislation and allow Toronto to make its own decisions regarding bike lanes. Focusing on completing overdue projects and respecting municipal authority would provide far greater benefits to Ontarians than reversing progress on sustainable transportation infrastructure.\nThank you for considering these points in your legislative process.\n"

        "comment": "I am worried about the removal of bike lanes in Ontario, and the introduction of more bureaucracy in the addition of new bike lanes. Climate change is happening and we need to reduce cars in our cities. We also need to make it so our cities are open to people who cannot drive (due to medical reasons, being children, etc.) and can be safely navigated by walking or bicycling. Adding additional lanes of cars makes it less safe for people walking or bicycling, and we have seen several deaths this year of cyclists.\nUltimately however, it is no longer a preference of someone wants to cycle, walk, or drive a vehicle. We don't have a choice. If every Torontonian drove everywhere they went, traffic would just get worse. We would need to build a highway on every street. It is just untenable. Toronto needs to come up with solutions that don't involve people getting into cars to move around the city. Aside from the benefits of cycling (exercise, good for the environment, fun, etc.) we also need to realize that we don't have another choice. We either live in bumper-to-bumper traffic, where the city needs to make special exceptions to big concerts (like Taylor Swift), or we embrace the future, which involves more than just cars to get around the city.\nI am a physician living in Toronto and commuting to many different hospitals, and I rely on our excellent bike infrastructure to do my work.

This government has a dated view on car culture. In this current moment where climate collapse is on our door step and social inequalities are significant, to actually care for the people, would mean investing in safe sustainable infrastructure  that is affordable for everyone to use. Increasing the running of Busses, trains between cities, creating more direct routes all have shown to lower the number of cars on the high way, in additions to lowering accidents. We need to be moving away from car culture not inflating it.\nHaving walkable accessible neighbourhoods in our cities has shown again and again how it is good for the economy and social health of a city. Safer bike lanes have been asked for by people of Toronto for decades, to prevent the numerous deaths and accidents to cyclists. They provide a clean safe way of moving around the city.

        "comment": "The stated, abstract objective of this Act is to reduce \u201cgridlock,\u201d using means which are proven to be detrimental to public health and safety, mobility and access to Ontario communities for all people, environmental protection, and will aid in worsening the ongoing climate emergency. The attack from the Ford Government on our bike lanes is an attack on the working class, our seniors and disabled community members, and every single community member who relies on safe roads in order to live their daily lives.\nDespite having the authority to do so per the Municipal Act, requiring provincial approval for construction of new bike lanes where they \u201creplace a lane of traffic\u201d is a dramatic overreach of government authority in the affairs of municipalities. This is meddlesome and suggests the provincial government doesn\u2019t have faith or trust in municipalities to manage their own affairs, and further suggests that the provincial government isn\u2019t interested in local democracy\u2014bike lanes aren\u2019t constructed without warning; they are built only after an extensive planning process, which includes considerable research and community consultation.\nFurthermore, it is an objective fact that more car lanes will not reduce traffic congestion: the concept of Induced Demand indicates that with more car lanes, there is more traffic. This phenomenon has been observed all over the world. If this government were serious about \u201creducing gridlock,\u201d it would be making investments to the tune of several billion dollars to prioritize development and construction of extensive transit projects all over the province, and would invest considerable time, money and effort into the construction of more, comprehensive cycling networks. One more bike on the road is one less car; bikes take up far less space on the road than a single occupancy vehicle, thereby making more room for those who are or who must drive.\nIt is important to mention as well that the three bike lanes Premier Ford has pledged to remove in Toronto also see thousands of users per day\u2014that\u2019s literally thousands of cars that are off the road as a result. Local businesses are more successful in areas with bike lanes (this is easily proven looking at the Bloor Bike Lane reports prepared by City staff in Toronto), and various Toronto BIAs have already come out in support of bike lanes and the detrimental impact their removal would have on local businesses.\nInstallation of bike lanes also have the added advantage of making the entire streetscape safer to use for all mobility modes; cars, bikes, pedestrians, and all others. Their existence can save the lives of cyclists and many others. Six cyclists have died on Toronto streets this year, and that is six too many; innocent lives lost because the victims were trying to get across town. Utterly senseless, with families shattered as a result.\nThis is also an issue of class. It is much more expensive to buy or rent a car than it is to buy or rent a bike/e-bike. Toronto and Ontario have to start making better policies and corresponding infrastructure for the burgeoning delivery workforce that uses bikes, e-bikes and scooters. The workforce is overwhelmingly immigrants and men of colour commuting in from the inner suburbs (Brampton, Mississauga, Scarborough, Richmond Hill). Removing bike lanes further marginalizes this population.\nOn the topic of exempting 413 lands from environmental assessments, this is yet another short-sighted policy that will result in disastrous outcomes for the environment. The area where the highway is intended to be built is environmentally sensitive land. Once paved over, that land is lost as a carbon sink, a natural habitat for native flora and fauna, and as a floodplain/natural flood control measure\u2014forever. The proposal that this highway should be exempted from any environmental assessment to expedite development suggests the government doesn\u2019t care whatsoever about the environment. Here, again, I must emphasize that if the government is serious about reducing gridlock, the only way forward is to invest in and build a massive public transit infrastructure, and augment municipal streets with alternative means of mobility, such as bike lanes.\nI question whether any planners, environmentalists, engineers or any other credentialed experts were consulted at all in the creation of this bill.\nIn summary, Bill 212 is a backwards approach to \u201creducing\u201d gridlock which will have the complete opposite effect of its stated objective: gridlock will become worse, public safety will be worse, local economies will suffer, the environment will be senselessly, irreparably destroyed, and health outcomes for Ontarians will be worse, which will end up costing us more. This bill should not move forward.\n"

Toronto has rejected him and yet he still seems to imagine that he\u2019s the mayor and keeps on intervening in ways that\u2019re very unwelcome. Now he has set his sites on our bike lane infrastructure, which has always been a municipal issue. He drives around in his SUV raging about the bike lanes, and he gets a few texts and calls on his personal cell phone from people who don\u2019t like them either, so he decides he\u2019s going to show us all how tough he is by ripping them out and orders the minister to make that happen. Doesn\u2019t matter what the real data shows about how many people use them and how important they are to the city, how they save lives and have a negligible affect on car traffic, he\u2019s going to do it anyway. It\u2019s a complete nonissue, just another useless initiative that the premier has come up with that helps no one and is just a waste of money. These 3 particular bike lanes at issue (on Bloor, Yonge and University) were built after years of planning and at great expense, and now the premier has decided that he knows better than all the city planners and duly elected councilors. The arrogance and ignorance on display here is staggering and infuriating. He knows nothing about bike lane infrastructure or city planning, doesn\u2019t ride a bike himself as he drives everywhere in his SUV, and now he\u2019s going to come crashing down on the city with such an arbitrary, destructive and unnecessary move such as this. It's a brazen act of vandalism against our city\u2019s cycling infrastructure and all part of the premier\u2019s implacable need to go after the downtown \u201clefties\u201d who don\u2019t support him. Removing these bike lanes isn\u2019t a priority for anyone else in the province, and yet he still puts his time and energy into something so useless and destructive as this pathetic scheme. The premier and the minister better present some real data and evidence to show that these bike lanes are actually slowing down traffic and causing gridlock, instead of just saying it over and over again and presenting nothing. Just because the premier says that the bike lanes are causing \u201cabsolute gridlock\u201d and \"bringing traffic to a standstill\" doesn\u2019t make it true. In fact there\u2019s no evidence supporting what they say and it\u2019s actually quite the opposite. The premier can try to frame this bill as \u201cgetting you moving\u201d all he wants but it isn\u2019t going to get anyone moving, it\u2019s only going to slow down traffic as the lanes are ripped out and lead to more accidents between cars and cyclists. The removal of these bike lanes has the potential to get people killed. The minister cited some dubious figures to justify this move, saying \u201c1.2%\u201d of commuters use bikes, which\u2019s just false and there\u2019s no way that\u2019s true. That data\u2019s from 2011, before the bike lanes were built, and it encompasses the entire GTA, large swaths of which have no bike lanes and few riders, rather than just Toronto, which\u2019s where we should be focusing on when talking about these 3 bike lanes that you\u2019re now targeting. Since 2011, there\u2019s also been a massive increase in food delivery couriers on bikes, e-bikes and Bike Share Toronto trips on the city\u2019s streets. So the minister\u2019s knowingly presenting bad, outdated data to mislead the people. He says it\u2019s \u201ccommon sense\u201d that the bike lanes should be removed, but it damn well isn\u2019t common sense when these bike lanes were only just built, some with very complex designs and at great expense, and they\u2019re very useful to a lot of people everyday, and now out of nowhere you\u2019re going to rip them out and waste a whole bunch of time and money in the process. The minister apparently commutes to work by car from Brampton, while he probably doesn\u2019t ever ride a bike either and has no use for bike lanes. What experience with or knowledge of urban cycling infrastructure does he have that renders him qualified to make these decisions? Because this is truly one of the stupidest initiatives imaginable, to rip out perfectly fine cycling infrastructure that was only recently built for no reason. I want to see the evidence that these 3 bike lanes are causing \u201cabsolute gridlock\u201d as the premier says. The premier\u2019s clearly lying here because there\u2019s no \u201cabsolute gridlock\u201d in the city. If there were then that\u2019d mean that nobody\u2019d be moving at all, and this certainly wouldn\u2019t be caused by a few bike lanes. Where\u2019re the studies and reports about how these bike lanes are negatively affecting car traffic? I don\u2019t take the premier\u2019s word for it, not at all, because he lies and exaggerates about everything. The CBC recently published an article online fact checking his various claims about bike lanes and showed it all to be false, everything he has said is factually wrong. The bike lane on Bloor St. is beautifully designed and working very smoothly. It\u2019s a masterpiece. There\u2019s room for two lanes of traffic for both cars and bikes and even room for parking. I use it regularly and I can tell you that it\u2019s a great piece of infrastructure for the city. It keeps cars and bikes separated and out of each other\u2019s way. What don\u2019t you understand about why that\u2019s a good thing? The Bloor-Annex BIA is trying to tell the premier and the minister in no uncertain terms that the bike lanes have been great for business on Bloor because people on bikes stop and buy stuff, while people in cars just drive on through. Is Bloor St. supposed to be merely a highway for cars or is it a street where people can stop and interact in the community? Why doesn\u2019t the minister pay a visit to the Annex neighborhood and speak to some of the business owners there and view the bike lanes in action? Instead of making such a blunt force arbitrary decision with no consultation with any of the local stakeholders. The minister says the province will \u201creimburse\u201d the city for the removal of the bike lanes. Well, they should also pay for the design work and installation of them because that was a very costly and time-consuming process. I for one hope that the city will refuse to have anything to do with this folly and will not cooperate in any way. The city should refuse to remove the bike lanes and then we\u2019ll see what the province can do about that. Because this is an outrageous intrusion into municipal affairs, and any directive coming from the province to remove the bike lanes should be ignored by the city.\n"

This is NOT only not \"common sense\" at all, it is a really BAD idea on all fronts. Bad for safety, bad for the environment / climate change, bad for traffic congestion, bad for citizens health, bad for businesses, bad for everyone and everything...\n"

        "comment": "I ask that the government reverse their decision to implement this act! Bike lanes actually help reduce traffic gridlock, imagine if all of those bike riders were on the street in cars instead. Well designed safe bike lanes on major roads encourage more people to choose not to drive, which is better for people using the road for whom it is necessary to use a car. As someone who works in downtown Toronto, I have driven through the proposed streets where the bike lanes would be removed both before and after the bike lanes were added, as far as I can tell traffic has stayed relatively the same. Encouraging alternative forms of transportation is also something we must do to ensure that climate change is mitigated as much as possible. As a young person, all my life I have been concerned about climate change and I have seen the situation get worse year by year. One thing that hasn't changed however is how much conservative governments in this country don't seem to care about this issue, or about the concerns of younger adults in general. I don't understand why the provincial government thinks they have any right to boss municipalities around. Especially when it seems that the government has crafted this act without considering urban planning research which likely would inform them about the importance and benefits of bike lanes.\n"
