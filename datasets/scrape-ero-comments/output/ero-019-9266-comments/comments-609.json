        "comment": "I'm writing to express my disgust and anger at Premier Ford's move to remove bike lanes and interfere in municipal matters. Removing bike lanes and requiring provincial approval for new ones is short-sighted, unbecomingly petty, dangerous and goes against plentiful evidence from Toronto and other global cities that find that cycling infrastructure improves safety, encourages more people to use a bike as their primary mode of transit and helps in the fight to lower greenhouse gas emissions and meet the world's climate goals. Premier Ford and Minister Sakaria's talking points that bike lanes worsen traffic and could lead to slower emergency response times are ideological garbage that are entirely unsupported by the facts.\nCity of Toronto data has found that streets with bike lanes saw only fractional increases in commute times for drivers, of one minute or less on average. There's quite simply no data that indicates making dedicated space on the road for cyclists is a hindrance to drivers. I might suggest that Premier Ford, who is notably targeting the Bloor bike lanes that intersect with his own commute to work, is just jealous to see cyclists zooming past him every morning. Perhaps if he got on a bike himself he might get to Queen's Park faster.\nFurthermore, Toronto's emergency services have repeatedly said that bike lanes do not hinder their response times, and the data proves this out. According to the city, emergency response times on Yonge Street \u2014 one of the streets with protected bike lanes Premier Ford is speciously targeting for removal \u2014 were 36 seconds less than the average citywide increase in response times. Paul Raftis, then-head of Toronto\u2019s paramedic service, told city council in 2022 there was \u201cno evidence of emergency response impacts as a result of the midtown installation.\u201d Further, at a public meeting in October, Toronto Fire Deputy Chief Jim Jessop told the meeting the fire department has not seen an increase in response times, based on international standards, in the last few years due to the bike lanes.\nDespite Premier Ford and Minister Sakaria's assertions, bike lanes may also contribute to reducing traffic by encouraging more people to ride their bike instead of take their car to work. According to a Toronto study of the city's two most popular bike lanes, cyclist volumes increased by more than 1,000 per cent in 2016 on some stretches compared to 2013, before lanes were installed, and 94 per cent of these riders were likely to be new cyclists shifting from car, foot or transit, rather than existing bike commuters pulled from other routes. If more drivers who also enjoy cycling have a safe, protected and speedy way to get to work, they'll take it, and that will remove more traffic from the road. (This also has an added benefit of significantly reducing GHG emissions: in Paris, thanks to the dramatic expansion of cycling infrastructure and closure of whole roads to vehicle traffic in favour of cycling, car ownership has fallen from 60% of city residents to 35% within the past two decades and the city's GHG emissions dropped by 20% in that time frame. Between 2020 and 2021 alone cyclist traffic increased 70%. Those policies, by the way, are WILDLY popular.)\nPremier Ford, for all he says he cares about reducing traffic, does not seem to be aware of the actual root causes of traffic in the city: ongoing construction projects, pandemic recovery, seasonal traffic shifts, and also important and much-needed traffic calming measures, including lower speed limits, that improve safety for vulnerable road users.\nRemoving bike lanes will endanger cyclists like myself. Toronto is already a scary place to be on two wheels: this year alone six cyclists have been killed by drivers, and a peer-reviewed paper by UK researchers examining Toronto Police Services and emergency department visits data found that between 2016 and 2021, more than 30,000 Toronto cyclists went to the ER due to road injuries. Every single day \u2014 and that is no exaggeration \u2014 I see Toronto drivers behave in ways that are highly reckless if not outright illegal. In the five years I have lived in Toronto I have personally witnessed multiple cyclists being hit or doored by drivers. While drivers often don't respect the bike lanes we do have, protected lanes are an important tool in keeping vulnerable road users safe. Premier Ford used to know this himself \u2014 when he went for a bike ride with Jagmeet Singh on TVO's Political Blind Date  in 2017, he expressed concern for the parts of his ride where he was unprotected by a bike lane, and vowed to keep cyclists safe.\nFinally, I would like to note that the Highway Traffic Act explicitly allows cyclists to bike in the middle of traffic lanes if it is not feasible or safe for them to keep to the right. On many Toronto streets, keeping to the right puts vulnerable road users between parked cars and active traffic \u2014 putting them at risk not only of drivers passing on their left but of being doored by drivers getting out of their parked cars who aren't paying attention, or hit by cars pulling out of their parking spots. Any reasonable cyclist would choose to take up the lane of traffic for their own safety. If Premier Ford thinks traffic is untenable now, just wait until cars are forced to slow to the speed of cyclists. Some food for thought!\n"

        "comment": "My thoughts on this proposal are overall negative. I will discuss why.\nFirstly, as a resident of richmond hill, my vote should have minimal effects on the residents of Toronto. The decision of what to do with yonge street, bloor street, or any other main streets in Toronto should be up to the municipal government of Toronto. The provincial government should stay out of it.\nSecondly, the proposal is to reduce gridlock by removing bike lanes. For the sake of discussion, it's important to note that gridlock is a phenomenon that happens when multiple intersections of a grid are blocked by vehicles. Gridlock is impossible if cars don't enter an intersection if there isn't room for them to clear the intersection without room on the other side of the intersection at the time of entering the intersection. Gridlock is caused by bad driving and can be punished with demerit points. We can also reduce the use of a grid pattern in locations highly susceptible to gridlock. Certainly, increasing the number of lanes increases the number of vehicles that can fit between two intersections, and thus decrease the likelihood of gridlock, but it's important to note that the cause is not the lack of space between intersections, but the lack of awareness in the driver's seats.\nThirdly, bike lanes increase safety and reduce accidents. Bikes are a vehicle that belong on the road, according to the highway traffic act. That means that, without a bike lane, the bikes are required to just get on the road, and motorized vehicles are required to keep a meter distance between them. It's logical then that a dedicated bike lane reduces the potential for collisions and accidents between motorized vehicles and cars. Without bike lanes, riding a bike becomes less safe, and increasing safety is how we reduce collisions.  This is ultimately why reducing bike lanes is a silly proposal. Bikes will still be on the road, and they will be more problematic outside of the bike lanes.\nI will also add a few things that are not being considered. I have heard in interviews that the transport minister believes that \"bike lanes should exist in places that make sense\". Bike lanes don't make a ton of sense on residential roads. A cyclist that rides only on residential roads can only access other residences. I know nobody who's daily commute is from one residence to another on the same street. Cycling makes sense when walking takes too long but the bike doesn't. Realistically, that distance is somewhere between 3 and 20 km (most people can ride 20 km in an hour). This means that a cyclist needs to ride on main streets to get to their destination. Furthermore, residential streets are rarely congested. This means that a car that wishes to overtake can easily do so with plenty of space in the oncoming lane. The motorized vehicles are also not traveling much faster than the cyclist. Bike lanes make the most sense in main streets.\nIt is also worth noting the gathering of data, and the case of a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy. We can see in some countries that bicycles are used year-round, even in harsh winters. This is because they have good cycling infrastructure. When we see that very few bikes are on the road in the winter, it's not because it's cold. It's because there's ploughed into a wall in the bike lane and rightmost sides of the road and the drivers have less control. In have in my youth spent an entire year without driving, and used my bike everywhere. A winter coat is plenty in the winter, as the act of riding the bike can keep you warm. However, poorly maintained roads are a much larger problem. Having the strength to stop and haul a bicycle over a wall of packed ice is a luxury not everyone possesses. If we increase the viability of biking in all weather scenarios, we will have riders in all weather scenarios. Conversely, removing bike lanes and making riding much harder discourages cyclists.\nAnother thing that can have a minor effect is allowing motorcyclists to filter through when traffic comes to a halt. A motorcycle that filters through allows space for another car to move forward, and the motorcycle is also safer at the front of a queue than in the middle.\nLastly i will adress the highway 413 proposal. It seems very brampton-centric. Highway 413 needa to be constructed to continue around toronto and meet back with the 401 around pickering, similar to the 407. Furthermore, buying back the 407 would be a significantly better improvement to the congestion than highway 413. Both can be good ideas, but with a limited budget, and a limited amount of land, it's best to pour our resources into 407, which does not require construction and would be immediately available.\nIn conclusion, the proposal is bad. The only good thing that might be in there is increased internet connectivity, but i did not read that section in detail.\n"

        "comment": "It is abundantly clear to me that the Ford government cares little for science, facts or the safety of its constituents. This short-sighted bill does nothing but send Ontario further back into the dark ages. These are some of the numerous reasons why Ontario's bike lanes must stay:\n1. Numerous studies around the world have PROVEN that bike lanes reduce congestion. What increases congestion is induced demand, which comes from adding more traffic lanes. Research shows that the more traffic lanes that are put in, the more it appeals to people who may not otherwise have chosen to drive, thereby putting more cars on the roads and increasing congestion. Removing bike lanes will not improve congestion. Adding more lanes for cars will increase congestion.\n2. The provincial government shouldn't be adding red tape and bureaucracy to slow down local governments trying to increase transportation options. Doug Ford needs to stay in his lane. I don't want my tax dollars being used to rip up infrastructure that not only many people use, but was expensive to install. It's extremely wasteful in so many ways.\n3. I live in Toronto and use bike lanes everyday. I consider them essential transportation infrastructure.\n4. We need to think about guaranteeing safety and providing options for vulnerable road users instead of just maximizing the number of cars on the road. Putting me directly in traffic SEVERELY reduces my safety, but Doug Ford has make it clear that the lives of cyclists don't matter as much as those of car owners.\n5. If the number one complaint people have against cyclists is that they ride in the road at low speeds and get in the way, obviously if there\u2019s a bike lane that\u2019s not going to be an issue. It\u2019s only when there\u2019s no dedicated cycling infrastructure and they\u2019re forced to occupy the same space as vehicles that it becomes one.  It\u2019s not like cyclists are getting in the way intentionally, if there\u2019s nowhere else to ride there\u2019s nowhere else to ride, so removing bike lanes only exacerbates this problem.\n6. With fewer cars on the road, emissions are reduced, helping in the fight against climate change, something we should be striving for!\n7. When I drive, I would much rather cyclists be out of my way in their own bike lanes, feeling safer for EVERYONE on the road. Bike lanes have also been shown to decrease speeds on roads, making them safer for not only cyclists, but also pedestrians.\n8. Bike lanes support transit by making it easier to get to stations.\n9. Why is removing street parking on major thoroughfares never on the table to reduce gridlock? If you remove street parking, you free up a lane. It's honestly a no brainer.\n10. There are no good alternative routes for Yonge or Bloor that go for any lengthy distance so it's simply not an option for cyclists to take alternative roads. They will be in traffic if the bike lanes are removed.\n11. I have this last, but it most important: Bike lanes save lives.\n"

This bill would affect our cycling plan in the City of Hamilton.\nI volunteer with Cycling Without Age (CWA), a program that gives shut in Seniors the right to the wind in their hair with rides on pedal assist electric trishaw. An organization like CWA brings a different perspective to the utility of and need for bike lanes. It's an equity issue: seniors and people with limited physical mobility would otherwise not be able to enjoy the benefits of cycling, being out and about, experience the social interaction and conversation, etc. Thanks to CWA, they can participate in a way that their circumstances would otherwise preclude. Dedicated, safe bike lanes facilitate their social and physical participation in an activity from which they would otherwise be foreclosed.

I no longer cycle to work but I cycle frequently from work thanks to BikeShare and regularly cycle for recreation or to run errands. This is only possible because there is the Martin Goodman trail and various bike lanes that run continuously East to West and North / South on some key arteries.\nI also walk, take transit, and drive.\nEvery time that I can ride a bike to go to / from downtown or to run errands is a time that I am not driving. One less car on the road. That's multiple times a week that I leave my car parked in the driveway and walk or ride to get food or run errands.\nI've ridden along University Avenue and Bloor / Danforth many times over the past couple of years. The bike lanes are game changers - it is much safer riding these routes. They are continuous routes with traffic lights. Cyclists are separated from drivers and there is parking for cars.\nTell me, if you get rid of those cycling lanes are you also going to get rid of the parking?\nWhat about all the food delivery riders on Bloor Danforth - are their lives worth less than ours because they are generally low income people and probably not Canadians?\nBike lanes make the roads safer for cyclists, pedestrians and drivers.\nYou are completely misguided if you think a couple of more traffic lanes will reduce the traffic congestion in Toronto. What will reduce traffic congestion is when people leave the car at home and choose other modes of transportation.\nI vote and I am a taxpayer.\nDoug Ford - you need to focus on running the province and leave the city to Olivia Chow and her team of city councilors as you clearly do not understand the needs of all citizens in this city.\n"

        "comment": "I have significant concerns about Bill 212. I completely oppose a framework that requires provincial approval to implement bike lanes and that supports the removal of existing bike infrastructure in our cities, as well as the province\u2019s bid for an exemption from the Environmental Assessment Act for enterprises, activities, proposals, plans, and programs for or related to Highway 413 (I  have submitted a separate comment on the Highway 413 Act).\nBill 212 is unprecedented jurisdictional overreach that will impact the safety of all road users. It will not reduce gridlock, save money, or improve the quality of life of Ontarians. I am not against driving; our household owns a car, and we drive between cities and within to visit family, friends, and businesses. I mostly transit or bike within the city, but my partner only drives\u2014we are both completely baffled by this proposed legislation and how out of touch it is with the daily experience of average Ontarians. Getting people who don't want to drive out of their cars and into alternative modes of transportation would reduce traffic and gridlock. The bike lanes on Bloor have made it safer and faster for us to drive by separating bikes from the car traffic lane. We don't have to worry as much about hitting someone or having someone on their bike take the full lane (as is their right) and slow down traffic. There are thousands of users per day on the bike lanes Premier Ford wants to remove in Toronto, which would mean thousands of cars back on the road.\nI want vibrant, innovative, accessible cities in Ontario full of well-connected destinations where we can build community and support our families and businesses.  If you refer to the Bloor Bike Lane reports prepared by Toronto city staff, local businesses are more successful in areas with bike lanes. The province's proposal undermines local governance and supports an outdated model that will keep our cities constantly gridlocked, bereft of community, bleeding money on upkeep for crumbling road infrastructure, and ultimately a danger for everyone on the road (but especially anyone walking or biking).\nIf the provincial government truly supports Ontarians, including drivers, then you must not pass Bill 212. Do not interfere in municipal efforts to accelerate and expand our cycling networks of connected bikeways. Please stand for us and reject using our safety as a pawn in a larger culture war. This is not a left or right issue, nor a drivers vs. cyclists issue. Every single driver I know, including myself, wants everyone to be safe and be empowered to make their own choices. A robust network of separated bike lanes is a WIN-WIN. Driver's don't have to share their immediate lane with cyclists or with other drivers who only do it out of necessity due to a dearth of other viable options (thus making them more likely to be bad drivers). Those who choose to bike are safe and save time/money using a well-connected bike network that does not constantly put them in conflict with drivers. One more bike on the road is one less car; bikes take up far less space on the road than a single-occupancy vehicle.\n\"We have to do everything we can to make sure there\u2019s never a death in the city. One death is way too many when it comes to bicycle riders. We have to make sure that they\u2019re safe.\" That was the Premier back in 2017 on TVO's Political Blind Date. \u201cYou\u2019re nervous when there\u2019s no bike lanes. At least I was,\u201d he said. All drivers agree with that quote, be true to your own sentiment! We are all more nervous while driving, cycling, walking, or taking transit when there is a lack of proper infrastructure. Across the province, we need separated bike lanes, dedicated priority transit lanes, and more secure pedestrian pathways to prevent deadly accidents within our cities. Instead of more highways that induce more car traffic, build out our local trains and a high-speed rail corridor, which would be more efficient at transporting more people (and money) into cities at more reasonable maintenance costs.\nThe province is ignoring evidence-based solutions and the significant body of research that supports bike lanes as a means to reduce traffic for drivers and improve safety, and that indicates giving drivers \"more lanes\" creates induced demand, doing nothing to solve gridlock. Municipal governments have the local knowledge and contextual understanding necessary to effectively address specific community transportation needs. Any provincial legislation that would limit municipalities from serving their communities ultimately undermines local governance and the ability of municipalities to protect the well-being of their residents. All levels of government have a clear public health obligation to ensure roadways are safe for all users.\nProtected bike lanes within a well-connected network 1) improve the flow of traffic by incentivizing those who don't want to drive to bike and reducing conflict points, 2) prioritizes the safety of all road users and lowers the potential for deadly accidents, 3) makes commutes more enjoyable for drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians, and 4) directly connects people with destinations, benefitting our businesses who want more visibility and foot traffic (not car traffic that just passes them by). Not every trip will be bikeable, and not every person will choose to ride a bike. We must use evidence-based solutions to keep people moving across the province, and not take away the democratic voices of my municipal leaders and my community. If the government is serious about reducing gridlock, the only way forward is to invest in and build a massive public transit infrastructure, and augment municipal streets with alternative means of mobility, such as bike lanes.\n"

I am a middle-aged cyclist who commutes 18km to work 2-3 times per week.  I do it because it helps me stay active, reduces my gaz costs and decreases my frustration with traffic.  And I have voted for all 3 major political parties at one point or another.\nComing from a city with a much more advanced cycling culture, the city of Toronto was a shock.  I have resided in the north of the city for almost 2 years (where the cycling infrastructure is not great, but improving) and have had one fall causing injuries and 3 near misses with vehicles before I figured out the best / safest way to take & navigate half thought out construction detours.  Most commuters that are new cyclist would have abandoned the idea of cycling.\nAgreed that the traffic in Toronto is horrible - this will not be fixed by removing 2 bike lanes and limiting expansion of the network.  In order for more regular commuters to take up cycling, Toronto and its neighbors will need to up their game by building a coherent cycling system.  This is actually progressing at a decent pace.  Playing Right wing VS Left wing politics over placement of 2 bike panes is not evidence-based planning.  Let the municipalities take care of the municipalities, establish metrics with penalties if you want to micromanage, but a veto power based on political rational will only delay progress.  I do not find the justifications provided for this ammendment convincing.  You can use bad metrics to justify anything if you\u2019ve made up your mind.

I have also been a driver on the same streets.\nHaving also travelled to European cities that are very bike friendly, I can confidently say that we have room for improvement in Ontario. In summary:\n- Insufficient planned space: Most of the roads we bike on in Ontario are fully shared with vehicles with inadequate space for safe biking alongside cars. Many roads have no shoulder or space for a cyclist and car to pass safely.\n- Poor driver education: A good proportion of drivers are unaware the cyclists have a right to share the road. I have had individuals yell at me that I shouldnt be there, coal-roll me and intentionally drive onto a gravel shoulder in front of me to kick up gravel in my face.\n- Lack of protective infrastructure: In busy urban areas protective infrastructure like barriers or separations between cyclists and cars are rare. These are needed to increase safety for cyclists, and increase the number of people who use bikes for transportation. Many are scared to ride bikes in urban areas because these are missing.\nI pay significant provincial taxes and expect our provincial government to do better when it comes to establishing a framework and systematic supports to improve our active transportation system. This bill will degrade current state as follows:\n- The scope of the legislation extends province-wide and the risks include the politicization and polarization of bike lanes\n- Bill 212 restricts where new bike lanes can be built\n- An addendum to the framework will require the province to remove sections of the Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue bike lanes in the City of Toronto and return them to a lane of traffic for motor vehicles\n- If passed, Bill 212 will provide the province with the authority to establish a review process on other existing bike lanes\nI strongly urge you to revise this Bill prior to passing it to law so that we will build a strong active transportation system in Ontario.\nSincerely,\n49yr old female now living in the Durham Region.\n"

Additionally, it is not clear to me that removal of a few lanes will lead to higher traffic overall since there are plenty of alternate streets (e.g. when a street is closed due to maintenance traffic simple goes around). Will the Ministry of Transportation consider\n- automatic approval of designs approved if the Ministry of Transportation has not made a decision on them after a duration (say 1 month) has passed once municipalities have submitted designs to the Ministry of Transportation, or\n- lowering the driving age to 14 (as it has been in the past in other provinces), or\n- removing this section from the proposal?\n"
