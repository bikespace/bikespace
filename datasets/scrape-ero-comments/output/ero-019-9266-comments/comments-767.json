Thanks to biking every day my health has never been better.\nI consider the bike lanes I've used this year an essential piece of infrastructure like roads and sidewalks.\nToronto's bike lanes made me feel much safer riding my bike in the city and I hope they continue to be built and I see more cyclists on the road.\nI would have never rode my bike so much if it weren't for the accessible and safe bike lanes on college and Bloor. I hope they continue to be improved and expanded.\nI also hope that the Gerrard bike lane can be extended further east for a better option to travel East / west , south of Bloor Street.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are a crucial feature of transit within our municipalities, and especially large cities. As a cyclist, I have experienced many close calls with motorists who have either not been paying attention while driving, or do not know the rules of the road. Just last night I experienced a driver aggressively driving too close and honking at me along a street that had been reduced to a single lane due to construction, despite following road signs. I also have my license and drive. Removing bike lanes will not only fail to alleviate congestion, it will also lead to more accidents and danger for cyclists. I strongly feel that investments in public transit and a focus away from car-centric infrastructure will ultimately be a better investment than this act claims it will provide. We need more bike lanes - not fewer!\n"

        "comment": "It is extremely regressive to attempt to damage active infrastructure in any major city, using it as distraction to force a lack of environmental oversight on a major highway project is appalling and deceptive. Beyond the environment, this is a gross overstep of the provincial government attempting to take control from municipalities and cities, which need to develop in their own context without adding additional red tape and government waste. Was it not the provincial PCs who vowed to reduce red tape? And yet here you are attempting to increase it for sake of your own manipulative goals.\nThere is abundant scientific evidence indicating that bike lanes are a BENEFIT to easing traffic. What ever happened to \u201cYou\u2019re nervous when there\u2019s no bike lanes. At least I was. We have to do everything we can to make sure there\u2019s never a death in the city. One death is way too many when it comes to bicycle riders.\" - Doug Ford 2017.\nProtected lanes protect cyclists, and if you continue to support this initiative, more cyclists will die.\nCan you look these families in the eye and say that their children deserve it? That the little protection they have should taken away, putting them more at risk?\nAppalling behaviour, I expect better from elected officials.\n"

        "comment": "We live in the Etobicoke area.  The bike lanes were installed and implemented to the best of my knowlege with minimal or NO consultation.  The first we heard is when the city sent our flyers that looked like it was consultation but in fact was just informing us what they were doing.\nSince these bike lanes have been implemented, traffic on all the side streets has increased DRAMATICALLY.  Speeding through the neighbourhoods to avoid the grid lock on Bloor has made streets that we all walk on dangerous to cross.  I watch people sprint across the roads as many of the cars cutting through are not aware of all the stop signs.  What was once a 5 minute drive to the highway has been increased to 15-20 on a good day.  The confusing and constantly changing lines on the roadways to adjust to Cafe Toronto are also contributing to the confusion and chaos.\nOnce the bike lanes were implemented nothing changed to accommodate right hand turns onto South Kingsway which leads to even more unnecessary gridlock.  Bike lanes are amazing if they are done correctly.  Toronto had the opportunity to do it right and instead did it as fast as possible.  One interesting fact is the Queens University uses the poor traffic planning in TO as a case study for the Civil Engineering traffic engineering class.  Having 2 out of our 3 boys as Civil Engineers they continually point out intersections in Toronto that were used as examples of poor Urban Traffic planning.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 will not reduce gridlock.\nThis is just another way in which Doug Ford is trying to distract people from the fact that Bill 212 is trying to build another toll highway (413) that decimates environmental protection, individual protections of their own land and puts money in the pockets of developer friends. No highway construction has ever reduced gridlock and this one will not either.\nIt is very clear that by taking out bike lanes in the city, we will be putting more cyclist's lives at risk, wasting AT LEAST 48 million taxpayer dollars for a plan that will not reduce gridlock at all. Bike lanes in the city are used by a large percentage of Torontonians and the safer they are the more Torontonians will use them. If you get rid of these lanes not only are you pushing Toronto into YEARS of construction and further gridlock due to increased street construction, you will be effectively killing many cyclists and forcing those who used bikes back into cars which will again increase gridlock. Not only that, but most roads in Toronto where there were bike lanes were only ever single-lane traffic. There will be no better traffic flow if bike lanes are taken out. In fact, the traffic flow will be worse because there will be more cyclists driving cars.\nThe Ontario government needs to stay out of the city. They also need to be honest about the fact that Bill 212 is merely an excuse to push forward a corrupt toll highway development plan that will cost taxpayers close to 10 billion dollars and that will probably end up just like the 407.\n"

        "comment": "Regarding bike lanes:\nSafe and interconnected cycling lanes are imperative in creating a diverse and equitable city. They allow for freedom of movement for a wide range of age groups and backgrounds and reduce the strain on motorways and the fight for parking in the city. Kids can safely cycle to a friend's house, people can cycle to work in the fresh air, grab groceries and do errands, deliver food and packages. Having choices in getting around ultimately reduces the strain on all forms of transportation, be it car, transit, and cycling.\nHaving only a short test period of these new bike lanes in not enough to properly assess the changes in behavior that comes with replacing a lane of traffic. When driving becomes INITIALLY inconvenient, eventually people that are able switch to a more convenient transport system (be is the TTC or cycling). Which in turn reduces car traffic and normalizes the system.\nThe key is that it's not all or nothing, not everyone is able to cycle just like not everyone has access to a car and a license. Having bike lanes along these major arteries is KEY to creating an easy to use and convenient bicycle network. (Previously I'd have to go x1.5 further to get to work and still need to cycle on dangerous roads, whereas now it is a much more direct route.)\nAnd finally, this is a municipal issue, not a provincial issue. Having the provincial government involved would just adds red tape and bureaucracy and be a waste of taxpayer dollars.\nRegarding highways:\nMultiple studies over decades (see \"supporting links\") show that adding lanes of highway only produces more traffic. If it's easier to drive then more people will, and therefore the congestion is ultimately the same. It is instead more effective to provide alternatives to car travel by providing *reliable* and *convenient* modes of public transit like trains, LRTs, etc as well as infrastructure like bicycle lanes. Of course, sometimes driving is the only option depending on where you're going and what you're carrying with you. In which case, if more people take the train or their bike, highways will be less congested with commuters going to the office and be open to the people that need them.\nIf it's easier to take the train to work, why *wouldn't* people use it?\nInstead of building more highways, I'd instead suggest reacquiring the 407, infrastructure that already exists and is severely underutilized.\nCanada is lagging behind the rest of the world when it comes to high speed trains and interconnected networks of reliable and convenient transport. Train travel to BC is SLOWER than when it was first built over a century ago. In Germany, there is a train station in every small hamlet creating transportation equity between both rural and urban regions of the country.\n"

        "comment": "I am against the bike lines\nThey have been very disruptive in our community. I live in Bloor  West Village, and work in Etobicoke.\nThese bike lanes cause dangerous, congestion. It is very difficult for elderly people to get around, and have access to the services in our neighborhood.\nThe bike lanes pose a challenge for families, with young children that are not able to use the bike lanes, but are inconvenienced by the long cues of traffic.\nAs a business owner in the area, the bike lanes have negatively impacted our business. Our clients are less likely to come, as it is difficult to get to our place of business, and difficult to park.\nThe most upsetting aspect is that the bike lanes and very rarely used.  There are less than 10 bikes using the lanes over the course of the day.  This is in stark contrast to the hundreds of people that are negatively impacted by them.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 is yet another example of this government acting on preconceived notions without adequate input from those who will be affected. I am taking part even though I do not anticipate that my comments will make any material difference on the outcome.\nI have not seen any material evidence that removing bike lanes will improve traffic flow or make streets safer for everyone who uses them. It is illogical to conclude that bikes travelling with cars in the same lane will somehow ease traffic and be safer for riders. Many riders who feel unsafe riding in mixed traffic will simply move to the sidewalk, placing pedestrians in danger.\nAs well, e-bike riders and delivery workers will likely move to the sidewalk to avoid operating within the mixed traffic stream. Because they are essentially unregulated, move more rapidly, are heavier and silent, I feel it's only a matter of time before someone is killed. They belong on the roads within a marked bike lane.\nIf the government really wished to improve traffic flow it would have also outlawed construction sites which occupy travelled lanes for months at a time. I believe that was not done because the government  is influenced by the support it gets from the development industry (see: Greenbelt scandal).\nI do not wish to see my tax dollars spent on removing bike lanes put in place by my municipally elected Council.  City Council made a decision - which it was elected to do - and has invested in the City in a way that it believes is correct. The fact that the Provincial government is prepared to spend my money to overrule that decision is offensive to me.\nIf the Provincial government has legitimate concerns about how traffic flows, it should consult the City in an open manner, and reach a consensus on how conditions could be approved. There could then be joint action to solve an issue that affects the Toronto region, rather than a high-handed, autocratic decision direct solely at the City. As I have said, I do not expect this consultation to change anything.\nThose are my comments.\n"

        "comment": "We do not support Bill 212, which is being rushed through without adequate transparency, and that it is about much more than just Toronto bike lanes. The majority of this bill is about the expropriation of farmland, green areas and private property for Highway 413 and its concurrent broadband network that will be required for tolls to be added to the 413 in the near future. We object to this highway being constructed on sensitive lands in southern Ontario that need protecting, while privately owned Highway 407 is being demonstrably under-utilized after its early sale to private interests by the provincial government soon after its completion.\nWe also object to the obfuscation by the Ford government in trying to mask the greater impacts of this bill by pushing its public agenda of Toronto streets as too crowded by bike lanes that reduce street passages. The new and previously existing bike lanes are heavily used by non-polluting cyclist commuters and recreational users, day and night. Gridlock has been shown not to be solved by adding more lanes in either city or rural streets, but reduced lanes in city streets reduces the real hazards of speeding, traffic noise and unclocked speed racers who are increasingly killing other drivers, cyclists and pedestrians of all ages in all parts of the city.\nThis obfuscation by the Ford government must be brought into the light of day for the sake of all Ontario taxpayers and travellers in the greater Toronto area, whether by personal auto, truck, public transportation, motorcycle or bicycle, as well for the protection of our diminishing, non-renewable natural environment.\nDo not pass Bill 212! Thank you for taking submissions from we, the taxpayers of Ontario.\n"
