        "comment": "There are a lot of things to consider with this bill. Firstly, let's consider economic implications. Enhancing Toronto's cycling infrastructure is sound investment into our community's future. In cities globally, we've seen that comprehensive and user-friendly bike networks can influence commercial activity positively by increasing accessibility and decreasing congestion. This considered shift towards a more sustainable mode of transport not only benefits local businesses but also contributes to reducing residents' transportation costs. Cycling is also a much more accessible mode of transportation for people in Toronto than owning a car is.\nSecondly, safety remains an imperative concern coupled with this policy change. By investing in secure bike lanes, we create safer streets for all users \u2014 not only cyclists but pedestrians and motorists too. Secure cycling paths decrease the risk of collisions and contribute to overall traffic calming. For all the complaints people have about the separated bike lanes - do you think that they're going to be happy when all the cyclists have no choice but to be in the main traffic lanes? Regardless of your take on cyclist actions - you cannot deny that they are much more vulnerable than someone inside a car.\nWhile it may seem as though adding an extra lane for vehicular traffic might alleviate congestion issues or improve flow during peak times; studies indicate otherwise - It can lead to 'induced demand,' where any reduction in traffic is temporary as new drivers swiftly consume extra capacity. We've seen this with every highway lane addition.\nThese are not small considerations that need to be addressed before implementing this policy modification considering long term vision about what kind environment we want foster in Toronto.\n"

Legislating that motor vehicle lanes are sacred and must be preserved regardless of a municipality's intent is poor policy and reeks of scapegoating. Overriding municipal decisions for no reason except to blame cyclists for provincial planning failures is an overreach without precedent. Please remove this entire section from the bill.\n"

        "comment": "Re: ERO # 019-9266\nPolicies to keep Toronto moving are not limited to bike lanes.  The following should be reviewed and/or eliminated:\n1.  CafeTO which originates as a COVID measure should be terminated now that COVID is over.  The City of Toronto and restaurant owners should not be profiting from tax payers who has already paid their taxes.\n2.  Events, strikes and protests that cause closures of highways and primary streets should be limited.  It is noteworthy that most events/strikes/protests are held during months when weather is good.  I question the dedication of protestors/demonstrators to their cause and suggest moving these events to January and February using the bike lanes when they are not being used by bikers.  Or limit them to a special dedicated freedom of speech location or locations that are either relevant to their cause (not marching all over the streets of Toronto.\nAs for safety concerns:\n1. Bikers especially those with motors should carry insurance and register their vehicles and be treated the same way as other vehicles and drivers on the road.  My husband in his 70s was hit unconscious by a biker in downtown Toronto and was brought to Mount Sinai to be stitched up.  The biker did not remain on the scene.  Some good Samaritan called the ambulance and picked up all the pieces of his watch.  If it had been a car, the driver will be arrested as he fled the scene and his gold watch would have been covered by insurance.\n2.  Clear legislations and enforcement of bicycles, especially the ones with motors, to obey the Highway Traffic Act similar to cars.  Including travelling in the legal direction, obeying traffic lights and pedestrian right of way.\n3.  Bikers should take road and/or written test just like drivers and be licensed so they can be ticketed for disobeying the Highway Traffic Act.  They should also pay annual license fees for renewal if they are using the road like motor vehicles.\n"

It is not the business of a representative of St Catharines to decide on Ottawa's parks, or the representative of Belleville to make demands of Kitchener's garbage pickup. Why should a new provincial bureaucracy be created to overrule a network of bodies that already exist at the local level? It is pointless.\nThis is but one of many arguments against the legislation, including that cars are a negative influence on our cities, bike lanes and cycling make for more welcoming environments, encouraging cycling betters the health of our citizens, and we must respond to the ongoing climate crisis. Any one of these is sufficient on its own to dismiss this legislation. As such, this legislation should not be passed.\n"

The \u201cslow down\u201d created by bike lanes is greatly embellished, if even existent, and inconsequential when you consider that it protects all of us and makes more enjoyable and livable neighbourhoods.\nAs a driver, I like knowing that I\u2019m at less risk of an killing someone because they have a safe way to get around the city, one which may be their only means, while also having health and environmental  benefits. One route I drive often had a bike lane installed then extended, there was no noticeable change in driving time. Bike lanes are not the problem, they are one part of a solution strategy.\nAnecdotally, the biggest slowdowns I\u2019ve been in have been caused by inattentive drivers who either have caused an accident or have poor habits that create domino effects in the chain of cars behind them.\n1. Bike lanes create functional safety barriers between pedestrians and traffic, while provided alternative means for people to transit the area. Done right, they can even improve the aesthetic and desirability to live in an area.\n2. Bike lanes are part of an accessible transit strategy for ALL citizens. Providing all constituents, not just those with the privilege of owning a car; a safe way to move through our cities should be sought by our governments not challenged.\nBike lanes provide life saving transit infrastructure whether you ride for employment (ie food delivery, commuting), general transportation, health, recreation, or athletic training. They also can save a driver the trauma of being responsible for the tragedy of taking a life or permanently disabling someone.\n3. More lanes does not equal better traffic. Time and time again more roads and lanes has proving a failing way to effectively reduce congestion. Don\u2019t be a failure, build cities that a livable, transit-able and safe for all constituents.\nEffective and intelligent strategies will always consider the lives and needs of all constituents, and how a city that has a diverse transit system and infrastructure becomes a more desirable place to invest and live.\n4. Stop wasting money. The most successful cities in reducing traffic are the ones with forward think plan that incorporates bikes, public transit, cycling and other modes. Taking out lanes is costly , a waste of my taxes, and motivated by politics rather than intelligence. Please, don\u2019t be that person that gets a kid killed where a bike lane could have saved them because who wanted to appeal to some uninformed voters. Lead, do the right thing, and help build better province for all of us.\n5. Municipalities should be allowed to create transit infrastructure that productively meets the needs of its local citizens without provincial interference or added cost. This supports the democratic system and structure we have in place, and allows local governments to establish plans that serve the targeted interests of their community.\nFrom a person side, this is my life and the life of others you have a responsibility towards. We elect our governments to fulfill a responsibility to better the lives of all they serve. Focusing road infrastructure on one privileged class of persons (like myself) neglects the safety and needs of others while simultaneously ensuring that our cities cannot build transit plans and community design that follows the supporting evidence that car centric plans do not work.\nPlease, let our province it is municipalities build great cities that are safe, desired, livable and easily commutable, regardless of your access to a car.\n"

Municipalities have comprehensive long-term transportation plans, informed by years of research and consultation, and they should be ultimately responsible for delivering on what would work best for their residents.\nBike lanes have allowed thousands of Ontarians to ditch their cars - saving money, improving their health, and getting a better sense of their cities. Bike lanes have been shown time and again to increase local business revenues, as cyclists tend to spend more money at small businesses vs drivers. They allow people a choice about how they navigate their cities. They have allowed elderly people and parents with kids get around without needing to drive.\nYour policy will have one effect, which is to increase congestion. Turn cyclists into drivers and the congestion will only get worse. Congratulations on a red tape inducing policy which will have the revers of the intended impact.\n"

        "comment": "I do not like the government impeding on my freedom to get around my city. I do not appreciate the Brampton based minister of transportation making traffic planning decisions for Toronto or any other municipality. Toronto city council knows best where to install bikes and how to make its own traffic planning decisions. Due to the failure of the ministry of transportation, Toronto does not have a safe and adequate infrastructure for pedestrians, transit users, and motorists, let alone for cyclists. And 2024 is proving to be deadly for Toronto pedestrians and cyclists. This is a wrong headed move by the provincial government as other solutions would be more effective at reducing gridlock such as open the Eglington LRT and the Finch LRT, subsidize 407 tolls for commercial truck fleets, allow TTC and GO bus only lanes, extend the sidewalks, change the zoning rules to allow more density for residents and small, local business ventures; reduce the number of Uber, Lyft and other ride sharing drivers, remove on street parking on most roads, move the speed limit to 30 km/h, discourage single person occupancy vehicle use and apply road congestion pricing on over-sized personal vehicles such as SUVs and monster pickup trucks or limit the number of vehicles within certain city areas.\nThe government is being short sighted with this proposal and there may be negative and untintended consequences because they want to remove the bike lanes on Bloor, University, Eglinton, and Yonge streets.  A significant number of cyclists in Toronto are car owners and instead of cycling to their destination, they will now use a car which will add to the congestion. And the cyclists that do not own a car, they are going to use these same roads where the bike lanes use to be anyways. Bloor, Yonge, University and Eglinton are primary destinations for work, shopping, entertainment for foot, transit and bicycle traffic, not just motor vehicles. Removing the bike lanes isn't going to deter bicycle use in Toronto. Getting around the city on foot, on transit, and by car are still terrible options.\nThe government is threatening the Toronto cycling community and they will organize and potentially impede rush hour traffic flow with protests. There have been numerous altercations with motorists and cyclists posted on social media this year and it could escalate in number of motorist/cyclist conflicts and degree of violence.\nThis bill will not relieve gridlock in the GTA. Toronto doesn't have a too many bicycles problem, it has a too many cars problem. There is no more space to build new roads for cars and adding more cars to a finite road system is counter-intuitive.\nAnd where are the additonal cars going to park? Toronto is building new condos without underground parking over old parking lots and CafeTO restaurants are generating more revenue for the city than paid parking spots during the program, for example.\nThe government needs to listen to the traffic experts and look what other cities in the world are doing to successfully address their congestion problems. The government needs to give the streets and roads back to the people who work, shop, and live in Toronto instead of to cars.\n"

        "comment": "With all due respect I don\u2019t see how this could POSSIBLY reduce gridlock. Bike lanes are PROVEN, EFFECTIVE traffic reduction measures. They require minimal space compared to car lanes (allowing for parking, extended sidewalks, patios for businesses, trees, and more) yet facilitate the movement of more people per square metre around cities. Encouraging more people to cycle through the addition of more bike lanes will permit people who do need to commute by car to have overall more space on the road. Having a provincial road block to their development will not help anybody and I can guarantee is seeding resentment in citizens of cities who wish for MUNICIPAL matters to be controlled by MUNICIPAL governance, not a provincial nanny-government who is so pathetic they spend their time trying to destroy healthy, eco-friendly, economically-wise measures instead of implementing anything that would actually help this province.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is proposed by the government with very strong intent to remove the bike lanes on Bloor Street, Yonge Street and University Avenue in downtown Toronto, which is an extremely short-sighted decision. The bill will do nothing to address the gridlock problem while posing a significant danger for cyclists and degrading the accessibility and liveability of many regions not just in Toronto, but also the GTA.\nThe city of Toronto is old and many of the streets were not designed to handle the volume of car traffic it currently experiences to begin with. Removing the bike lanes on major roads only increases the throughput along these major roads, which is *useless* in reducing traffic as the bottlenecks occur at intersections which for the most part cannot be changed. Additionally, without bike lanes, cyclists will feel unsafe bicycling on the roads. As it is *completely legal* for cyclists to take the entire lane, but illegal to go on the pedestrian sidewalk while cycling, cyclists will *take up the entire lane* which will *worsen existing traffic*.\nGood protective bike lanes allow safe cycling, which encourages people to bike and stay active. As the country and province experience increasing rates of obesity, diabetes and a myriad of health problems amongst the population, we should be encouraging people to stay active and use alternative methods of transportation which would *reduce the burden on our healthcare system* as people get healthier, an issue this government seems to be refusing to properly address that is definitely purely coincidental.\nThis Bill is one of the extremely disappointing examples of the government exerting unwanted and unnecessary pressure on major metropolitan areas where people who live there on a daily basis are being sacrificed to appease suburban commuters who refuse to even think about a life without driving everywhere. We should give people the freedom to explore alternative methods of travel, not force everybody into cars. Please repeal the bill and draft something that promotes alternative forms of transportation.\n"

        "comment": "I am disappointed by this initiative of the government to remove existing and limit the construction of new bike infrastructure. First off, it seems the provincial government is seeking to supplant the better positioned councils in dozens of municipalities in determining what best serves each jurisdiction's needs - one needs to stay in one's lane, if you wish. Secondly, the proposed criteria for determining which lanes stay & which go have not yet been promulgated, yet the Premier is already designating lanes in Toronto that will be removed, as if the whole consultation process is simply for show. Thirdly, the existing bike lanes are along main thoroughfares for a reason - they facilitate transit for cyclists, they improve access to shops and businesses, and rumoured alternative routes (through neighbourhoods, for example), are circuitous and dangerous (far more intersections, encounters with motorised vehicles). Bicycles are different vehicles, they need separate and specially designed facilities, as do motor cars. Fourthly, one can only rewind the clock so many times before we simply are doing nothing more than wasting funds already spent. Bike infrastructure has been gathering momentum world-wide, and in Ontario as well - my city of Ottawa is a prime example of this beginning to work quite well. I've been generally pleased with the direction our provincial government has taken over the past few years - let's not ruin it by arbitrarily, without proper research, responding to an ill-advised, knee-jerk impulse to do what sounds good instead of what is good.

Yes some people will always have to commute, but if more people don't have to, it will make their lives easier too.\nIt's already been shown that the Premier has no interest in data driven decisions and this is a petty move to dictate Toronto where he still wants to be mayor. To say that you are going to rip out the Bloor, Yonge and University bike lanes before the regulations are even developed shows this is a misguided attempt to cover actions he wants to take.\nKeep the bike lanes, the data shows they work. There are so many studies out there displaying this.\nPersonally speaking, if I can avoid driving my car, I absolutely will, I infinitely prefer walking/cycling and transit even if it takes slightly longer. Guess what, that's one car off the road! And I know more people feel the same, oh look that's more cars off the road! If you make that infrastructure more appealing, fewer people will drive, easing congestion.\nMore traffic lanes do not help congestion, the concept of induced demand just invites more cars onto the road filling that space, slowing it down again.\n"

Driving in this city may be \"annoying,\" but cycling in this city often doesn't even feel safe, and it seems incredibly obvious that safety should be valued above convenience. As well, all evidence suggests that adding more traffic lanes does not necessarily result in a decrease in congestion. If we really want to fight gridlock, we should be investing in public transit so that people have options besides driving. From a sustainability perspective, the future of our planet does literally depend on deprioritizing single occupant motor vehicle use.\nHearing that Doug Ford is offering to bankroll the REMOVAL of bike lanes when we are literally in the midst of a housing crisis is simply infuriating. Furthermore, it has been proved over and over that every ridiculous claim he has made about the issues bike lanes cause is completely false: https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/doug-ford-toronto-bike-lanes-1.7\u2026\nBike lanes do not affect emergency vehicle travel times. They have not made it more difficult to access hospitals. They do, however, make it possible for me to travel safely, sustainably, and actively throughout our city.\nIt's already hard enough for our city to implement new cycling infrastructure, especially in areas outside of the downtown core where road safety is an even more present issue. As far as I know, 6 cyclists have been killed on our streets this year alone - it is disheartening and incredibly frustrating to see the people who are supposed to have our best interests at heart ignoring this in the name of convenience for car owners.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to the recent proposal to remove bike lanes in our community. This decision could have serious repercussions for public safety, traffic congestion, and overall quality of life in our city.\nFirstly, removing bike lanes compromises the safety of cyclists. Without designated lanes, cyclists are forced to share the road with motor vehicles, increasing the risk of accidents. Studies have shown that cities with dedicated bike lanes experience significantly fewer cycling-related injuries and fatalities. Prioritizing safe cycling infrastructure is essential for encouraging more residents to use bikes, which can reduce the number of cars on the road.\nSecondly, eliminating bike lanes will exacerbate traffic congestion. With more people opting for cars out of fear for their safety while cycling, we can expect an increase in vehicle traffic. This not only leads to longer commute times for everyone but also contributes to higher levels of air pollution, impacting the health of our community.\nMoreover, bike lanes promote a healthier lifestyle. Encouraging cycling as a mode of transportation reduces reliance on cars, leading to lower greenhouse gas emissions. In an era where climate change is a pressing concern, we should be investing in infrastructure that supports sustainable practices rather than retreating from them.\nI urge you to reconsider this proposal and instead focus on improving and expanding our bike lane network. Investing in safe and accessible cycling infrastructure will benefit our community by promoting safety, reducing traffic congestion, and supporting environmental sustainability.\nThank you for your attention to this important matter. I hope to see our community continue to thrive as a safe, inclusive, and environmentally friendly place to live\n"

A blanket opposition to bike lanes will not ultimately help congestion.  And removing existing cycling infrastructure that already cost $$ to be put in is the height of wasteful spending and unacceptable to taxpayers.\n"
