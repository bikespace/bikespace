        "comment": "Bill 212 infringes on the rights of Ontarians. Giving the province the right to seize land and property from Ontarians, in order to build highways as they see fit should not be allowed.\nFurthermore, the Province has not provided any evidence that Highway 413 will be effective, and thus it should not be a Priority Highway project.\nLastly, reducing bike lanes in city centers, like Toronto, will not create more space for cars, leading to less congestion. If there is no bike lane then cyclists must use the same lane as cars, and cars must leave 1 metre of space when passing cyclists. Removing bicycle lanes will simply limit the opportunity for cars to safely and legally pass cyclists, leading to more congestion.\nThank you.\n"

        "comment": "As a citizen living in Brampton, Ontario, who frequently travels to Toronto, I am writing to express my strong opposition to Bill 212 and urge the Government of Ontario to reject it in its entirety. This bill would be a significant step backward for sustainable urban planning and transportation in our province.\nA cost-effectiveness study conducted by Gu et al. [1] in New York City made the following conclusion: \u201c\u2026investments in bicycle lanes come with exceptionally good value because they simultaneously address multiple public health issues. Investments in bike lanes are more cost-effective than most preventive approaches used today.\u201d This research clearly demonstrates that bike lanes offer a highly cost-effective solution to a range of public health and environmental challenges.\nAdditionally, an economic analysis by Smith et al. [2] found that bike lanes were beneficial to businesses along Toronto's Bloor Street. The study concluded: \u201c\u2026indicators show increased economic activity on Bloor Street. Most merchants reported a higher number of customers than before the bike lane's installation, visitors indicated greater spending and more frequent visits, and vacancy rates remained stable.\u201d This finding underscores the positive impact that bike lanes can have not only on public health but also on local economies.\nMoreover, a recent CBC article [3] cites numerous studies supporting the conclusion that bike lanes benefit society in several ways, including reducing traffic congestion, improving public health, enhancing safety, and boosting the local economy.\nOn a personal note, I can attest to the positive impact bike lanes have had on my own commuting experience. My trips are faster and smoother when cyclists use designated bike lanes instead of sharing the road with cars, which can slow down traffic and create congestion.\nUnfortunately, Bill 212 appears to be an attempt to expedite the construction of Highway 413 under the pretext of improving daily commutes. Specifically, Section 2 of the Act grants exemptions from the Environmental Assessment Act for projects related to Highway 413, including its early works. This exemption raises concerns about the government\u2019s disregard for environmental and public health considerations in favour of advancing a project that many experts argue will be detrimental to Ontario\u2019s long-term interests.\nThe research overwhelmingly supports the idea that bike lanes are a positive investment in our future, both economically and socially. It is clear that this bill prioritizes the interests of developers and political supporters over evidence-based policy solutions that benefit the people of Ontario. I urge all Members of Provincial Parliament (MPPs) to reconsider the implications of this bill, put the people of Ontario first, and vote against its passage.\nReferences\n1.

        "comment": "As an Ontario resident I am disappointed to see this bill proposed. In particular, the provision to\n expedite the expropriations process to establish easements for broadband infrastructure.  I am also appalled at the plans to remove bike lanes and add more lanes and highways. I studied urban transportation planning at McGill. It is well known and demonstrated by decades of research that  over time, the extra lanes attract more drivers, which don't solve the problem in the long run.\nDo better!\n"

        "comment": "Please do not remove the bike lanes. Removing the listed bike lanes seems to be a short-sighted, backwards-looking fix to a problem. Similar to adding a lane to an expressway, these fixes are temporary and highly-damaging in the long term. They don't address the root problem or provide any sort of long-term fix. Unless we prioritize alternative means of transportation (bikes, subway, buses etc) then Bloor, University will be nightmare-ish whether it's 2 lanes of car traffic or 4.\nUse our funds to actually fix our issues, not get a cheap, short-sighted win. Do the hard work of being an adequate public servant (the job you were elected to do), please\n"

        "comment": "Time and time again, it has been proved that the removal of bike lanes DOES NOT equal the reduction of traffic congestion overall.\nMore and more people now live in the downtown core as a result of all the new condos, thus many have considered urban living in a city with nearly 3 million people. To add with a new trend, many more urban dwellers now consider e-bikes, e-scooters, or regular bikes in general to commute around downtown. It is with no doubt that this is the fastest mod of commuting throughout downtown, even faster than driving.\nAs a cyclist, whom commutes everyday throughout downtown, this is without a doubt the best way to get around downtown Toronto. I've noticed days where the number of cyclists outweigh the number of motorists on roads with bike lanes - the removal of such lanes will result in further congestion with cyclists attempting to share the road with motorists. Motorists may gain a sense of owning the road, thus not allowing extra space for cyclists resulting in more accidents (everybody knows this government already has a problem with emergency wait times at hospitals - the removal will make this far worse indeed.)\nPlease consider my comment as someone who bikes/scooters everyday and is willing to consider paying taxes for bike lanes - should these lanes be removed, you have lost my vote for the PC party for the upcoming Provincial Election.\n"

        "comment": "I vehemently disagree with this bill in essentially every aspect.\nThe province should not be dictating where cities place their bike lanes. The studies are done at the municipal level and that's where the decision should lie. The rest of the province does not need to be involved in these local issues. This bill makes it clear the conservative party is the biggest proponent of increasing red tape and expanding the roadblocks and overhead created by the government. The fact that it is being proposed that the existing lanes should be removed is a gross waste of taxpayer money, especially at time where our healthcare and education systems are failing to deliver and not being allocated sufficient funds. This isn't even getting to the point that studies show that cycling infrastructure actually reduces congestion. If you want congestion to be reduced, people need alternatives to cars, plain and simple.\nSecond, I completely disagree with the dismissal of environmental assessments. We know major construction projects like this can have devastating effects on the environment, and that fact that this government wants to ignore that entirely speaks volumes to the disdain they have for the public that has to live with the outcome. Environmental assessments are done for a reason and should continue to be done.\nFinally, if this provincial government actually cared about making travel within the province and its cities easier, they would drastically increase transit funding. We have cities like Ottawa halving their train frequencies to save less than a million a year, meanwhile this provincial government is spending 3 billion to send out 200 cheques to everyone, 250 million to cancel the beer store contract a year early, 15 million a year on advertisements telling us how great things are in the province while our services are collapsing.\nHow can you advocate for all workers to return to the office and then turn around and complain about congestion. You were the one proposing creating traffic.\nThis is financial mismanagement and government overreach on a biblical scale and this bill is just the cherry on top.\n"
