        "comment": "The bike lanes on University Ave have been delaying Ambulances and cars since they were put in with the parking. I live downtown and I have been run into and have dodged many bike riders who are the sidewalk where there are bike lanes. So why have bike lanes where bikers feel they have the right to do what ever they want.\nAlso, the electric bikes / scooters, etc. are also becoming very dangerous to pedestrians as you do not hear them and they are going at speeds well beyond the the people walking.\nI think we need to address traffic in a sensible way, the move to bike lanes was done way to aggressively and did not account for our weather and the congestion we already have. Keep the bike lanes on the side streets and create / enforce laws on bike riders like you do cars.\nAs a final note, cars need to make turns, the way the light system is set up there are huge traffic jams for cars trying to turn. We need to go to identify where turning at rush hour is a problem (Wellington and University is one) and put in lights so cars can make turns (share the road). Remember the roads were built and paid for by the car owners.\n"

        "comment": "It's extremely depressing that in the face of increased pressures from climate change that the government of Ontario has decided to make it more difficult to find viable alternatives to car traffic. As a resident of Toronto that regularly travels on foot and in the existing bike lanes it is important to stress that the danger posed by reckless drivers (usually non-residents) is absolutely preventing people that would be using cycling infrastructure more often from participating out of valid fear for their safety. We need MORE protected and cordoned off cycling infrastructure, not less, and a move to that structure would benefit the city in a number of ways, from businesses receiving more foot traffic to offset their awfully inflated rent, to parking lots being able to be redeveloped into housing and retail spaces. Please, PLEASE, focus on making the city more accessible to commuters and tourists via other means than private cars. It will benefit everyone in the longer term.\n"

So what we spend millions putting the bike lanes in, then millions ripping them out only to fit a couple more cars on the road. All that means is that more people are going to use University ave with their cars. Doing such a small expansion isn't going to fix the issue it's just going to redirect more traffic to the street creating the same amount of gridlock.

They promote health and save time. Everyday I see tens or even hundreds of bikers on the roads, commuting to work, school.

        "comment": "I challenge the government to provide detailed evidence that the removal of bike lanes will improve traffic flow. Empirical evidence collated from multiple studies suggests that this proposal will in fact result in the opposite effect: an increase in congestion as cyclists enter car lanes, reduction in safety for cyclists and motorists alike, and a decrease in the likelihood of people choosing to cycle for their daily commutes, therefore adding to vehicle traffic.\nToronto\u2019s traffic problem is not unique, and neither are the solutions. I\u2019ve included a summary of some studies from other cities. Please note that this list is far from exhaustive, I\u2019ve chosen just three in the interests of keeping word count to a minimum:\n\u201cBike Lanes, On-Street Parking, and Business: A Study of the 9th Avenue Protected Bike Lane in New York City\" (2014) - NYC Department of Transportation\nKey findings: By providing dedicated space for cyclists, the bike lane helped reduce bottlenecks caused by cyclists mixing with motor vehicles. The protected bike lane increased bike ridership without causing an increase in congestion, as it improved traffic flow.\n\"Cycling and Urban Form: The Role of Cycle Lanes in Influencing Transportation Choices in London\" (2018) \u2013 Urban Studies Journal\nKey findings: The research pointed out that bike lanes allow for more efficient use of road space, and cities that promote cycling are less likely to face the same levels of congestion as cities that rely predominantly on cars.\n\"Economic Impacts of Bicycle Lanes: A Case Study from Portland, Oregon\" (2010) - Transportation Research Board\nKey findings: This study noted that bike lanes help reduce congestion by offering an alternative to driving. By providing cyclists with safe and efficient routes, fewer people rely on cars for short trips, which are often the most congested. The study also highlighted that Portland\u2019s investments in bike lanes have contributed to more sustainable urban mobility and reduced traffic pressure.\nTo conclude, I will also offer some anecdotal evidence. I currently commute via bike to Bloor GO daily, either along Bloor Street West or Dundas West. When on Dundas West my ten-minute trip involves me entering the car lane several times to pass parked cars, each time slowing the traffic behind me and putting my safety at risk. Multiply that to include all the other cyclists on the road and it quickly become apparent that removing bike lanes will add to the problem the government is claiming it wishes to solve with this proposal.\nLike any modern global city, our solutions to the traffic problem must include a long-term plan focussing on developing viable alternatives to travelling by private vehicle. I urge the government to think of the families of those cyclists killed on the roads this year and eagerly await their evidence-based response to my comment.\n"

        "comment": "I believe the removal of bike lanes on Bloor, Yonge and University Streets, noticeably Toronto's busiest streets, is not only a slap in the face to anyone who cares about the environment and thus chooses to commute in an eco-friendly manner but also a slap in the face to the welfare of Toronto's citizens who choose to bike in general. The Ford Government is now suggesting that the safety of these citizens is less important than having less traffic in the city, which is not caused by bike lanes for the record. This proposal is disgraceful.\n"

        "comment": "I am deeply saddened and confused by this proposal for many reasons.\nI choose not to have a car. Instead, I bike my two kids around this city- to school, to the park, to their friend's houses. I need bike lanes to get us to where we need to go safely. If you want people using bikes for longer trips, which will reduce congestion, you need to have lanes on direct routes.\nIt goes against what we know to be true- there are numerous proven benefits to having bike lanes along major streets.  In 2016, the Toronto Centre for Active Transportation (TCAT) was commissioned by the City of Toronto, the Metcalf Foundation, the Bloor Annex BIA and the Korea Town BIA to investigate the economic impacts \u2013 positive, negative or neutral \u2013 of the bike lane, as well as its effect on the travel patterns and attitudes of visitors and merchants. The study found numerous economic benefits in terms of customer counts, customer frequency and vacation rates, difficulties finding parking remained small and no parking spots were removed, etc. While these may not be in the specific areas under question, the results are likely to apply in other neighbourhoods as well. Please read the entire study here: https://www.tcat.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Bloor-Economic-Impact-St\u2026\nWe also know from global studies that bike lanes reduce congestion. Why aren't we making evidence-informed decisions?!?!? Look here https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5c0e5848e5274a0bf3cbe124\u2026\nIt's short-sighted. The connection between gas-powered cars, carbon emissions and climate change are known. We need to be reducing our emissions by investing in alternative modes of transportation. Rather than spending money putting in bike lanes and spending money removing them, invest in public transportation. Why is this so hard?\nMoving bike lanes to side streets will drastically increase travel time for cyclists making it a less desirable mode of transportation. Why would we put up barriers to cycling when we need more people cycling to reduce congestion?\nPlease make evidence-informed decisions that make good economic and environmental sense, keep my kids safe and are solely to win you the next election.\n"

        "comment": "As a person who commutes into downtown Toronto from Mississauga, I don't believe removing bike lanes and building more highways will help congestion. The city is too populated for car routes to ever be the main source of transportation. Even if you were able to meaningfully expand main traffic routes to be able to handle more cars, it would just lead to more people using those routes instead of non car alternatives, thus increasing traffic congestion up to the same point we had before.\nAdditionally, I fundamentally disagree with this bill including so many different policy changes. Bike lanes are a completely different issue than waiving environmental regulations on the other construction projects currently underway. Even if I saw string data and research that supports the benefits of removing bike lanes, I'd still disagree with waiving environmental regulations for the new highways.\nIn general, please be more data driven in your approach and communication around policy changes. It's very hard to properly assess these policies when there is no data to back up the changes. If that data exists, please make it more accessible to the public. I'd be happy to be proven wrong with my current beliefs on the solutions for gridlock, but we need measured and thoughtful debates driven by data and the opinions of industry experts.\n"

Not only does it actively endanger cyclists (because people will bike whether or not the lanes are there), but it actively goes against transportation theory.\nAdding more car lanes has been empirically proven to NOT reduce traffic (see induced demand and triple convergence). Bike lanes have been proven to help with traffic congestion while benefitting users tremendously through other factors like not having to own a car to move around (which is very expensive), allowing children to ride their bikes in safety and allowing people to live healthier lives.\nThis bill is a horrible idea that clearly represents the wants of car companies, big oil and a class of suburbanites that do not understand transportation theory and do not have the experience of living in downtown Toronto.\n"

        "comment": "The bike lanes that already exist across the province where a painted lane is provided in a gutter lane without physical barriers are dangerous. This legislation would not only be harmful as it stands, but it also severely overreaches and encroaches on the jurisdiction of municipalities to determine their road network in a local context.\nA robust, anti-fragile transportation network relies on a multi-modal approach to transportation options. Not all trips are equal; investing in Ontario's multi-modal transportation network with efficient options will actually reduce gridlock and save everyone time. MTO should be focused first and foremost on regional connections, for example, the many in-progress public transit projects that are just steps away from being operable to the public and actually helping people get around the province.\nA policy to 'reduce gridlock, saving you time' should involve the core principles of Transportation Demand Management (Reduce; trips that can be avoided, Retime; encouraging trips that to be made outside of peak hours, Remode; taking different transportation modes that are more efficient during peak hours).\nOntario can do many tangible things to manage transportation demand; it could be:\n- encouraging employers' work-from-home models\n- putting in place measures to cool the commercial office space market,\n- easing zoning restrictions to promote walkability and mixed-use development\n- Encourage municipalities to remove parking minimums in residential and commercial developments and incentivize employees and residents with alternative options like transit passes, car share, bike parking, bike share, ride share, etc.\n- require municipalities to produce a strategic Transportation Demand Management plan and provide a small amount of funding for public engagement and education to implement these plans\n- across the province, provide a framework for Ontario's larger municipalities to implement congestion pricing, which can effectively incentivize alternative modes or times for travel in/out of the city core from neighbouring suburbs.\nTrialled and tested in countless cities, measures like narrowing streets, daylighting intersections, and restricting turns are changes that produce more successful results in keeping traffic moving rather than maintaining or adding an additional traffic lane to streets. Not only this, but as soon as a second lane is added, there is considerable weaving back and forth between lanes, which creates more speed variation, sudden stopping and subsequently, more gridlock. In many cases, the second lane does provide the ability to pass slower traffic to the left in the left passing lane. Streets with third and fourth lanes only carry the problems without any of the advantages. Where bike lanes remove a traffic lane, in most cases, it provides extra options for people using public spaces to travel using other transportation modes. As someone who understands just the basics of traffic and transportation, I know that wide roadways for cars do not 'reduce gridlock' or save time for most people.\nBill 212 is dangerous, destructive, and very irresponsible. Please listen to what municipal and provincial/state governments worldwide have been doing the past few decades and finding very successful. This bike lane conundrum is clearly a distraction to the ongoing and highly contested Highway 413 project that has proven ties to the Premier's office and his personal connections. We see you. It is everyone's responsibility to do everything they can to stop these projects that are being passed along with the disapproval of most Ontarians while Ontarians foot the entire bill.\n"
