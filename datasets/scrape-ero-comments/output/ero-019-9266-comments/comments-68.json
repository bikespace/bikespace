        "comment": "Bike lanes in the city play a crucial role in saving lives by providing cyclists with dedicated spaces, reducing the likelihood of accidents. They create a buffer between bikes and fast-moving vehicles, minimizing collisions and increasing safety for everyone on the road. By encouraging more people to cycle, bike lanes also contribute to reduced traffic congestion and lower emissions, creating a healthier and safer urban environment for all road users.\n"

        "comment": "The solution is to not remove bike lanes. We have residents of ON driving into the city for work because it\u2019s hard for them to get around the large city of Toronto. If transit was a better and safer option people would take it. This has nothing to with bike lanes. More people will die on our streets without protected bike lanes.\nBikes reduce carbon emissions, save the environment and help reduce gridlock. Leave the bike lanes alone. Doug has never taken a day of public transit and it shows. We spend all this money to put in biking infrastructure only have it torn up.\nHospitals are underfunded, schools are poor quality and the audacity to purposely remove bike lanes!? What\u2019s the point of it all?\nThe roads are clogged because too many people find that getting around the city is difficult.\nFrom St Clair West&Dufferin to St Clair stations takes one hour because we\u2019re not running transit properly.\nUniversity Ave and Bloor Streets both need bike lanes because it reduces congestion. Bikes aren\u2019t the problem here. We need to do something about parked cars on the streets. We are too relaxed about stopping for 15 minutes / 30 minutes and not ticketing. In LA people drive everywhere because transit isn\u2019t reliable. This is not great for the environment\n"

        "comment": "This is such a waste of money and another slap in the face to all Torontonians who use their bike to get around the city and by doing so actually help reduce the traffic jam. Removing the bike lanes is only going to make the matter worse as well as engender the lives of the cyclists who have to take those routes anyway. You are going to waste tax money to undo something that was just installed, so much for being fiscally conservative, what a joke. This is just Dough Ford meddling in local issues instead of focusing on the more urgent problems that Ontario has to deal with.\n"

        "comment": "This proposed Bill is problematic for a number of reasons:\n- adding bikelanes reduces gridlock by allowing more people to bike safely, rather than drive\n- increasing space for cars leads to induced demand, which will lead to continued gridlock. There appears to be quite a bit of research that concludes that expanding car lanes does not address gridlock. As such, the implied assumptions about bikelane policies in this bill are inconsistent with peer reviewed research. See linked studies regarding induced demand and impacts on traffic.\n- induced demand also works the other way - the more bikelanes that are constructed, the more people will use them, especially if networks are connected. See link included for peer reviewed research\n- infrastructure already prioritizes cars, expanded bike lane networks will improve mobility in urban and suburban areas, especially if those bikelanes are maintained in the winter\n- bike lanes are municipal jurisdiction\n- this bill adds red tape and creates unnecessary and duplicative bureaucracy to approve new bike lane infrastructure.\n- many people cannot afford cars or secondary cars in their household and bikelane infrastructure helps with more affordable transit options.\n- increasing active mobility can be beneficial to promote healthy livelihoods and save costs. See linked peer review study on bikelane impacts on obesity, and another study that concludes that bike lanes address multiple public health problems. In particular, investments in bike lanes are more cost-effective than the majority of preventive approaches used today..\nPersonal Anectdote: My family owns one vehicle. My wife uses this vehicle to get to work and drive our daughter to daycare. I bike to work throughout the year, including winter months. Separated bikelanes make this possible, faster, safer, and more enjoyable. If bikelanes were removed, my commute would be significantly longer, more dangerous, and would force me to consider other transportation alternatives. Public transportation is underfunded, unreliable, and takes 3x longer to get to work than biking, even in the winter. The alternative would be buying a vehicle and contributing to existing gridlock during my commute. I also prioritize biking for other reasons, including reducing my carbon footprint, and staying active.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly disagree with both the proposed removal of bike lane infrastructure and building a new highway. Ontario needs more support and budget for alternative forms of transport such as bikes, trains, and buses. I voted for the Conservatives in the last provincial election. I will not do so again if the Ford government continues to place donors above everyday people.\n"

        "comment": "Forcing Toronto to mix bikes with cars will not benefit Ontario -- on the contrary, it will harm Ontario by making Yonge, Bloor and University slower and more hazardous.\nOur bike lanes improve the flow of traffic and contribute to local business. Ripping them out will only undo those benefits, and at great public expense to people in places like Timmins, Sudbury, and Sault St Marie. But maybe the expense to these people is the point.\nThis bill, like others in Ford's history, is an excellent way to siphon off public funds to Ford's friends and donors in the construction industry. This would be in keeping in Ford's attempts to pave the greenbelt, or his plan to dig a hole under the 401, or his effort to level Ontario Place for a luxury spa. It doesn't require much to see a pattern of venality behind the costly and counterproductive projects coming from this man.\nIn short, this proposal clearly does not exist in the public interest. It is an attempt to pick the pocket of Ontarians to finance useless aesthetic quibbles. The people of Toronto should -- and certainly will -- treat it as such.\n"

        "comment": "Most of the countries around the world are focused to eliminate car usage from their cities due to their environmental impact. Each bike that's on the road is one less car, meaning less pollution. By eliminating bike lanes, or avoiding the creation of new ones, the province is creating a restriction to how many people will use the bicycle as a cheap, fast and ecologic method of transportation.\nAlso, has been pointed out by many studies that the removal of bike lanes will have close to no effect to improve the traffic and travelling times by car.\nThe focus to reduce the gridlock should be in creating alternative modes of transportation like TTC or bikes in order to remove as many cars as possible from the road.\nThat way, the ones that really need to use the car as well as the emergency services won't be stuck in traffic.\n"

        "comment": "Hi there,\nI was born in Toronto, and I've been biking here since I was a child. Over that time, I've learned that if there is not space for me, the only way to be safe is to be the size of a car.\nBike lanes take me out of traffic, removing them will put me in traffic. I'll still be on Bloor or Yonge or University, or any other artery because they are the fastest way to get down town. Instead of being away from cars (if they can go faster), I'll be in front of them, slowing them down.\nThis decision should be based on data, and the local, national, and international data are overwhelmingly in favour of bikelines. You cannot add a million cars to the road and expect traffic to remain unchanged. Traffic is a car problem, not a bike/pedestrian/transit problem.\nYou're pointed in the wrong direction.\n"

        "comment": "There is no scientific or expert evidence that removing bike lanes or requiring their implementation to not remove a car lane will improve congestion. In urban infrastructure there is a proven concept called \"induced demand\" which basically means that people will use whatever infrastructure is built for them. If you build car lanes, they will use cars on car lanes. If you build bicycle lanes, they will use bicycle on bicycle lanes. It often takes a few years for people to adjust to new infrastructure (I've heard 3 years thrown about), so there will be a bit of lag between when a bike lane is completed and when its effect is felt. Ultimately bicycles are a lot more efficient and PROVEN to reduce congestion, so much of this bill's premise is nonsense.\n"

        "comment": "Every day I cycle to work down the Yonge and Bloor Street bike lanes.\nFor my first eleven years in Toronto, I avoided biking because I was too afraid of how dangerously drivers behave on the roads here.\nTrying out some group bike rides reminded me of my love of cycling, and pushed me from avoiding it to doing over 3000 km in a year on the Bike Share and then more than 2000 km after I got my own bike.\nCars pose a profound threat to cyclists. When two things collide, the amount each accelerates depends on its mass. If your car weighs ten times as much as a bike or cyclist, they get ten times as much acceleration with you. Same if the car weighs 20 times as much. Cyclists need protection from the danger of cars and trucks, especially since many drivers are distracted by communication and entertainment systems.\nOne factor that has kept me stuck on cycling is that it has become the fastest way around the city. I get places twice as fast on a bike as on transit, and see all the cars backed up in gridlock as I go by. Having decent cycle infrastructure helps keep the roads open for people who choose to drive.\nSave the bike lanes!\n"

These have been, and continue to be sufficient to allow municipalities to manage their own public spaces and infrastructure. I am a conservative who believes government should stay in its legally mandated place. Aside from the questionable data that the Doug Ford \"Conservatives\" are basing this decision on, it's against the very principles of true conservatism for one level of government to interfere with the jurisdiction of another.\n"
