        "comment": "I think it\u2019s shameful that a city on the scale of Toronto is even considering removing bike lanes AGAIN.  Toronto is a blend of people and loads of transportation to get around through the city.  We have to provide way as of course, all of those of transportation.  Removing bike lines will not speed up traffic in our city, congestion in a major urban centre comes with a territory. Removing back planes will only support further anti-biking lifestyles and crate, unsafe conditions for those that choose to use this method of transportation.. I resent a government that will spend $45 million the work that has already been built.  I\u2019m ashamed of this city, it\u2019s not too late to make a change. Make a right change, even though it may not see everyone today, but for a better time tomorrow.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to oppose removing bike lanes. Bike lanes throughout the city of Toronto saves lives. People should have the right to choose our mode of transportation and be able to feel safe. We need more bike lanes that separate or protect cyclists from vehicles, like sidewalks do for pedestrians. We need more bike lanes that connect - that are continuous so we can be safe going places as an essential part of our daily commute. Cycling helps reduce vehicle congestion. I live near Yonge Street in Toronto and am intimidated by drivers who drive over the speed limit and/or drive so close to me that my safety is at risk. I drive but don't think I should be the king of the road as it seems some do. I do make room for the cyclists on the road, which means slowing down and passing the cyclists to ensure their safety. My drive would be so much smoother if the cyclists have their own lane. Bike lanes allows us to contribute to reducing congestion, staying fit, and get us to where we need to go safely as an alternative mode of transportation. I don't see cycling as a leisure activity alone. The roads must be shared for vehicles, cyclists, and pedestrians throughout the city, and you as a leader are hired to take care of us - you are responsible for the development of the infrastructure to keep us safe. Removing bike lanes is not the solution to reducing gridlock. Adding more bike lanes is a solution.\n"

We have already made this decision In favour of the bike lanes already in place.\nThe car drivers in Toronto who object to these lanes have to adapt to the changing times. In a world that is threatened by global warming due to the increase in greenhouse gases, citizens need alternate forms of transportation, and bike lanes offer this.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is completely misinformed about the nature and causes of traffic congestion, and will cost taxpayers money, time, space, and safety.\nUrban planners generally agree that transit users choose modes based on what is made available to them--if we build roads, people will drive; if we build trams, people take the tram; if we build safe and connected bike lanes, people will bike. We have over-built for cars in such a way as to induce demand for driving, leading to some of the worst traffic congestion on the continent (see link below on induced demand). This cannot be blamed on bike lanes.\nBike lanes are not only necessary to prevent cyclist deaths and to provide affordable, sustainable transit alternatives, they also are a boon to local economies. The fact is that drivers are not likely to stop at a local business, whereas pedestrians and cyclists are. This fact has been established by decades of research (see articles linked below). Personally, I can attest that as a Toronto citizen the largest barrier to me going out and patronizing businesses in this city is the danger, noise, and inconvenience of battling vehicle traffic.\nI am not a cyclist, but I might choose to be if the bike network in Toronto was better. Cities like Amsterdam have successfully reduced traffic and vehicular accidents by promoting safer road design and more options for cyclists and pedestrians.\n"

        "comment": "Whenever the provincial government proposes legislation, the premise that it will improve the lives of ciizens should be based on facts.\n,Bike lanes allow for more bike use and save injuries and lives. The municipalities who have built them have done the research. It has been proved already in practice, both locally in Toronto, and globally, that they improve traffic flow. Look at the Emergency Services wait times for ambulances studies for specific evidence. As a person who had to wait an agonizinly long time for an ambulance for my husband in downtown Toronto recently (because the province has underfunded that service so there are not enough personnel to carry out dispatch and attendance in a timely manner on many days,) I appreciate any other thing that will help.\nOther facts concerning pollution and global warming are also being ignored by this provincial government.  It should be focusing on getting us moving across the province by funding new electric rail and intercity bus routes. Hwy 413 will not benefit even local users beyond a couple of minutes and will certainly impact air quality.\nDoug Ford, be Leader, and help to get us out of the 'gas trap' that is harming our lives and our grandchildren's futures. Let the municipalities decide their own priorities and  you look to the bigger framework for improving everyday lives.\nNo part of Bill 212 'Reducing Gridlock' should be passed.\n"

I worry less about hitting a biker when I'm driving on a street with a bike lane, and less about getting hit by a car as a bike person and a pedestrian. Yes, if you widen the streets for car traffic, it will reduce traffic jams for a short while. But then, as history has shown, traffic ramps up again and everything is as clogged as before. Plus let's encourage more people to bike - for the environment and for their health.\n"

As a kid in growing up in the city, I almost got injured riding my bike with my dad because of the lack of bike lanes. For the first time I feel as if bike riding has become safer, now is not the time to be moving backwards.\nInstead of removing bike lanes, why don\u2019t you invest that money into getting the gardiner repaired faster? That would reduce city traffic drastically. Why don\u2019t you invest that money into the TTC so fewer cars are on the road? There are solutions that don\u2019t include putting civilians in danger.\n"

        "comment": "I am opposed to removing bike lanes from Toronto because:\n1) I don't think the province has a right to decide how municipalities manage their own traffic within the city. If this were a provincial highway, then it would be fine. I paid my taxes to the city of Toronto and I support bike lanes. Why should people from outside decide how our city streets are used? I'd like to see more evidence on what is causing the gridlock rather than automatically taking out bike lanes, which took years to establish.\n2) As a former cyclist who used to bike to work downtown before the pandemic, it was dangerous enough. I biked because it was good exercise and it was just as fast as driving (and it was definitely faster than the TTC). With the overall increase in car traffic, it becomes more dangerous. I don't think drivers should be accommodated because there are more of them. They need to make different choices if they don't like gridlock. I also believe cyclists will start to use their right to bike in the centre of the road for safety, so taking out bike lanes won't necessarily help.\n3) The province should continue to support and grow regional public transit instead, so that drivers from the suburbs take the GO Train etc as much as possible. Living in the city, most of the people I know either take public transit or bike if they want to go downtown. Drivers have to face the consequences of their choice!\n4) The CITY needs to aggressively enforce illegal stops especially during rush hour. Often when I do drive, I see gridlock is caused by one car or delivery vehicle blocking traffic or stopping illegally in no stopping zones. The city could also ban street parking at ALL times on the busiest routes.\n"

This is very much a municipal issue and adding extra red tape won't actually improve anything, it'll just be a lot of sound and fury and news articles and at the end of it, all that will be accomplished is more construction on already busy roads that will be more hostile to cyclists after it's all eventually done. Why is the province paying for minor road construction in a city? Is there too much money lying around after funding healthcare and education?\nAlso, is the Ontario government planning to become an expert in the traffic patterns of every city it plans to \"consult\" about bikes or is it Toronto specifically that gets special treatment?\n"

        "comment": "If the province intends to force municipalities to remove their dedicated cycling infrastructure in favour of vehicle lanes, they should be required to upload these roadways to the provincial road network at their cost and assume all maintenance and liability for these roads.  More cars means more maintenance and road work which municipalities currently pay for through local tax payer dollars.  It also means less safe conditions and increase injuries/fatalities for pedestrians and cycles which the province should also be liable for.  Furthermore, in the 2022 provincial study, \"Connecting the GGH: A Transportation Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe\", the bill's targeted City of Toronto corridors of Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue, are not identified on the Strategic Goods Movement Network.  Therefore, this bill is unlawful and contradicts the City of Toronto Act.  Any change to Toronto's cycling infrastructure forced on by the province without due process will warrant investgations from the integrity commissioner and Ontario ombudsman.\n"
