If you remove the bike lanes then they will bike on the road or sidewalk which puts drivers and pedestrians at risk as well as the bikers themselves. It's like saying let's get rid of sidewalks to make more room for more cars. We're all just going to be in cars continuously polluting our air and planet. Why not take a good step forward to a green initiative? I thought this was Canada, a country that is progressive.\n"

        "comment": "I'm 38. I've been cycling in this city, and to and through downtown since I was 15. The explosion in cyclists the last number of years with the increase in bike lanes has been amazing. The amount of younger people I see starting to use them is amazing. So many more people are able to safely get about, especially those who might not be able to afford to drive.\nThere is absolutely no reason to do this, there is no real data to support the idea of bike lanes adding to gridlock*. If anything, it's the opposite: the more safe, reliable options you give people to get around the city, the fewer people feel obligated to drive (which reduces the number of cars on the road).\n*The data that has been cited has been comparing what traffic was like /during covid/ when there were less people needing to drive and now. It's not a fair comparison and you know it.\nThe people in the city of Toronto do not want this and it is massive waste of funds that we could be using to solve: public transit, the housing crisis, the mental health wait list crisis and addiction issues. So many other things. But the government wants to spend money instead on ripping out already installed lanes? I thought conservatives were supposed to be good at money, but you continually waste money by cancelling or ripping out projects that will help the people of Toronto - in favour of the people from the suburbs.\nLet Toronto govern Toronto. The Ontario PC party was not elected as Mayor of Toronto. Why are the needs of people commuting into the city and driving across it being prioritized over the people who actually live, work, and spend their money here? The data is showing that businesses with bike lanes installed in front of them are seeing more business, not less.\nSafe cycling infrastructure is the key to solving the gridlock problem and helping to alleviate pollution caused by car traffic. Please focus your time, energy, and funds on what really matters: improving life for the citizens throughout the entire province of Ontario.\nIn addition to bike lanes being a good thing for alleviating traffic, focusing on bike lanes like this is a massive waste of this province's resources and unfair to the residents who do not live in Toronto.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly disagree with this proposal. If anything, we should be adding more bike lanes. Reducing them will mean that cyclists with ride alongside cars, which doesn't speed up traffic and is dangerous. Also, if you discourage cycling that will mean they need to drive, which will increase traffic.\nOverall, this proposal will be worse for both bikers and drivers. We should be investing in more public transportation to get cars off the road instead of always trying to make more lanes.\nPlease do more research on the options instead of wasting tax payer money removing bike lanes that we already paid to put in. This is just common sense.\n"

Having bikes on the road reduces the amount of cars on the road, thus reducing traffic in rush hour. Biking also improves health of those getting exercise with their commute. Bike lanes make biking much safer for these commuters, as well as the many uber eats deliverers.\n"

Traffic has always been bad on Bloor.\nThe difference now is that cyclists are safe, out of the way of cars, making it safe for everyone. Less likely to be doored or have a car side swipe you because they didn\u2019t see you in the lane.\nIf you remove bike lanes, all you\u2019re doing is putting cyclists back into the main traffic. We are still going to be on the roads, making everyone\u2019s commute slower and dangerous.\nSubways are crowded and unsafe, gas and cars are expensive, and now you want to remove one thing of progress that makes living downtown safer and better for the environment.\nMaking room for more traffic only makes more traffic. It doesn\u2019t help speed up anyone\u2019s day.\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nI ride my bicycle almost everyday to get to work, from South Scarborough to downtown core. It takes me an hour each way, around 40km a day. I choose biking for my health, for saving money, and clean energy/environmental concern. A big portion of my ride is on Bloor/Danforth in the designated bike lane. This bike lane is SO IMPORTANT for safety during my ride, and many others. Actually having a separated lane offers a safety net from road accidents and collisions, bad decisions by drivers, drivers getting too close or tailgating.  So many people use these bike paths and will continue to increase in users especially with food delivery services.\nAlso to note: This has been the deadliest year for bicycle vehicle accidents in Toronto, from VisionZeroTO. The nerve of the premier to respond to this in the form of this bill. To waste more taxpaying money on his personal projects and vendettas.\nThe issue for traffic congestion is that our city is expanding at a rate our infrastructure cant handle NOT the bike lanes. More methods of transit helps reduce traffic! TTC is in dire need of upgrading faster and more connections/routes/buses, Metrolinx has not delivered what was promised. More bike lanes need to be built. Incentivise other transit methods, give people rebates for using TTC or bike. Reduce street parking in certain areas. Review traffic directions (perhaps more oneways) and review bottleneck intersections. Review highway tolls and create better roadways. Take notes from other cities that have successfully integrated all transit methods and reduced traffic congestion to make cities more accessible and approachable. So much other things can be done.\nThis bill is an attack on the everyday person just trying to survive. Cities should be for all the people who live and work there, not just drivers.\nKind regards,\nA resident of Toronto\nKatey\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are important urban infrastructure that are a municipal responsibility. The province should stay out of it and let local cities govern their local streets.\nRoads in cities are used by pedestrians, cyclists and motorists. Road conditions need to ensure the safety of ALL road users. Bike lanes are an easy, inexpensive piece of infrastructure that ensures the safety of ALL road users- not just cyclists!\nAside from governance, bike lanes are important elements to RELIEVE traffic congestion. When more people feel safe on their bikes (in bike lanes!) more people will choose to travel by bike, and leave their car at home. This reduces the number of cars on the road, and can relieve car traffic.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is absolutely unnecessary and a waste of time. removing bike lanes will not save any time at all. All it will put cyclists in harms way and make things even more difficult for drivers.\nAs a driver i hate this becaues now i have to worry about cyclists take up space in live lanes of traffic and being unpredictable all over the place. I'd rather have sperated and save lanes of traffic for different modes of transport.\nAs a cyclist it makes me feel less safe and really annoys me. as a result of this i will bike in the middle of the lane and take up a whole lane of traffic so i feel safe instead of biking safely in a bike lane. I know this is going to slow down traffic more and be bad for other drives but living in toronto and commuting to work at a hospital on hospital row it doesn't make sense to drive with how expensive parking is.\nso if you want to make traffic worse and increase gridlock and actually decrease the quality of life of Ontario residents then go ahead.\nIF the preson who came up with this bill knew anything about traffic, you'd know that the best way to reduce traffic is to get the people who don't need to drive out of cars, so that the people who have to drive can get where they're going faster.\n"

I can not imagine how much greater risk I will be under without a bike lane. What am I supposed to do, bike on college? davenport? If you take this lane away and I get injured or die, it is entirely your fault, not the drivers.\nDo any studies exist that show removing bike lanes improves traffic? Is that the main goal? what about business owners? nevermind the cyclists themselves.\nThis is simply cruel legislation that will cause injury and death.\n"

Already, bike lanes are an afterthought, being placed on shared roadways with cars increasing risk to cyclists. More space for cyclists means more cyclists, and more cyclists means fewer cars on the road, solving gridlock problems at the root instead of treating the symptoms. The only benefits this bill has will be for the contractors paid to build these useless highways.\n"
