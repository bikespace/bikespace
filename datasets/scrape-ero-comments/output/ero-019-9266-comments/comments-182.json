Removing bike lanes is regressive and counter-productive to easing traffic congestion.\n"

        "comment": "This initiative is counter-productive, defies logic, and appears motivated out of spite and not data.\nThe reason driving lanes are congested is because there are too many people driving cars in them. A smart solution would be to make more efficient use of the street space. Cars and trucks take up the most space per person out of all forms of land transportation. Micro-mobility devices, including bicycles, allow many more people to use the road while at the same time needing less space. If even a small percentage of people decided to use micro-mobility instead of driving, there would be less traffic.\nBe smart. Do not prevent intelligent people from reducing traffic congestion while at the same time reducing driving lanes. Governments would do everyone a favor by encouraging more bike lanes to be created and getting more people to use them.\n"

        "comment": "Municipalities are responsible for their own roads; it's clear government overreach for the provincial government to be telling municipalities what they can and can't do with their roads.\nBut even beyond that, if we actually want to be solving traffic problems, we should be focusing on the one thing that can actually reduce traffic: reducing the number of cars on the roads. How many decades have we had of adding another lane to our highways, only for the highways to continue being clogged with traffic? Contrast with the pandemic, when there was little traffic on the roads because there were so few cars on the road.\nBike lanes, especially separated ones like we're starting to see in places like Toronto, encourage people to use bikes instead of cars, thus reducing the amount of traffic on the street. And if bike lanes are removed, it'll force bikers into the same lanes cars are trying to use, slowing down traffic and making the lanes less safe for everyone. Or those bikers will take cars instead, increasing the amount of traffic, worsening the problems this legislation is claiming to be trying to fix.\n"

        "comment": "This is bill should not pass for several reasons.\nOne of the central themes and the title of this bill is \"Saving You Time\". I am unsure where the province is getting its data, but biking within the downtown core is one of the fastest ways to get around, not driving. There are many critical destinations within 5-10 km for many folks who live downtown, such as workplace, school, daycares, groceries, etc, that can be accessed by bike much faster than car and transit. Furthermore, to transport 100 bikes requires significantly less space than 100 cars. Another aspect of driving to a destination within downtown is finding parking. This alone can take 10-20 minutes. With a bike, there is no need to circle around the block several times as there is almost always a post available nearby the destination, as well as many BikeShare docks for those using city bikes. The transit in this city is often delayed, diverted, or decommissioned, leaving limited options to get around the city quickly. Travelling by bike within Toronto saves significant amounts of time, therefore this bill would hinder that progress that has been made.\nAnother aspect of this bill is \"Recognizes that accidents and lane closures can worsen traffic congestion and impact the quality of life of Ontarians.\" This is correct. When there is a TEMPORARY reduction of a lane due to construction it often impedes the regular traffic because there is usually a lot of disorganization and lack of space for all users. Cyclists need to merge with ongoing traffic instead of having their own lane which does slow people down. Keeping bikes separate in a designating bike lane, allows for traffic to move much smoother, and keeps those using bikes safe. Cycling should be thought of as a mode of transport just like a car. Even if there are no bike lanes, people still need to use their bikes to get places; however without the right infrastructure, more accidents and congestion will happen. This bill that hinders the city to install bike lanes where necessary therefore could lead to more congestion and accidents due to reduced traffic flow and decreased safety.\nWe live in a city with an incredibly high cost of living. Cycling is a very affordable way to get around and for many, is all that they can afford. Many lower income folks who cycle as their main mode of transport rely heavily on cycling infrastructure to get places safely. Removing this infrastructure will put those who are already very vulnerable at an even higher safety risk.\nWe live in a time where our environmental impact should be minimized as much as possible. Not only is cycling an affordable and healthy mode of transport, it is one of the most \"green\" options aside from walking. We see the impact that poor air quality can have on citizens in very densely packed cities. Why encourage MORE CO2 emissions by prioritizing cars? This only makes the problem worse.\nDoug Ford has said \"Not everyone rides a bike to work\". Well, not everyone drives a car to work either. We are a global city. There is no room for everyone to drive a car around. It is physically impossible. Removing and slowing development of alternate modes of transport is only going to make congestion worse. Making it more difficult to ride your bike will promote more people to resort to their car (if they are able to) putting more cars on the road, and more congestion. It is simple math. One cyclist can be one less car on the road. Alternatively, for folks who do not own a car, they may become increasingly dependent on local transit, putting more strain on the system, which may require more frequent buses/streetcars, and therefore more congestion.\nWithin this bill, the resources required to audit bike lanes so closely, and removing existing lanes would likely cost taxpayers on the order of millions. I thought Doug Ford was all about putting money back into the pockets of Ontarians? This kind of bill would do the exact opposite. So much money and time has been invested into current bike infrastructure in Toronto and we are finally making progress forward. To undo it all would be a huge step backwards and huge cost for taxpayers. Furthermore it was shown that after installation of bike lanes on Bloor St W, business INCREASED for many small businesses. Why would we want to take that away?\nThis bill should seriously consult existing data. It has been shown time and time again that increasing lanes for cars, will TEMPORARILY relieve congestion, but worsens it in the long term. The amount of bike users in this city has gone up, thanks to new infrastructure. This in the long term can IMPROVE congestion because more and more folks will feel safe to use the bike lanes and see how quick it is to get around, resulting in less vehicular traffic and LESS congestion. There is nothing environmentally sound about stopping bike lanes from being built, which should be a strong consideration in this era of climate change. Our city is too dense to accommodate everyone with a car; alternate modes of transport should be ENCOURAGED. The bottom line here is people need to get around by bike whether or not the government wants to admit it. This bill is an insult to those folks, and puts lives at risk. This bill should not pass.\n"

Some of us also use these to aid us to keep active while getting  to see the city. It is an affordable mode of transportation for many. Do not take away the bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "The Framework for bike lanes proposes that provincial approval to allow for the implementation of new bicycle lanes (\u201cbike lanes\u201d) that require the removal of an existing lane of traffic, with the inference that existing bike lanes can be removed if they are deemed by the Province that they are taking up a lane that might be used for traffic.\nTargeting bicycle lanes as proposed in Bill 212 is not going to alleviate road congestion given that the root cause of traffic congestion is the sheer number of automobiles on the roads.  Building more accessible, and safe, avenues by which \"Active Transport\" can be used will result in more use, a process known as \"induced demand\" and directly alleviate congestion by lowering the number of cars on the road.  This has already happened in Montreal following extension of the bike lane network in that city.\nMoreover, the use of bike lanes is associated with a traffic calming effect and an increase in traffic safety for all road users and an uptick in economic demand both in Toronto and also in London, UK where the population density and number of cars is far higher than in any city in Ontario.  Promotion of Active Transport coupled with an increase in investment in public transport (bus, metro) will potentially allow for the use of alternative traffic methods other than the car year round even in a typical Canadian winter.\nThe impact of improving access to active transport is also felt on the decreased cost and increased environmental benefits of both walking and cycling with the reduction in motor vehicle use resulting in less wear on the road surfaces and improving the environment.   The health benefits of increasing walking and cycling on both obesity and diabetes have been well established and promotion of an active lifestyle is likely to provide substantial economic benefits due to a decrease in obesity and concomitant diseases (e.g. diabetes and heart disease).\nGiven all these socioeconomic factors that support increasing the amount of Active Transport in a city, the Government's proposal appears shortsighted and contradictory to current knowledge.  Adding an additional lane at the expense of a bike lane runs into the the induced demand phenomenon and is only a short-term Band-Aid solution at reducing congestion.  Induced demand via lane-building is what makes the Don Valley Parkway and Highway 401 highly congested despite the most recent Highway 401 expansion project that added lanes to the highway.\nMoreover the provision of bike lanes should fall solely under municipal jurisdiction as they impact the local community and I struggle to understand how the Minister, who lives in Brampton, could possibly be aware of the local needs of a resident in Ottawa.  In addition, the nebulous \"assessment criteria\" laid out in the Bill as it currently stands provides no certainty regarding process by which the Province is going to assess both current and future bike lanes and is likely to result in cyclists fearfully coexisting with motor vehicles on our Province's roads as the Premier is well aware from his TVO ride with Mr Singh in 2017.\nTherefore I strongly oppose this Proposed Framework for bike lanes that require removal of a traffic lane.\nWhile I have tried to remain apolitical and only provide data to support my comment, given the track record of this Government regarding important issues like Healthcare, and the Ontario Science Center or Highway 413 together with the significant majority that this Government enjoys, I feel that Bill-212, with this Framework included, will pass anyway.  If so, this Bill is not going to ease traffic congestion and will make Ontario roads much more dangerous for Active Transport users, resulting in detrimental effects for every Ontarian who drives, walks or bikes.\n"
