        "comment": "I do not support the Provincial government's decision to remove and restrict the construction and development of bike lanes. It is demonstrated beyond doubt that bike lanes improve traffic congestion and road safety for all modes of transit and promote a healthy economy. New development relies on the proximity of bike lanes to justify reduced parking requirements and increased density. Bike lanes are a key piece of infrastructure for cities and should be the responsibility of the City, not the Province.\n"

        "comment": "I do not see why the Ontario government should be in the business of choosing favourites as regards modes of transportation. This legislation serves only to legitimize and further our dependency on the motor vehicle as the only viable means of transport. Such thinking is short-sighted, selfish, and will cripple us in a future wherein cars are no longer the best means of transportation. Not only that, it will do nothing to ameliorate gridlock or save time, as it will induce demand for more cars. This legislation is terrible and ought to be scrapped.\n"

Toronto is the most dangerous Canadian city for cyclists. Not only roads are unsafe, many drivers are not aware of basic responsibilities such as keeping one meter distance from the cyclist. I really hope that some programs cultivate our citizens about their rights and responsibilities. Meanwhile, making more bike lanes give space to cyclist and increase their safety.\nPlease make more bike lanes to save lives and do not remove the existing ones.\nThank you\n"

        "comment": "As someone who lives downtown and also has a vehicle, I think getting rid of the Bloor and University bike lanes is a poor idea. The idea that having the cyclists on the roads taking up their own lane is going to help traffic is absurd, and ignoring the fact that this will 100% cause more cyclist accidents and deaths is actually pretty on par for Ford. The traffic congestion downtown is only ever going to be decreased by making it easier to access the core without using a car.\n"

        "comment": "Reducing bike lanes to accommodate for more traffic lanes will NOT improve congestion, it will instead take AWAY a mode of transportation which is overall beneficial and sustainable, biking. When more people are able to bike because bike lanes and infrastructure make them feel protected and confident that they will not need to cross paths with cars, more people will bike, as we see in cities like Amsterdam and across Ontario. Imagine a city where you didn't need to own a car? Life would be more affordable and Ontarians would highly benefit from it. This bill is a step in the wrong direction, and should not be even considered for a moment.\n"

There are numerous studies that show the benefits of bike lanes to all commuters, not just people who bike. This is a HUGE overstep by the provincial government to think that they can decide what is best for cities, especially when things like Transportation Master Plans and Official Plans exist. This policy should be struck down, and never should have even been proposed in the first place. Focus on the terrible healthcare system and education system, rather than wasting time on Doug's passion projects.\n"

        "comment": "As a driver, and someone who often experiences gridlock, I am strongly opposed to the Ford government's proposal under Bill 212 to reduce and remove existing bike lanes.\nFirst and foremost, I fear that reducing bike lanes will cost lives. I have a brother who is an avid Toronto cyclist, riding many hours per week. I am concerned that with a reduction in bike lanes, my sibling, and others like him, who have come to rely on safe bike lanes, will be at greater risk for collisions with motorized vehicle traffic.\nAnd, I strongly oppose the Ford government\u2019s nose in decisions that are the responsibility of the municipalities. Since in many of the areas affected, the PCs have no seats to lose, the Ford government wields unprecedented power to take decision making away from municipalities. I am tired of this interference in municipal matters. The bullying must stop!\nI question the costs in removing existing bike lanes, especially since there is no criteria established for which lanes will be a risk. Tens of millions of dollars will be spent to go backwards, removing lanes that were built within the last five years. And, let us not forget the construction disruption that will ensue to remove existing bike lanes!\nMoreover, creating more space for vehicle traffic does not reduce gridlock, according to the latest research. Adding lanes for motorized vehicles only encourages more people to choose to take their cars, rather than using public transit, particularly when bike lanes are absent. One has only to take a look among many US cities to see the problems created by a priority on vehicle traffic. Clearly, a better choice is to throw dollars into improved public transportation and add bike lanes.\nA better road forward is to also look more closely at the chaos that construction projects cause. Often, we see lane closures when workers and machinery and evidence of work are missing. This problem could certainly be more closely monitored to ease gridlock.\nFor safety, construction costs and to continue to provide choice among our Ontarians on how we move around our towns and cities, I urge the provincial government to scrap Bill 212.\n"

        "comment": "This act flies in the face of environmental assessment and the reason it exists. We are in an unprecedented global warming event, and instead of working towards addressing climate change, the government is actively taking steps to reduce such efforts, and exacerbate the problem.\nOntario does not need a new highway on some of the most fertile land in Canada, in a vastly underpopulated region. Expanding the suburbs is not the way forward - as urban sprawl has been cited as a leading cause of climate change [David Suzuki foundation; attached paper].\nBuilding such a highway without the impact on local wildlife, water basins, and land is not only irresponsible but reprehensible.\nSimilarly, for a conservative government to spend millions to remove existing infrastructure (bike lanes) that have been shown to reduce traffic and increase mobility of thousands of people seems short-sighted and pandering to commuters who drive (and contribute to climate change and traffic).\nRemoving bike lanes will only put the cyclist back on the road, either as drivers or as cyclist taking up space. It will not reduce congestion (see attached report). This is an uninformed idea, that only causes damage, and very little benefit for Ontarians.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my concerns regarding the proposed bill that requires provincial approval for new bike lanes and imposes additional data collection requirements on municipalities. I believe this bill could hinder the development of essential bike infrastructure and negatively impact our communities. I urge you to reconsider and support the expansion of bike lanes for the following reasons:\n1. Local Decision-Making:\n   The bill mandates provincial approval for new bike lanes if it involves removing a vehicle lane. Local governments are more attuned to their community's needs and traffic patterns. Empowering municipalities to make these decisions can lead to more effective and tailored solutions for reducing traffic congestion and promoting sustainable transportation.\n2. Data Collection:\n   While collecting data on existing bike lanes is important, it should not be used to obstruct the development of new bike infrastructure. Instead, this data should be utilized to improve and expand bike lanes, showcasing their benefits in reducing traffic and pollution.\n3. Exemption for Ongoing Projects:\n   The bill exempts projects already in construction or with awarded contracts from the new approval process. This exemption acknowledges the importance of ongoing projects. However, it should be extended to future projects to ensure continuous development of bike infrastructure without bureaucratic delays.\n4. Environmental Considerations:\n   The bill states that environmental impacts will be considered when evaluating new bike lanes. Bike lanes inherently promote environmental sustainability by reducing vehicle emissions and encouraging eco-friendly transportation. Prioritizing bike lanes can significantly contribute to our environmental goals and public health.\nSupporting Bikes:\n- Health Benefits: Cycling promotes physical activity, reducing the risk of chronic diseases and improving overall health.\n- Traffic Reduction: More bike lanes can decrease the number of cars on the road, alleviating traffic congestion.\n- Environmental Impact: Bikes produce zero emissions, helping to combat climate change and improve air quality.\n- Economic Savings: Cycling is a cost-effective mode of transportation, saving money on fuel and vehicle maintenance.\nBy supporting bike lanes, we can create healthier, more sustainable, and less congested communities. I urge you to reject this bill and instead focus on policies that promote and expand bike infrastructure for the benefit of all.\nThank you for considering my perspective.\n"

        "comment": "Cyclists are traffic too and you\u2019re removing a lane which means you\u2019re making the city traffic worse. We have so many accidents causing death of cyclists and huge damages to the drivers\u2019 cars themselves so the best way to move forward is to keep the bike lanes and educate everybody how to co-exist through promoting good biking and motorist etiquette. In Willowdale BIA, so many constituents complain about the amount of bike delivery people going so fast on a sidewalk of Yonge street, and some were terribly injured because of it. Keeping a bike lane here would improve traffic, not removing.\nAlso I see you trying to start a culture war between motorists and cyclists. Trying to distract us from the housing crisis and underfunding of health care? Well try again. Motorists bike too! From a quick research on Google, it\u2019s easy to find facts about how bike lanes benefit us all.\n"
