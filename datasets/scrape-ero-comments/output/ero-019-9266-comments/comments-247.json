        "comment": "The content of my comment has been partially copy/pasted based on an existing comment, but I feel that it represents my opinion on this bill. Generally I feel that this is overreaching beyond the authority that the provincial government should have over municipalities, and does not address any of the real needs of the province. This act, like many put forward by the current administration, appears to be heavily targeted towards development in Toronto, and it continues to appear that our Premier wishes he was the mayor or Toronto and not the Premier of the province as a whole.\nIn addition to the bike lane issue, I am extremely concerned that the title of this bill is described as addressing bike lanes only; while the bill itself also contains major exemptions related to the Highway 413 project. This is dishonest and misleading at best.\nThe stated, abstract objective of this Act is to reduce \u201cgridlock,\u201d using means which are proven to be detrimental to public health and safety, mobility and access to Ontario communities for all people, environmental protection, and will aid in worsening the ongoing climate emergency.\nDespite having the authority to do so per the Municipal Act, requiring provincial approval for construction of new bike lanes where they \u201creplace a lane of traffic\u201d is a dramatic overreach of government authority in the affairs of municipalities. This is meddlesome and suggests the provincial government doesn\u2019t have faith or trust in municipalities to manage their own affairs, and further suggests that the provincial government isn\u2019t interested in local democracy\u2014bike lanes aren\u2019t constructed without warning; they are built only after an extensive planning process, which includes considerable research and community input.\nFurthermore, it is an objective fact that more car lanes will not reduce traffic congestion: the concept of Induced Demand indicates that with more car lanes, there is more traffic. This phenomenon has been observed all over the world. If this government were serious about \u201creducing gridlock,\u201d it would be making investments to the tune of several billion dollars to prioritize development and construction of extensive transit projects all over the province, and would invest considerable time, money and effort into the construction of more, comprehensive cycling networks. One more bike on the road is one less car; bikes take up far less space on the road than a single occupancy vehicle, thereby making more room for those who are or who must drive.\nIt is important to mention as well that the three bike lanes Premier Ford has pledged to remove in Toronto also see thousands of users per day\u2014that\u2019s literally thousands of cars that are off the road as a result. Local businesses are more successful in areas with bike lanes (this is easily proven looking at the Bloor Bike Lane reports prepared by City staff in Toronto), and various Toronto BIAs have already come out in support of bike lanes and the detrimental impact their removal would have on local businesses.\nCycling is also the far healthier option: physical activity leads to better health outcomes which leads to less money required for healthcare services.\nInstallation of bike lanes also have the added advantage of making the entire streetscape safer to use for all mobility modes; cars, bikes, pedestrians, and all others. Their existence can save the lives of cyclists and many others. Six cyclists have died on Toronto streets this year, and that is six too many; innocent lives lost because the victims were trying to get across town. Utterly senseless, with families shattered as a result.\nPertaining to bike lanes, my final comment is that the existence of these lanes gives all people greater access to their municipality. Those without the financial means to own a car, pay for insurance, parking, gas, etc. are more able to traverse their municipality for work, recreation, and to support the local economy. A car-centric community is a community that closes itself off to a considerable portion of its population.\nOn the topic of exempting 413 lands from environmental assessments, this is yet another short-sighted policy that will result in disastrous outcomes for the environment. The area where the highway is intended to be built is environmentally sensitive land. Once paved over, that land is lost as a carbon sink, a natural habitat for native flora and fauna, and as a floodplain/natural flood control measure\u2014forever. The proposal that this highway should be exempted from any environmental assessment to expedite development suggests the government doesn\u2019t care whatsoever about the environment and, again, is not serious about eliminating gridlock: as mentioned above, the concept of induced demand means that on completion, it will create more gridlock and spew more harmful greenhouses gas emissions into the atmosphere. Here, again, I must emphasize that if the government is serious about reducing gridlock, the only way forward is to invest in and build a massive public transit infrastructure, and augment municipal streets with alternative means of mobility, such as bike lanes.\nI question whether any planners, environmentalists, engineers or any other credentialed experts were consulted at all in the creation of this bill.\nIn summary, Bill 212 is a backwards approach to \u201creducing\u201d gridlock which will have the complete opposite effect of its stated objective: gridlock will become worse, public safety will be worse, local economies will suffer, the environment will be senselessly, irreparably destroyed, and health outcomes for Ontarians will be worse, which will end up costing us more. This bill should not move forward.\n"

        "comment": "\"Ontario is looking to fight gridlock and get drivers where they need to go faster\". Why drivers and not simply people? Are my transportation needs less important simply because I'm choosing a bicycle over my car for as many of them as I can?\nI've spent years cycling to work, to take my kids to daycare, to go and spend money at local businesses, to visit friends and family etc. It's baffling and disappointing that the current provincial government either does not understand that people cycle for all sorts of practical and essential reasons, or pretends not to. The Premier's well-documented personal disdain for cycling and cyclists should not stand in the way of municipalities making well-reasoned decisions about transportation infrastructure. It defies logic that the province is somehow better equipped to make hyper-local decisions like this.\nOn top of all of this: building more lanes for vehicles leads to induced demand. I'm not including references to support what I'm saying here because there is a significant body of research which does so. I already pay plenty of provincial tax so that the provincial government can develop relevant expertise, which it is manifestly failing to do in this case.\n"

        "comment": "Removing the bike lanes is an extreme overreach of power and has no benefit whatsoever to the city constituents (Drivers, Pedestrians, and cyclists).\nIf traffic management is the goal, removing the bike lanes in no way reduces the amount of vehicles on the road or the amount of construction on the road. Instead, you force those who would cycle to either drive their car which in turn increases traffic and congestion OR the bike will just be in the middle of the lane (which they are allowed to do and arguably safer) since there are no bike lanes.\nAdditionally, increasing funding/spend on public transit (as well as completing long overdue projects like the LRT) will help with congestion as you then provide a more reliable means of transit for people.\nThe obsession with cars is mind-boggling when the most efficient cities are not built around cars, but pedestrians, cyclists, and then cars (in that order).\nLeave the governance and control of the bike lanes to the City and focus on the provincial issues.\n"

        "comment": "Gridlock has been a concern for ever since I can remember in Toronto. I've been hearing about gridlock and seeing it with my own eyes for 20 plus years. You have many major highways with many lanes spilling into a city with narrow lanes, bound by the physical limitation of buildings. If cars are continually promoted, it is inevitable that this will continue.\nTraffic jams are nothing new and the addition of the bike lanes in this city has not increased gridlock in the long term, but has made thousands of people not bring cars into the city. When I worked in the financial district, I saw doctors, lawyers, and other business people take bikes around the core, because it would get jammed up with cars and with streetcars getting blocked by cars. This proves that it is not just a mode of transit for the poor, but a smart choice of getting around for those that have the money to afford a car as well. I know many thousands of other people use bicycles to get around daily. Additionally, many businesses on Bloor, and other areas, have reported increases in business when the lanes were installed.\nI have never been held back from arriving somewhere on time because of my bicycle or blocked up traffic because of it. I, myself, gave my vehicle up when I moved to Toronto because my bicycle gets me places that cars get stuck in, whether there's a car accident, a broken down car, a car stuck in the middle of an intersection turning on a light they shouldn't be, and probably the biggest problem we're facing right now, construction, that reduces lanes pretty much everywhere in the city, and is being forced on this city by your own OMB with a 97% approval rate for all building proposals submitted, regardless of how many elderly on fixed incomes are in the current buildings on site.\nAs your government forces these developments, we need a diversity of modes of transit and need to start creating better, safer communities, of which drivers in cars, time and time again, make more dangerous by speeding, by changing lanes improperly, not stopping for stop signs, not checking blindspots when turning or opening car doors, zipping through intersections while making rights on red lights. I counted five cars the other day whip through without stopping at Parliament and Carlton's intersection on a right hand turn while the light was red. I see people daily rush red lights onto Lakeshore under the Gardiner. Running red lights is one of the top reasons for car accidents in this province. I see people run stop signs daily with their cars on Queen's Quay, and have seen two separate incidents where parents with babies in strollers were almost hit while walking across the crosswalk. 18 people walking or cycling have been killed in this city in 2024 so far. The numbers have been going down since 2016 when it was 78 people and I feel cycling infrastructure plays a big role in that.\nWhen I compare the danger of people on bikes doing the same things that vehicles do, because both road users abuse road laws, of course I would want everyone to obey the rules, but if I had to choose between bicycles and cars breaking the law, I would rather have a city full of bicycles doing it than tonnes and tonnes of metal able to easily kill a person. At just 45 kilometres an hour, a pedestrian's chances of survival is less than 50% of surviving a car's impact. Pedestrians have almost no chance of surviving an impact at 80 kilometres an hour and roads like Jarvis and Lakeshore often have people driving that fast up and down it.\nYour own research and much other research, both locally and globally, reinforces that bike lanes have a net positive impact. Each time a lane has been added here in Toronto, and places like Hamilton, I've seen more women on bicycles, more families on bicycles, more children on bicycles. Car traffic slows making our disastrous amount of human deaths by cars in Toronto much lower and much easier to avoid. Car insurance in this province and this area is brutal because of car accidents. We have drivers who are now going through a graduated licensing system that is less stringent and more rushed through based on your government's alterations to it, adding to the already brutal drivers I see on the roads when I both drive my car and ride my bike. Not to mention your failure to actually be able to correctly prosecute all of the drunk drivers over the last couple of years.\nWe have two massive transit projects that are massively delayed and the province should be focusing on these. I would say to be wise with our tax dollars, but any look at the misuse of federal money for our healthcare, forcing the destruction of Ontario Place over night and keeping the deal secret, forcing the 413 and again exempting it from an EA, closing The Ontario Science Centre when fixing the current one would be cheaper, your neglect of our healthcare system and education system, it's clear that's not a priority.\nYour vilification of vulnerable road users who are keeping our air clean, trying to reduce congestion, get to work on time, and keep our communities safer is smoke and mirrors away from the actual problems you are failing to address. You are clogging up our tax dollars that have already been invested and projects that are already on the move in many municipalities. I shouldn't be surprised though since your government pulled out electric vehicle charging stations only to put them back in later. Don't let this be what you do with our bicycle lanes as well once you realize this was a poor decision.\nBicycle infrastructure, when compared to all other types of infrastructure for movement, is far cheaper and easier to install. 5.7 million unique trips were taken with just city bikes alone last year as reported by CBC News, and 2024 was on pace in early September to beat that record again. The parking for city bikes takes up very little room compared to vehicle parking. The global trend in major cities our size is to have denser more efficient cities. You are forcing the density, but now want to force municipalities to back out of the efficiency.\nEmergency response times are being reduced in areas where bike lanes have been installed, as reported by Fire Services at one of the public consultations for the bike lanes on Bloor.\nOn top of that, many of the leading causes of death in Canadians can be avoided if more people were able to bike safely. Hypertension, many heart conditions, many other ailments, and almost 2,000 road deaths and 118,853 injuries in 2022 in the province of Ontario would be greatly reduced if your government wasn't forcing cars on everyone, forcing highways on everyone, forcing inefficient suburbs on everyone, and pushing cities to grow and swallow up small towns and farmland.\nOur transit can be unreliable. Our cars get stuck. The elderly need to have communities they can walk in and bike in where they're not dependent on cars that become unsafer for them to operate with age. And with Baby Boomers getting to those ages, we need more options for this large portion of our population so they're not isolated. It would be more helpful if things like sidewalks were installed in areas where people can't currently walk, but would be able to.\nBike lane usage is increasing all over the city. Food delivery services are used by so many that GO Train schedules have been altered to accommodate food delivery drivers from Brampton. Some angry people say they never see people in the lanes, but in many instances, it's because we don't get stuck and can continue on.\nAs an aside, it's also interesting that this is on the Environmental Registry of Ontario, the organization that you are actively ignoring and bulldozing over, by exempting yourself from environmental assessments, the heritage act, having cancelled the credit system we had with California and Quebec that has forced us into the federal carbon tax plan, all while gutting conservation authorities, and muzzling scientists. I doubt there's much  environment you want to actually protect, especially while stealing farmland from people in Wilmot County and Vaughan. I'm actually surprised you didn't get some type of exemption from even posting this on this website.\nCities are growing, changing, and evolving and we need to plan for the future, both the climate, our social interactions, our health, and cities' livability. There are growing pains with the lanes on Bloor in Etobicoke, and, yes, there has been admitted congestion growth, but that is being worked on with signal upgrades and other measures. Yes, there are definite reductions in lane usage in winter, but for the people that use them during those times, it saves their lives. And that's the most important point I want to make. Your government removing lanes kills people. That's why doctors laid down their lives on Jarvis when those lanes were removed almost a decade ago.\nYour government needs to focus on real issues and not how municipalities, who have studied their own streets, and have very different traffic flows and issues between them, are implementing their infrastructure, or, at the very least, work with them rather than bulldozing everything through, like your corrupt government has been. Your choice is literally to save a couple of minutes of car time, which is already being researched on how to reduce it, or killing people. Save my life, please.\nA tax-paying citizen, car driver, pedestrian, and person who rides a bike\n"

With this bill, we could lose all the ground we have gained over and be prevented from building more bike lanes. Not only that, but money could be wasted on removing existing lanes.\nBike lanes do not increase congestion and adding lanes of car traffic only makes it worse.

I strongly reject the arguments presented by the Conservative government in support of this bill, which seem to be rooted in short-sighted concerns about traffic congestion and parking availability. Research consistently demonstrates that well-designed cycling infrastructure not only enhances safety for cyclists but also improves overall traffic flow and reduces congestion in the long term (Toronto Centre for Active Transportation, 2018). Additionally, studies show that businesses in areas with protected bike lanes tend to see an increase in sales, driven by greater foot and bicycle traffic (New York City Department of Transportation, 2014). These facts contradict the government\u2019s claims that bike lanes negatively impact local businesses and inconvenience motorists.

        "comment": "This proposal is a terrible idea. Study after study has shown that building more lanes for cars only increases congestion, whereas bike lanes encourage people to take more sustainable forms of transit that take up far less space and thus ease congestion. It's a fallacy to suggest that the cause of traffic in the GTA is bike lanes.\nIf the government really wants to save Ontarians time and help us get around our cities more easily, it would be far better off to invest in MORE bike lanes or at the very last keep the ones we have. When there are more bike lanes, cycling becomes safer. When cycling is safer, more people do it. When more people do it, there are fewer cars on the road and everyone gets where they need to go faster and more safely.\nThe environmental and health benefits are icing on the cake.\nSpeaking personally, I am a hard-working youth worker living in midtown and working downtown. I ride in the Yonge Street, Bloor Street and Sherbourne Street bike lanes almost every day to get to work. Firstly: you're welcome because yes I am choosing a sustainable option for everyone's future. Secondly: these bike lanes make me feel safe in the city. Ripping out these bike lanes means it's far less feasible for me to continue making this good choice, and significantly increases the likelihood of me getting hurt while I'm on my way to work to support young Torontonians.\nPitting road users against each other is just playing to Ford's base. Is it good politics? Maybe. Is it a good transit, environmental or health policy? Absolutely not. This bill would be taking us backwards not forwards.\n"

I.e., in a given period of time, a bike lane can transport a greater number of people than a car-lane. Thus, for the purposes of solving traffic congestion, a bike lane will reduce the overall amount of traffic.\nAdditionally, bikes are far safer and more quieter than cars. Thus, by incentivizing the switch from cars to cycles, city roads become a lot quieter (i.e., less noise pollution) and less deadly for pedestrians and non-motor vehicle owners.\nHaving bike lanes is a huge win for the city, its residents and its traffic management.
