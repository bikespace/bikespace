We should be encouraging less drivers coming downtown by creating more pedestrian and cycling lanes - this will make it safer for pedestrians and cyclists as well as encourage more tourism. Similar to how things are set up in Europe.\nToo many cars downtown makes it a miserable experience for everyone, not to mention more unsafe. Environmentally, more cars will make the city more polluted. For these reasons I suggest you reconsider this Bill.\n"

        "comment": "Ontario's \"Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act,\" aimed at enhancing transportation infrastructure and reducing traffic congestion, may seem appealing initially. However, a deeper look reveals several issues that could exacerbate the very problems it seeks to solve, leading to negative long-term consequences.\n1. **Overreliance on Expanding Road Networks**\nA key element of the Act is expanding roadways and highways to ease traffic. While this appears to be a straightforward solution, it overlooks the concept of induced demand, which suggests that adding more roads encourages more driving, ultimately increasing congestion. Expanding infrastructure often results in more vehicles filling the new lanes, worsening traffic rather than alleviating it. This cycle of continual expansion is unsustainable and could create a \u201cbigger is worse\u201d scenario.\n2. **Environmental Impact and Urban Sprawl**\nThe Act\u2019s emphasis on road construction neglects the environmental consequences, such as increased carbon emissions that contradict Ontario\u2019s climate goals. Building and maintaining highways requires substantial resources, and higher car usage contributes to pollution. Additionally, expanding highways fosters urban sprawl, as new developments emerge along these routes, leading to the loss of green spaces, ecosystem damage, and added pressure on municipal services in suburban areas.\n3. **Neglect of Public Transit and Active Transportation**\nThe focus on road expansion overlooks the importance of public transportation and active transportation (walking, cycling) in addressing traffic congestion. To truly reduce gridlock, Ontario should prioritize investments in public transit systems like buses, subways, and commuter trains, offering alternatives to driving. The Act should also promote safe cycling lanes and pedestrian paths to support sustainable transportation. By ignoring these aspects, the Act misses the core need for more sustainable travel options.\n4. **Lack of Demand Management Strategies**\nRather than just expanding roadways, Ontario should consider traffic demand management strategies. Approaches like congestion pricing, which charges vehicles during peak hours in high-traffic areas, have proven effective in cities like London and New York. The Act fails to implement such measures, missing an opportunity to manage traffic flow and encourage the use of public transit, leading to a continued reliance on private cars and worsening congestion.\n5. **Impact on Local Communities and Quality of Life**\nThe expansion of roads and highways could harm local communities, especially residential areas that may experience increased noise, pollution, and disruption to local businesses. Communities could be negatively affected by expanding roadways, with some residents potentially displaced due to construction or gentrification. This could lower the quality of life for those in affected neighborhoods.\n6. **Missed Opportunity for Innovative Solutions**\nInstead of sticking with traditional, car-dependent approaches, the Ontario government should explore innovative transportation options, such as investing in shared mobility services (carpooling, ride-hailing, autonomous vehicles) and smart traffic management systems that optimize flow. These modern technologies are not sufficiently addressed in the Act, suggesting a continued focus on outdated infrastructure solutions that may no longer be effective in meeting today\u2019s challenges.\n**Conclusion**\nAlthough the \"Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act\" aims to solve Ontario\u2019s traffic issues, its focus on expanding road infrastructure and neglect of alternative transportation methods are short-sighted and ineffective over time. The emphasis on road construction is likely to worsen congestion, harm the environment, and contribute to urban sprawl. To truly address gridlock, Ontario should prioritize sustainable transportation options like public transit, active transportation infrastructure, and demand management strategies such as congestion pricing. Without these measures, the Act risks perpetuating the very problems it intends to solve.\n"

The bike lanes have also encouraged people to cycle more and use other green modes of transportation. If the province would like to support he city with reducing traffic, please work with the city's plans, and continue to improve public transit within the city, and between the the city and the GTA. Don't allow the province to spend our tax dollars to remove beautifully designed bike lines in Toronto! Toronto will continue to grow like any major city and removing bike lanes for more cars will not solve the problem in the long wrong. Toronto needs a long term strategic plan to support the growing population that is environmentally friendly and reduces pollution. Trying to make more room for cars will fail!

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes will not improve traffic. If anything they have and will continue to improve mobility across the city, as more people live near bike lanes for trips beyond commuting - shopping, visiting friends, going to restaurants, generally the kinds of mid range activities that we absolutely should be encouraging people to do by bike, as that would in fact reduce the number of cars on the road.\nAnd Toronto is absolutely bike friendly in the winter, if we're as diligent about clearing snow from bike lanes as we are from roads - only a small proportion of the time is the ground completely covered in snow.\nEmergency services are not impacted by bike lanes - again, the actual evidence speaks against lanes having negative effects.\nThe real solutions - which we need to be brave enough to implement, are removing street parking on arterials, which would anger drivers (but necessarily), and encouraging alternative modes of transportation, of which bike lanes are of course one. This will require real vision and well thought out policy making, but would offer real solutions that any government could proudly tout.\n"

        "comment": "This is a terrible proposal that focuses on entirely the wrong issues. The bike lanes have made commuting to work safer and more efficient for thousands of taxpaying residents of Toronto. They have increased traffic to businesses along these corridors. Under no circumstances should Environmental Assessments be skipped for any proposed projects, especially given how much more frequent catastrophic weather events are becoming.\nAfter the installation of the Bloor street bike lanes, Toronto saw a 40\u201390% increase in cyclists,  a 56% decrease in cyclist injuries,  as well as a decrease in pedestrian and driver industries.  Bike lanes are better for business, better for health and safety of Ontarians, and working to undo that is just throwing money away for a cause that will increase harm Ontario citizens and Toronto business owners.\nRather, the province should commit to increasing the safety and efficiency of biking infrastructure to incentivize residents cycling within downtown cores and leaving the roads for the out-of-towners. Take the money you plan to burn on this proposal and spend it where we need it -- public health, housing, and education.\n"

        "comment": "I am strongly opposed to the Bill 212.\nWhile am in support of the province looking for solutions to the real problems the bill intends to solve, I do not believe the proposed solutions would succeed. Additionally, experts and their evidence do not support the solutions Bill 212 and in fact suggests the exact opposite; congestion is not decreased by adding car lanes or new highways to new suburban development. An overwhelming majority of studies indicate that congestion decreased by making it easier for residents to travel by means other than the private automobile, namely public transportation and cycling. Additionally, studies indicate the the larger issue of congestion can be tackled by changing how we build and develop our towns and cities; by encouraging mixed land-use development and medium density residential housing.\nMaking cycling harder and less safe, skipping environmental assessments, and removing protections from provincial expropriations are equivalent to taking an expired pain medication for a broken leg. While it might look somewhat helpful at first, not only does it not addresses the original issue but it might in fact cause more harm than good.\n"

However, I make use of bike lanes almost every single day and they make commutes faster and easier. Without them I am actively a part of traffic and often have to be on high alert to ensure drivers are paying attention to the shared lanes. Without them commutes would be longer, commutes would be more dangerous and inconvenient. Drivers will not be looking to share the lane and will prioritize their own travel.\n"

This bill threatens the heart of our communities, the environment, and the safety of Ontarians. By exempting Highway 413 from the Environmental Assessment Act, this legislation allows irreversible harm to sensitive Greenbelt lands, which are vital for protecting our air, water, and wildlife. Environmental Defence has shown that this highway will destroy over 400 acres of critical natural habitat.\nHighway 413 won\u2019t solve congestion\u2014it will make it worse. Experts around the world have proven that building more highways leads to induced demand, creating more traffic and pollution. If we want to reduce gridlock, we need smart, forward-thinking solutions like better public transit and bike lanes. Every bike on the road is one less car, which means less pollution, less noise, and safer streets for everyone.\nRemoving bike lanes in Toronto under Bill 212 is a huge step backward. These lanes don\u2019t just help cyclists\u2014they make streets safer for pedestrians and drivers too. Plus, local businesses benefit from increased foot and bike traffic. Why would we take away something that helps people get around safely and supports our economy?\nHaving worked in the sustainability industry and being very passionate about climate change. Please reconsider this bill. Ontario needs infrastructure that brings people together, not policies that divide us and harm our future. Let\u2019s invest in sustainable, community-centered transportation solutions that benefit everyone.\nSincerely,\nConcerned citizen\n"
