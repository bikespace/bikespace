        "comment": "This proposal will make traffic worse by encouraging more people to drive. It will make roads less safe! And it is uninformed policy supported by zero data, often supported in public statements from the Minister and Premier citing irrelevant data from 2011 (and not admitting this data is out of date and from before the bike lanes were installed). This small a massive waste of money as much of this construction happened recently, is now being undone, and will probably be redone in the future because this change is very stupid.\n"

I do not feel safe biking on Spadina and would argue that my presence sans bike lane actually increases gridlock as cars squeeze into the middle /left lane to go around me. On bloor on the other hand everyone has their lanes and can swim along safely.\n"

        "comment": "This legislation is a travesty.  You are actively ignoring best-practice guidelines for safe streets, and are putting the convenience of saving a few seconds for drivers (including, conveniently, the Minister of Transportation who refuses to take public transportation to work) ahead of the safety of all road users and environmental concerns.\nMore people will be injured on the roads because of this policy.  Full stop.  A letter from physicians and researchers at the University of Toronto:  https://healthydebate.ca/2024/10/topic/legislation-road-design-safety-t\u2026\nLike many policies of the current government, it seems that Doug Ford is more interested in pretending that he is, in fact, mayor of Toronto than of dealing with major issues that fall under the provincial banner, like healthcare and education.\nThis addendum to the legislation also ignores the many actual causes of gridlock, including an unregulated ride-sharing industry, a refusal to toll public highways (and the unfortunate decision to sell highway 407 by the previous Conservative government), construction blocking active lanes, and near-constant on-street parking, and a lack of reliable and consistent public transit options in certain areas.\nThe government would be better focused on speeding up Metrolinx construction of new transit options than putting the blame on cyclists.  Or perhaps everyone who currently rides a bike (including both commuters and delivery couriers) should magically be able to afford a car, so that we can actively contribute to the gridlock that this legislation claims to be interested in solving?\n"

        "comment": "I've been a PC voter for every election and I'm also a cyclist. Two reasons I've started cycling to work, 1) improved health benefits and 2) safer bike infrastructure on major streets. Removing these bike lanes will do no favour for cyclists or motorists. Bikes and cars will share that lane and it will cause more chaos and more slowdowns, not to mention significantly increases the risk of collisions.\nThe Province should spend their time and efforts improving what was uploaded to them, i.e. the Gardiner Expressway. The Province should not be meddling with municipal issues and create this war against cyclists. This policy hurts and, along with the rest of the poor decisions that the Ford goverment  is making, starting to make me reconsider whether the PCs have their priorities straight.\n"

        "comment": "I commute to work on bike via Bloor Street  daily. The removal of any section of the Bloor bike lanes would be detrimental to my ability to safely transit within the city. I believe that implementing this proposal will cause the opposite effect, as it will encourage cyclists like myself to drive downtown, ultimately increasing car traffic.\nThe removal of these lanes would be incredibly disappointing to both me and my community members.\n"

        "comment": "It\u2019s hard to imagine a bigger waste of provincial resources than this proposal. If the city consults with the people who live and work in that community and they agree that there should be a bike lane, why would the province ever need to step in? To defend whose interests? People who have driven in from other municipalities?\nNot only is it ridiculous from a political-economic standpoint, but the proposal likely wouldn\u2019t even achieve its goal. Study after study shows that adding more lanes for cars does not actually reduce congestion. Construction makes congestion worse; construction of the kind required to remove (popular and well used) bike lanes.\nBike lanes make drivers and cyclists safer, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and encourage a healthy lifestyle. Allowing the province to veto\u2014or, even more absurdly, force the removal of\u2014a bike lane is simply a way for the government to drum up support among its car-reliant base at the expense of the rights and desires of those living and working along these bike routes.\n"

They give us freedom and mobility. Bike lanes save lives.\nThe proposed legislative changes will not reduce congestion, will increase risk to public safety, and move away from evidence-based practices.

        "comment": "This proposed removal of busy bike lanes will make congestion worse, rather than improving it. The data is very clear on this.\nRemoving these bike lanes will also lead to deaths. We should not allow the government to take actions that lead to deaths, especially when the stated reason have no basis in reality.\nA huge percentage of vehicle traffic on those streets are now cyclists, which means they aren\u2019t clogging up the streets with cars. Remove the lanes, and traffic will get worse again, and more dangerous.\nI know two people who died after being hit by vehicles while cycling. In both cases, their lives could have been saved by separated bike lanes. Killing cyclists to make Doug Ford feel better is not the answer.\n"

        "comment": "I see logic has no place in Ford or the Minister of Transportation's decision making process.\nHoping there's MPPs out there willing to think for themselves and go outside their party lines to stand up for Ontarians on this issue. Vote NO to Bill 212!\nHere are some good reasons to vote No to Bill 212:\n1) bike lanes create safer roads for ALL\n2) bike lanes reduce congestion\n3) bike lanes contribute to sustainable and environmentally friendly lifestyle choices\n4) cycling improves citizens' health and bike lanes make cycling more accessible, so more people can choose healthy habits when they have access and feel safe cycling in bike lanes\n5) bike lanes provide critical commuting options for people in cities\n6) more people cycling = less cars on the road. This reduces traffic!\n7) municipalities have the information to make bike lane infrastructure decisions based on their communities needs\n8) provincial government will be creating NEW / ADDITIONAL / UNNECESSARY red tape for municipalities to improve transportation and life for their citizens\n9) adding redundant layer of approval at provincial level will require more of my money to go to government with no benefit!\n10) forcing the removal of existing bike lanes is fiscally irresponsible, especially since we JUST built these lanes. You would be forcing citizens to pay money for you to de-service them with less transportation options, worse gridlock, etc.\n11) removing Bloor/Danforth, Yonge & University bike lanes without proper process/consultation is unethical.\n12) removing bike lanes will make life worse for MANY Ontarians and increase gridlock by channeling both bikes and cars into the same lane on already\n13) Additional construction required to remove bike lanes will increase gridlock expodentially in the city! It will increase commute times for ALL with no long term benefits for anyone! The construction removal will take YEARS to do...\n14) car-first mentality is a very outdated way of thinking and planning! It has been shown to be ineffective and adding \"just one more car lane\" has never relieved traffic or decreased travel times.\n15) this legislation is not data-based or reflective of facts in any way - you would be voting to \"improve gridlock\" under false pretenses. Even the name of this legislation is misleading for the average person or MPP not paying attention! It won't save anyone time and will make gridlock worse all over Ontario!!!\n16) this goes against experts in the field of planning and transportation\n17) there are no viable \"side street\" options in Toronto to replace Bloor/Danforth, Yonge or University bike lanes! Those streets provide direct routes, otherwise cyclists will be going in circles or somewhere that's not useful to travel to... Would you tell car drivers to use side streets only when commuting to work, running errands, etc. Is it even possible for you to find a route to do this? If its not logical for a car route how can it be logical for cyclists?\n18) Under the assumption that you can even find side streets in Toronto (or elsewhere in Ontario!) to replace the main streets to our bike lanes on, how much longer would it make commute times for cyclists? I can guarantee you it would likely double their commute times... So why is a cyclists commute time not being factored into a legislation literally called \"Reducing Gridlock - Saving You Time Act\". Is the \"You\" specifically referring to Car Drivers exclusively? Why are they the only Ontarians whose time is important or worth improving over cyclists safety and time?\n19) Your Premier and Minister of Transportation are sneaking into this legislation a sideline of an essential environmental scan before they build a new highway. Do they already know it won't pass the environmental scan? Ask yourself why they don't want one done and why circumventing the environmental scan could impact Ontarians and their environment for decades and generations in the future. Don't you want to ensure things are done properly to ensure the longevity of Ontario's environment and conserve critical wildlife/environments? If its safe to do it should be documented and shown to Ontarians before it's built to prove so!\nThis is a short list! These are sooo many things wrong with this legislation.\nVOTE NO TO LEGISLATION 212. IT WONT HELP ANYONE, IT WILL INCREASE GRIDLOCK, KILL PEOPLE, DEVASTATE THE ENVIRONMENT IN THE LONG RUN, & INCREASE COMMUTING TIME ACROSS ONTARIO!\nMPPs STAND UP FOR ONTARIANS YOU'VE BEEN CHOSEN TO REPRESENT. THIS BILL DOESN'T MAKE SENSE! IT IS NOT WHAT PEOPLE WANT.\n"

As noted by the Annex BIA and in the research evidence on the subject, bike lanes contribute to economic development and have no or a negligible impact on commute times for motorists. Bike lanes are also safer for all involved, particularly road users on bikes. This government has lost its way with its obsession on meddling in municipal politics.
