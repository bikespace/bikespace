        "comment": "As a student living in Toronto and studying in Guelph, I use bike lanes every day for my commute both at home and at school and I would prefer more of them not less! When I do drive, I would prefer that bikes have their own lane so that the relatively lower speed of bike traffic doesn't impede higher speed cars. They are an essential part of infrastructure just like bridges, trains and sidewalks.\nRemoving bike lanes would only put people like me who rely on them at undue risk of injury by forcing us onto streets between cars. This is a fundamental restriction on my freedom of choice by mandating that anyone that rides a bike must endure a high level of risk to do so. If anything improvements should be made to existing bike infrastructure to further improve rider safety.\nThe government should not be adding red tape restricting local governments from building infrastructure where it would best help their residents. If the Government of Ontario truly wanted to reduce traffic they would improve transit options allowing constituents to avoid these congested roads. In proof of this, people have counted bikes and cars on Bloor Rd (see link) where, despite occupying less space, counts of bikes rival that of cars.\nIn summary, removing bike lanes harms bikers safety, reduces overall traffic flow by replacing highly space efficient bikes with low density cars, and impedes car traffic by forcing lower speed bikes to share the same lanes.\n"

First of all, this moves us in the opposite direction of promoting the use of bikes instead of automobiles and secondly, the bike lanes keep riders safe. As a mother of two both of whom live and work downtown, I feel safer knowing that my kids do not share the road with cars.\nAlso, as someone who drove into the office for many years, I know how nerve-wracking it is to navigate around bikes and how unsafe it is for the bikers themselves.\nDo not remove the bike lanes!\n"

        "comment": "I am opposed to bike lane removal and to the unnecessary obstruction of future bike lanes. This proposal assumes that bike lanes contribute to congestion when research suggests that bike lanes are beneficial to traffic. Encouraging bike use in the city by having safe bike lanes can help with not only conhestion but lowering emissions. The city has implemented bike lanes in specific areas after carefull consideration of their impact. Locale stores have also voiced their support for bike lanes in the area because of their possitive impact.\nPersonally, I am a student and I specifically use the Bloor and Younge bike lanes to get to school, not because it is the fastyor most direct route, but because the bike lanes make it is the safest route, especially at night.\n"

        "comment": "You're arguments for doing this are already based on a bias from a car driver perspective. If bike infrastructure was better more people will bike. If you make it worse, more people will drive and fill the new lanes. It has been proven and well established that adding lanes does not reduce congestion (e.g. Induced Demand). Please do some research before proposing wasting our money on this when those funds could be used on effective methods of reducing car usage, such as public transit and active transportation.\n"

        "comment": "There isn't one solution to traffic, there are many independent actions needed to be taken to ensure our cities and towns can move effectively. There have been countless studies done in Canada, the United states and many other nations such as the Netherlands and Japan which clearly show a correlation between the amount of and the quality of design for a particular mode of transportation and the amount of people who use it. If you don't invest in Public transportation or cycling networks or even pedestrian friendly designs you will never solve the issue of congestion. No amount of removing room from cyclists or any other mode of transport in favour of single occupancy vehicles will ever result in improved traffic flow in the long run. The bike lanes need to be invested in, not demolished in the hope it will help Toronto. If the issue is that not enough people use the lanes, question why. Perhaps the lanes cut off suddenly, forcing riders into heavy traffic. Perhaps they are unprotected from fast moving heavy vehicles which will park/block the lane if given the option. Toronto needs to reevaluate if it wants to keep the city moving, or to give the illusion of freedom and choice to those well off enough to afford an expensive vehicle. There are too many cars trying to force their way through the city, the plan should be to give as many people reliable alternatives to driving and to reduce how many cars are on the streets, leading to redistribution of land for productive uses, example being the many parking lots could then be used for housing, something we need right now. If congestion is such a problem, I fail to see how forcing the people who don't drive back into cars and on the road is going to help anything. Induced demand is a concept which has been around for decades and yet our politicians are still thinking in the past. Removing the bike lanes will not improve the traffic flow, just as building that tunnel under the 401 won't.\n"

        "comment": "The provincial government should not be interfering with municipalities that are trying to improve and increase transportation options for its residents. A disconnected, unmaintained bike network is one that will receive little traffic. The argument that few use the bike lanes is bunk--imagine if car traffic lanes did not connect to one another just as bike lanes do not; few people would drive if it was so inconvenient. For those who cannot drive (for reasons of pricing, disability, old age, stress, environmental impact concerns, or any number of other valid reasons), bike lanes are essential infrastructure just as much as sidewalks. Cyclists are tax payers just like motorists, and deserve to have a basic standard of safety assured when they leave their homes to commute. When I am driving, I would much prefer that cyclists are isolated and insulated by raised curbs and barriers from my path so I do not have to worry about another variable while driving in a hectic city. This does not mean that they cannot travel along the same routes; in fairness, all travellers, whether by foot, bike, or motor vehicle, should have the ability to travel along the most direct, convenient, and safe path to their destinations. Cyclists should not have to take lengthy detours avoiding the most direct east-west or north-south routes to their destinations like bloor-danforth, or yonge street. Imagine if cars had to constantly be altering their routes and turning around constantly. Now imagine if it was raining, cold, windy, or too hot, and you had to pedal the vehicle yourself while navigating deadly motorist traffic. It is small wonder these routes are not as frequented by cyclists as they are by motorists. Further, bike lanes provide easy funneling into the transit network, especially if one becomes too tired to continue pedalling or the weather become adverse. The TTC could definitely use more funding, while I am on the subject. \"If you build it, they will come,\" it is a saying that applies here. Keep adding car lanes and the traffic will only get worse. Invest in and improve the TTC and build bike lanes and you will see fewer cars on the road blocking your way when you need to get somewhere in a hurry.\n"

These provide safe ways for people to commute and travel around the city, and have proven benefits to the economy, the environment, and the physical well-being of Ontarians.\nIf this bill goes forward, it will mean putting cyclists of all ages at an increased risk for life-altering injuries and death. 6 cyclists have already died this year on the road, up from 1 in 2023. How many will die as a result of Bill 212? What's more, a portion of cyclists who are deterred from using their previously safe routes will turn to traveling by vehicles, further increasing the amount of vehicles on the roads, the city's congestion, and carbon emissions.\nInvest in better transit systems for a reduced number of cars on the road, rather than jeopardizing the lives of citizens.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is a terrible idea which will result in more red tape, more congestion, and reduced road safety. Cyclists deserve to use public roadways. Forcing them to intermix with cars will have negative outcomes in terms of cycling related deaths. It will also backfire and make congestion worse. Removing transportation options (unsafe road conditions will force people to consider other modes of transport) will force people to choose between other available options. In this case, it will result in more cars on the road, further worsening congestion.\nToronto is no longer a suburban WASP backwater; it is a burgeoning metropolis. Private vehicle transport does not scale to this tier of city. A quick look around the world will confirm this. If we want to look for examples of large, extremely car-dependant cities, we can look at Los Angeles, which is car-choked to the extreme, and in an even worse state than we are congestion-wise.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly disagree with the proposed Bill 212.\nThe addition of designated bike lanes in Toronto has been a wonderful change to the city. I've witnessed the flow of bike traffic on a bike lane during morning rush hour and was impressed with how many cyclists were making use of the lane for commuting. Consider all the cars that have been removed from the roads because these people chose to bike to work instead! This must make a significant positive impact on pollution and congestion in the city. And don't forget the health benefits to the people cycling.\nIn addition, granting the provincial government \"exemption from the Environmental Assessment Act\" is total nonsense.  The province is suggesting sweeping changes to tear out existing bike lanes without making any assessments on the benefits of the bike lanes.\nPersonally, when I can, I choose to cycle to get to nearby destinations for running errands and going to appointments. Often, for the places I'm going, cycling is as fast as driving, and faster than transit. Removing the bike lanes would make the roads more dangerous for cyclists and would cause more congestion when those who deem the roads too dangerous for cycling, opt for driving.\nTransportation in the province should not be prioritizing cars and driving. There should be more focus on less polluting options and improving public transit. Instead of wasting time and resources on removing bike lanes, why doesn't the provincial government and Ministry of Transportation focus on opening the VERY long delayed Metrolinx transit lines in Toronto, like the Eglinton Crosstown?\n"

Removing bike lanes from these streets will actually reduce the number of people who are able to frequent the businesses. Sending the bike traffic down secondary streets is not a solution, because the secondary streets do not contain the destinations people want to visit.\n"
