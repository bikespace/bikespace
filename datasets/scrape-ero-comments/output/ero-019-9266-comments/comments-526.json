He is obviously only thinking of the weath he can enjoy now and not the air quality future generations will have, including his grandchildren.\nMoney was spent on bike lanes and now money will be spent removing them so that we can have even more car gridlock in the city.\nMore and more climate change denial and people's hard earned money spent doing and undoing.\n8 billion will be spent on the high way and guess what, the next government will reverse the decision.  So why not avoid wasting money and just stop now with these destructive plans?  The greenbelt is there for a reason.\nCanada is truly embarassing with it's poor transit infrastructure.  How lazy, incompetent and corrupt can a government be when they can't build an efficent transportation system.\nI would rather read a nice book on the train than stress about being late while stuck in traffic.\nCanada is becoming a more and more backwards country with out of date technology and development.\nPlease do better and take ideas from more advanced countries that care about the environment their people live in.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are absolutely vital infrastructure from a health, environment, and equality perspective.\nMy family and I use the Bloor bike lanes almost daily. They provide a safe way for my husband and I to transport our toddlers short to medium distances.\nTraffic is so dangerous for cyclists that we would not take this risk without dedicated bike lanes. If they are taken away, we will be forced to drive everywhere with our kids, exacerbating congestion.\nOverwhelming evidence shows bike lanes to not worsen congestion.\nMy own experience driving on Bloor (with bike lanes) versus Dupont (without) is no time saving at all because people veer back and forth across the 2 lanes so much trying to avoid getting stuck behind left and right turners, ultimately causing more back up. Alternately Bloor with one main lane and then dedicated right or left turn lanes in high traffic areas is much more civilized and predictable.\nI urge the Ontario government to follow the evidence on congestion, and keep the bike lanes as they are. Not to mention the environmental, health, and income equality benefits. Finally, for the safety of my children and other Toronto families we need those bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "Hi there - I do not support the removal of bike lanes in toronto, and I live, drive and bike downtown. Removing the bike lanes will have a large cost, will cause disruption due to construction and will not magically solve gridlock in the city. The best estimate I\u2019ve read is that their removal might reduce trips downtown by 8 minutes for cars. But this isn\u2019t a panacea and it won\u2019t solve the real problem. We need to keep up building transit at the rate we currently are. This government is already doing exactly what we need, through the Eglinton and finch LRTs the downtown relief line, the go smart track program and the electrification of the existing Go lines. I wish there was a magic fix to congestion in this city, but there isn\u2019t. We need to spend decades doing exactly what you are already doing. And removing bike lanes, at enormous cost and disruption is just a distraction with no benefits at all.\n"

This pride had come from the cities gradual adoption of quality urban development infrastructure. The Danforth went from a dangerous and inefficient road to a thriving hub for local commerce and safe sustainable transportation.\nWith extensive experience in hospitality management including being employed by businesses along Yonge and University. I've seen first hand how important these bike lanes are to local hospitality commerce. Both for the safety of the couriers and for the financial well-being of the hospitality and tourism industry.\nProtected bike lanes are an absolutely essential part of the modernization efforts in the city of Toronto. To abandon them in their infancy is worse than shortsighted. It is a waste of taxpayer money that puts the health and well being of Canadian citizens at risk. It is harmful to the hospitality and tourism industry in Toronto.\nThis bill will hold Toronto back on the world stage.\n"

        "comment": "I moved to Toronto 8 years ago from Barcelona, Spain. Initially, I was shocked and appalled at the lack of protected cycling infrastructure in Toronto. I had become so used to protected cycling infrastructure, that I never thought twice about using Barcelona's public bike share (Bicing). Bike share is a normal default mode of transport for thousands and thousands of people there. Everyone I knew owned and used (to some degree) a bike share card. It was the perfect compliment to their bus / metro system and really eliminated the need for a car.\nAfter arriving in Toronto I bought a bike, but, I found myself becoming very hesitant to use it. I felt like every time I got on the bike, I was dancing with death, the little cycling infrastructure I had close to me didn't take me anywhere near the majority of places I needed to go. The result, I got in a car and drove almost everywhere. I eventually gave the bike away. The inaccessibility of safe cycling infrastructure is a major reason as to why Toronto's streets are so congested. Cycling is not seen as a normal activity to many residents of this city because it has historically not been safe and accessible. To see that Toronto had begun modernising by adding and connecting protected bike lanes gave me hope that this city was following the lead of the majority of other modern congested major cities.\nDuring covid lockdowns I bought a new bike and made an effort to once again normalize cycling to myself. I now ride my bike 3.5km to work 5 days a week, 11 months of the year. There is no cycling infrastructure to take me to work. Sadly, there is not a month that goes by where I don't have close calls with impatient / distracted / entitled motorists, they are normally a weekly occurrence, but somehow the financial, as well as mental / physical health, benefits of cycling seem better than driving / taking the bus. Protected cycling infrastructure saves lives, it encourages people to get out of cars and use other forms of transport.\nI have worked as a postal worker (yes, driving a van) all over downtown & the west end of Toronto for the last 4 years. Driving and delivering in areas with separated cycling lanes has caused me, at most, a minimal inconvenience. Removing bike lanes which not only save lives (hello vision zero!), but also encourage people to get out of cars seems absolutely criminal, not to mention such a monumental waste of money. I currently deliver around Bloor and Christie Pits, if that lane is removed many people will stop cycling, some will be injured by cars and a small number will probably be killed. An extra car lane is going to do nothing to solve congestion, getting people out of cars and providing them with safe alternatives on the other hand, just might!\nI do not consider myself a 'cyclist'. I am a human who uses cars, bikes, buses, trains and vans for transport.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is absolutely ridiculous. As someone who bikes to work in Toronto virtually every day, I value bike lanes because they ensure my commute is safe. Biking is the fastest way to get across the city -- faster than driving or transit.\nDoea the government not realize that if all the cyclists jumped into their cars to drive to work each day, traffic would be astronomically worse?\nFinally, I want to highlight that there are no bike lanes on the Gardiner or the DVP or Dufferin Street or so many other roads where traffic is currently a nightmare.\nThis bill is highly flawed and outright dangerous for anyone who bikes through the city.\n"

The reason I don\u2019t currently bike everywhere is because I simply don\u2019t trust other drivers with my safety in an unprotected bike lane.\nIf we had more protected bike lanes that enabled me to get to the places I need to go without driving, you would get at least one car (mine) off the road, and I know I\u2019m not alone in feeling this way.\nReconsider your stance on this. You have an opportunity to make a huge difference in congestion levels by adding more protected bike lanes, not by limiting them.\n"

        "comment": "Can anyone in government explain how removing bike infrastructure actually helps improve the flow of traffic?\nWe should add more bike lanes and safe infrastructure, connecting all major streets instead of having interruptions.\nBikes take up less space than cars, so removing safe options for cyclists to move around the city will create more car traffic by adding more drivers into the bottlenecks.\nA real solution would look like removing street parking, where one illegally parked car can reduce a two lane street to one lane.\nA 13 year old girl in Ajax was just struck by a SUV and killed, at a crosswalk. And this bill supports removing infrastructure put in place to save lives.\nIt's embarrassing how Toronto touts itself as a major city but is so far behind on alternative methods of transportation than cars.\nNot to mention how tearing up already built infrastructure is a waste of our tax dollars. The construction will also cause major traffic congestion.\n"

People want to cycle and absolutely need more non-car transportation options. Unfortunately we need to implement the infrastructure first before seeing activity, already making it difficult to convince people that we deserve cities with quality non-car transportation options.\nI do not support Bill 212. Denying municipalities the ability to install new bike lanes without provincial approval will severely limit municipalities\u2019 ability to protect all road users, fight climate change, and ease congestion. It will just make any progress much more difficult.\nPlaces like Burlington need the power to implement the transportation plans they have developed without provincial red tape.\n"

        "comment": "Cyclists are pedestrians are on the road and have been protected with implemented bike lane infrastructure (especially hard infrastructure), similarly to how pedestrians are protected on sidewalks (i.e., hard infrastructure) from driving cars.\nI am someone who has LEARNED to commute by biking on the streets BECAUSE of the existence of bike lanes and BECAUSE I feel safe ON BIKE LANES. I am also someone who does drive from time to time, but often opt to bike because because of car traffic, the environment, and because SAFE BIKE LANES EXIST. Though, from a driver's point of view (my own driving point of view), car traffic seems inevitably caused by the number of drivers, not that lack of driving lanes. Car traffic and gridlock exists on the Gardiner and the DVP, yet there are no bike lanes there.\nThis proposal is misinformed and misguided (not evidence based) - removing bike lanes from the main downtown lanes will not solve car traffic, but perhaps implementing more bike lanes will encourage people to bike more than drive. The proposal to remove bike lanes to alleviate car traffic is not representative of Torontonians and Toronto's huge cycling community (which is the everyday person). Making Toronto a more car-centric city will a) cause more traffic and b) cause more deaths from drivers killing cyclers. Also, promoting more drivers in the city is a) adding more CO2 emissions to an existing and alarming climate crisis (REMINDER: Toronto did become flooded twice this summer) and b) is excluding accessible modes of transportation to ALL demographics (youth, adults, and seniors - since you do not need a license to bike!). Removing bike lanes will make Toronto a non-inclusive City, since cars are not an accessible mode of transportation - not everyone drives or knows how to drive, nor does everyone own a car. And, provided that there are UNMANAGED HIGH LIVING COSTS, cycling and bike lane infrastructure to support cycling MUST CONTINUE TO BE SUPPORTED as a primary mode of transportation. Again, CYCLISTS ARE PEDESTRIANS ON THE ROAD.\nThis argument to remove bike lanes for cars can be equated to removing sidewalks dedicated to pedestrians - it is a non-sensical. Drivers are not educated to share the rode with cyclists and often cyclists are put in danger when drivers are entitled to take up the biking lane - i.e., SPACE that HAS been designated to cyclists.\nRemoving bike lanes will cause more serious life-long injuries and deaths. I have known people to be concussed from getting doored by cars (while still wearing a helmet). And, just a reminder: cyclists died this year due to unsafe roads and unsafe drivers. Bike lanes are for people who seek an accessible mode of transportation and just want to get home safe.\nAs a cyclist, I do not want to get run over by a car on Yonge St., Bloor St. and University Ave. As a driver, I do not want to run over a cyclist - I would much rather cyclists have their own lanes. Safe streets save lives.\nAlso, the Province should NOT be deciding anything for the City of Toronto - and millions of dollars have been put into bike lane infrastructure already. We don't want Doug Ford making decisions for the City of Toronto - the Provincial Government is already contributing to a boiling hot climate as it is.\n"
