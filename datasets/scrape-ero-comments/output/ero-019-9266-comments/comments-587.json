I feel this bill endangers my and other peoples safety who choose a method of transportation that does not use electricity or fossil fuel. I feel my human right to safety is being trampled by a govt. who sees only the car as a viable form of transport.\nAlso bundling this bill to trample any pushback on yet another highway that you may just decide to sell as another toll road. There is a perfectly viable under used highway doing a very similar route but it was sold by another conservative govt. take back the 407 and any need to build another highway is gone.\nBuilding more and more roads removing lanes for alternate types of transportation and not investing real money in public transport adds to global warming and limits Ontarian's ability to function without yet another car.\n"

        "comment": "I totally disagree with Ford's intervention on bike lanes.  Bike lanes are a critical way for us to move forward and have BETTER movement of people through the city.  Without bike lanes, cyclists are at risk of injury and death.   We are regressing when we undo the progress made to enable the use of bicycles to get around the city.  RideShare programs are fantastic but without bike lanes they become so dangerous.  People's lives are at stake.\nBike lanes ensure a separation between traffic and bicycles -- if the lanes are removed then traffic will have to slow for unpredictable bicycle riding.\nWe need to follow the leadership of other countries where lanes have been used to get people SAFELY onto their bikes resulting in fewer vehicles on the streets.\nIn addition, if Ford is allowed to intervene on this issue then where does he stop?   Ford would never allow the federal government to move into provincial space so why does he think he can move into city space?\n"

Not with this government.\nDo not pass this legislation!\nWe also don\u2019t need another highway going through Toronto.

As a driver, I also feel safer and don\u2019t worry as much about killing anybody on their bike. I am disgusted in the lack of thought for the safety of all road users, including cyclists. I am not a single-issuer voter, but if I was, this would be it.\nDon\u2019t rip out infrastructure. Have a vision. We want Toronto to be world-class city. This isn\u2019t it.\n"

        "comment": "The removal of existing bicycle lanes on Bloor Street, University Avenue and Yonge Street is *not* common sense. Responsible management of the finances of the Province of Ontario would dictate that spending taxpayer dollars to removal these lanes is inappropriate at best. The removal will *not* improve traffic flow (most of the traffic flow is better now than pre-bicycle lanes). The 1-metre distance rule from bicycles on roadways (barely enforced on cars and trucks) will make bicycle lane removal problematic. Increased car and truck traffic will add more pollution, increase the likelihood of injury and death (especially to pedestrians and bicyclists). Fewer people would likely bicycle in these streets, resulting in more unhealthy (obsese, etc.) individuals costing more healthcare dollars. The government is on notice and setting itself up for future lawsuits when injuries/deaths occur. The primary contributors to traffic issues are construction (road and building) and a lack of transit options. How about enforcing the license plate plastic covers - they are illegal so start pulling people over for having them. And stop these ads about Ontario on television - you are wasting taxpayers' money. Also, emergency vehicles can be smaller - examine the European experience. Be smarter folks!\n"

        "comment": "It seems ridiculous to have to reiterate this in 2024; Bike Lanes are essential transportation infrastructure for a major city like Toronto, and protect the safety of citizens who choose to use a bicycle to commute to their end destination. Riding a bicycle has low environmental impact, a positive impact on health, and, is often the quickest way to travel from point A to B in Toronto. There are countless pieces of evidence to support this, from studies, to looking at the infrastructure of great European cities, to simply looking at the number of cyclists quickly travelling to work in a bike lane at 8:30AM on a weekday.\nPremier Doug Ford\u2019s Bill 212 is an ill-informed assault on the free choice of Toronto citizens to safely bike to where they need to go. Ill informed as it pushes a car-centric ideology and rural point of view onto people who operate in Canada\u2019s largest city, where the car is usually not the best option for transportation. Assault because would literally endanger the people who choose to bike if it were to be put in place, we need not look any further than the amount of cyclist deaths in the city in recent years \u2013 an example is Bloor Street, which is a proposed bike lane removal project, and a street that already has had a number of cyclist deaths.\nMy final comment is that it is a waste of money and time to rip up already established bicycle infrastructure \u2013 years of time and millions of tax dollars would be spent to destroy already thriving bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "The proposal of bill 212 to restrict bike lanes on major roads will make cycling less safe and less popular.   Cycling helps reduce the need for road infrastructure.  Cycling encourages people to adopt healthier lifestyles. Forcing cyclists to use secondary roads will discourage cycling as the routes will be longer and less efficient.\n"

        "comment": "I live at Yonge and college and regularly use these bike paths. I can confidently say, I have felt much safer riding down university to work than any other street. I have nearly gotten into many accidents on roads where there is no designated bike paths. There are not many paths for me to take to work and this would be a huge hindrance. I also regularly take the Bloor Street bike path. I understand that secondary streets can be a better solution for bike paths but currently downtown Toronto does not have these routes in place. Getting rid of existing Infrastructure basically removes the only infrastructure that is for someone like me who commutes by bike.\n"

        "comment": "Cities requiring approval from the province to make changes to their transportation infrastructure is ridiculous. Adding hoops to jump through slows the process of making cycling safe and accessible for all. Toronto is still growing massively, if every person who lived in the city and moved into every new development were forced to drive a car, nobody would be getting anywhere. Making cycling a viable alternative to driving is a must if you truly want to reduce gridlock.\nOn top of that with the cost of living going up, car ownership is becoming impossible for more and more people. I'd love to see the TTC be a decent alternative but prices have gone up, reliability isn't anywhere near where it should be, expansions are years away (looking at you Eglington), and there are maniacs walking up and down the trains every day. Cycling can fill this void for people who want a safe, reliable, and cheap way to get to where they want to be. Don't get in the way of that.\n"

I also feel more confident that I will not be receiving a call from the police saying she\u2019s been killed by a distracted driver during the busiest traffic times of the day due to the segregated lanes available along her commute.\nThe loss of these bike lanes will force her to drive to work costing us $25 p/day and adding another single occupant vehicle to the already gridlocked peak hour traffic.\nAdditionally, my wife and I predominantly use bicycles to travel around the city of Toronto now due to parking, traffic, construction, cost & convenience. This change in our lifestyle, for the better we believe, has been made possible by the slow growth of cycling lane infrastructure in Toronto in the past 10 years. Along with many others, I\u2019m sure, the loss of these lanes will greatly impact our lives negatively.\n"

        "comment": "The provincial government should not be add red tape to local governments and restricting their ability to make meaningful changes to the lives withing their area.\nAs someone who uses bike lines almost every day, I cannot stress how integral to my mobility. They are a key piece of infrastructure that allows me to choose how I would like to traverse the city that I live in.\nSeparation makes everyone safer and should be one of the primary concerns. The number of cyclist related injuries and deaths is frightening and removing infrastructure will only make this issue worse. As I driver I also would rather that cyclists not be sharing the road. It slows down traffic and causes a dangerous situation, drivers often do not respect passing cyclists.\nBicycle infrastructure is only a part of the solution and removing it would be massively detrimental to the transit system as a whole. It allows people to get to transit stations and hubs leading to a more friendly transit ecosystem and overall usage.\nRemoving of existing bike lanes will not only be expensive and time consuming but a massive waste of funding and expertise when there are numerous other issues that the province should be focused on.\n"

        "comment": "Removing existing or blocking well-thought out planned bike lanes will do nothing to reduce congestion, it will cost lives, waste taxpayers'\u00a0money, dissuade people from considering alternatives to driving, hurt local businesses, and undermine local democracy.\u00a0Nothing about this makes sense, and the government knows it. The city of Toronto has studied the impact of bike lanes pretty much each time it added them and consistently found that impact on car traffic was negligible. They also consistently\u00a0found that it is good for business and for the safety of all road users. In fact, I drive regularly in\u00a0the\u00a0city and I love the bike lanes. They reduce\u00a0possible points of conflict significantly and make driving more pleasant as a result.\u00a0Either the government knows all this and is doing it regardless, which makes it nothing but an attempt to score cheap political points at the expense of people's lives, or it did not do its basic due diligence, which suggests incompetence.\nThe idea of moving bike lanes to side roads also is absurd. Bike riders too have to be in the same places as drivers, the same businesses, schools, jobs, recreation centres, etc. Those are overwhelmingly on main roads. Moving bike lanes to side roads only makes sense if you assume that cyclists only bike for recreation. Moreover, the City of Toronto's staff report to the November 2024 Council made it clear that for most major bike routes, there's no viable alternatives on side roads.\nHalf of downtown Toronto residents don't own a car, and about thirty percent of all of the city. And, far from the 1% that the government cites, the City's own surveys show that more than 40% of Torontonians cycle regularly, and that's up to 70% when including recreational use.\u00a0The message that this measure sends to such a large proportion of the city is that they don't count and their safety doesn't count. After all, bike lanes have proven to be beneficial to pedestrian safety as well,\u00a0as\u00a0they\u00a0significantly reduced accidents involving all road\u00a0users.\u00a0The province is willing to sacrifice the safety of Torontonians for marginal improvements in travel times at best, or likely even no real improvements.\nIn a time of climate emergency, we should be encouraging people to bike, walk, use transit, this does the opposite and doesn't even have a trade off.\u00a0The safety of children biking to school or their friends -- and of others,\u00a0of course -- shouldn't be made into a battle in a culture war.\n"

The body of research evidence demonstrates that bike lanes reduce, not increase, traffic (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijtst.2024.06.002). They additionally have a traffic calming effect.\nI would be supportive of further bike lanes not being built on city traffic arteries such as Yonge st, University ave, and Bloor street, if better alternatives are constructed. City cycling/pedestrian paths without cars are preferred by both cyclists and motorists, as they are safer, prevent cyclist-motorist interaction and more scenic.\nI ask the provincial government to consider the negative impact of further construction to remove bike lanes and also to remember that cyclists come from all political backgrounds. Bikes and bike lanes need not be a partisan issue.\n"
