My child's safety. all for what? every single expert on traffic control disagrees with this ridiculous and short sighted move. removing bike lanes won't reduce gridlock. Less cars is the solution. If all those cyclists start driving because its no longer safe to bike to work, what then? If anything, you're adding more cars to the gridlock.\nDoug Ford, you are not the mayor of Toronto. Stay in your lane and focus on the things you should be controlling, like the Eglinton line or our crumbling healthcare system. Thanks\n"

        "comment": "Hi, so removing bike lanes for vehicle lanes actually slows down motor vehicle traffic, the infrastructure for easily accessible transportation is already in a sorry state nation wide but the easier you make it for people to travel without a car, the more people will travel without a car. Since whoever came up with the idea to remove these bike lanes probably isn\u2019t thinking at even an elementary level, less drivers means less cars on the road which means less, therefore faster, traffic. Not to mention a good portion of the population can\u2019t even drive such as children and anyone who can\u2019t obtain a license, parents could spend less time clogging the streets at the beginning and end of school days if their children are able to safely commute to school.\n"

        "comment": "I am a vulnerable road user and I deserve to get home safely. My life has value, I have value. As Doug Ford refuses to use facts to support his bills, I'm going to do you all a favour and give you the facts below.\nInduced demand is a concept in transportation planning and economics that refers to the phenomenon where increasing the supply of a good or service\u2014in this case, adding more car lanes\u2014leads to an increase in the demand for that good or service. In the context of transportation, specifically roadways, induced demand is when additional lanes are added to a road or highway, it initially reduces congestion and makes travel more convenient. However, this improvement in conditions often attracts more drivers, either those who previously avoided the route due to congestion or new drivers who change their travel patterns as a result of the improved conditions.\nOver time, the increased number of vehicles can lead to a return of congestion levels similar to or EVEN WORSE than before the additional lanes were added. This happens because the initial ease of travel encourages more people to use their cars, take longer trips, or travel during peak times, ultimately filling up the newly added capacity.\nKey points about induced demand in relation to adding more car lanes include:\n1. **Short-Term Relief**: Initially, adding more lanes can reduce congestion and improve traffic flow.\n2. **Increased Vehicle Usage**: The improved conditions can lead to more people choosing to drive, taking longer trips, or traveling during peak hours.\n3. **Return of Congestion**: Over time, the increase in vehicle usage can lead to congestion levels rising back to or exceeding the levels before the lanes were added.\n4. **Urban Sprawl**: Additional lanes can encourage urban sprawl by making it easier for people to live farther from their workplaces and other destinations, leading to more driving and further congestion.\n5. **Environmental Impact**: Increased vehicle usage can lead to higher emissions and greater environmental impact.\nThe concept of induced demand highlights the challenges in using road expansion as a long-term solution to traffic congestion and underscores the importance of considering alternative solutions such as public transportation improvements, BIKE LANES, demand management strategies, and smart growth policies.\nBike lanes offer numerous benefits across various aspects of society, including the environment, the economy, and public health. Here\u2019s how they contribute positively in each area:\n### Environmental Benefits\n1. **Reduced Emissions**: Bicycles produce zero emissions, unlike cars which contribute to greenhouse gases and air pollution. More people biking translates to fewer cars on the road and thus lower emissions.\n2. **Lower Carbon Footprint**: Cycling is a sustainable mode of transportation with a significantly lower carbon footprint compared to motor vehicles.\n3. **Reduced Noise Pollution**: Bicycles are much quieter than motor vehicles, contributing to less noise pollution in urban areas.\n4. **Less Traffic Congestion**: Bike lanes encourage more people to cycle, reducing the number of cars on the road and thereby reducing traffic congestion and idling emissions.\n### Economic Benefits\n1. **Reduced Transportation Costs**: Biking is a cost-effective mode of transportation. It eliminates fuel costs, parking fees, and many maintenance expenses associated with cars.\n2. **Boosts Local Businesses**: Cyclists are more likely to stop at local businesses along their route compared to drivers. This can increase spending at local shops, cafes, and restaurants.\n3. **Lower Infrastructure Costs**: Bike lanes are generally cheaper to construct and maintain than roadways for motor vehicles. This can lead to significant savings for municipalities.\n4. **Health Cost Savings**: Increased physical activity from biking can reduce healthcare costs associated with sedentary lifestyles and related diseases.\n### Health Benefits\n1. **Improved Physical Fitness**: Cycling is an excellent form of exercise that improves cardiovascular health, muscle strength, and overall physical fitness.\n2. **Reduced Risk of Chronic Diseases**: Regular physical activity, such as biking, can lower the risk of chronic diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and obesity.\n3. **Mental Health Benefits**: Physical activity has been shown to reduce stress, anxiety, and depression. Cycling can also improve mood and mental well-being.\n4. **Safer Streets**: Dedicated bike lanes separate cyclists from motor traffic, reducing the risk of accidents and injuries. This makes cycling a safer option for more people.\n### Additional Benefits\n1. **Increased Mobility**: Bike lanes provide an additional mode of transportation, making cities more accessible to people who do not own cars, including low-income individuals, teenagers, and those who prefer not to drive.\n2. **Community Building**: Cycling infrastructure can encourage a sense of community by promoting social interactions among cyclists.\n3. **Efficient Use of Space**: Bikes take up much less space than cars, both on the road and when parked, leading to more efficient use of urban space.\nIn summary, bike lanes are a multifaceted solution that not only address environmental concerns but also enhance economic vitality and improve public health. They contribute to making cities more livable, sustainable, and equitable.\nIf we don\u2019t have safe bike lane infrastructure, more people will be forced to drive. If every person in Ontario over the age of 16 had their own personal vehicle and drove it instead of cycling, walking, or using public transit, several significant impacts would likely arise across various dimensions, including environmental, economic, social, and infrastructural aspects. Here are some potential outcomes:\n### Environmental Impacts\n1. **Increased Emissions**: A significant rise in the number of vehicles would lead to higher greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to climate change and air pollution.\n2. **Air Quality Deterioration**: More vehicles on the road would increase the levels of pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM), worsening air quality and potentially leading to health issues like respiratory problems and heart disease.\n3. **Noise Pollution**: An increase in vehicle traffic would result in higher levels of noise pollution, affecting the quality of life in urban and suburban areas.\n### Economic Impacts\n1. **Higher Transportation Costs**: Individuals would face increased costs associated with owning and maintaining a vehicle, including fuel, insurance, maintenance, and parking fees.\n2. **Infrastructure Strain**: The government would need to invest heavily in expanding and maintaining road infrastructure to accommodate the increased number of vehicles, potentially diverting funds from other critical areas such as education and healthcare.\n3. **Increased Health Costs**: With reduced physical activity due to less walking and cycling, there could be a rise in healthcare costs associated with treating chronic diseases related to sedentary lifestyles.\n### Social and Health Impacts\n1. **Reduced Physical Activity**: With fewer people walking or cycling, there would be a decline in physical activity levels, leading to higher rates of obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and other health issues.\n2. **Mental Health Effects**: Increased traffic congestion and longer commuting times could lead to higher stress levels and negatively impact mental health.\n3. **Social Isolation**: Reliance on personal vehicles might reduce opportunities for social interactions that often occur on public transit or while walking and cycling.\n### Infrastructural and Urban Planning Impacts\n1. **Traffic Congestion**: Roads would become heavily congested, especially during peak hours, leading to longer commute times and increased frustration among drivers.\n2. **Parking Challenges**: Finding parking spaces would become more difficult and expensive, especially in urban areas. There would be a need for more parking infrastructure, which could take up valuable urban space.\n3. **Urban Sprawl**: Increased reliance on personal vehicles could encourage urban sprawl, as people might choose to live farther from their workplaces and other amenities. This could lead to the loss of green spaces and agricultural land, and increased costs for providing public services to sprawling areas.\n### Public Transit and Cycling Infrastructure\n1. **Decline in Public Transit Use**: Public transit systems might see a significant drop in ridership, leading to reduced revenue and potential cuts to services. This could disproportionately affect those who rely on public transit, including low-income individuals and those who cannot drive.\n2. **Underutilization of Cycling Infrastructure**: Investments in cycling infrastructure might become underutilized, leading to a potential reallocation of funds away from sustainable transportation options.\n### Overall Impact on Quality of Life\n1. **Decreased Quality of Life**: The combined effects of increased traffic congestion, pollution, and reduced physical activity could lead to a lower overall quality of life.\n2. **Environmental Degradation**: The natural environment could suffer due to increased pollution and urban sprawl, affecting biodiversity and ecosystems.\nIn summary, if every person in Ontario over the age of 16 had their own personal vehicle and drove it instead of using more sustainable transportation modes, it would likely lead to significant negative impacts on the environment, economy, public health, and overall quality of life. It underscores the importance of promoting and investing in sustainable transportation options like public transit, cycling, and walking.\nThe introduction of bike lanes in Toronto has had several positive impacts on local businesses, contributing to improved economic activity and community vitality. Here are some ways business has improved after bike lanes have been introduced in Toronto:\n### Increased Foot Traffic\n1. **More Visitors**: Bike lanes make it easier and safer for cyclists to access various parts of the city, leading to increased foot traffic in business areas. Cyclists are more likely to stop at local shops, cafes, and restaurants.\n2. **Improved Accessibility**: Bike lanes improve accessibility to businesses for people who do not drive, including younger and older adults, and those who prefer not to own a car.\n### Higher Spending\n1. **Frequent Stops**: Studies have shown that cyclists tend to make more frequent stops compared to drivers. This can lead to increased spending at local businesses as cyclists are more likely to shop at multiple locations during their trips.\n2. **Local Patronage**: Cyclists often prefer to shop locally, as biking is more convenient for shorter trips. This boosts revenue for neighborhood businesses.\n### Enhanced Community Appeal\n1. **Attractive Streetscapes**: Bike lanes contribute to a more attractive and vibrant streetscape, making areas more appealing to visitors and residents. This can enhance the overall shopping and dining experience.\n2. **Community Well-being**: The presence of bike lanes can promote a sense of community and well-being, encouraging people to spend more time in local areas and supporting local businesses.\n### Economic Revitalization\n1. **Business Growth**: In some areas, the introduction of bike lanes has been associated with an increase in new business openings and a reduction in business vacancies. This can contribute to the economic revitalization of neighborhoods.\n2. **Property Values**: Improved infrastructure, including bike lanes, can lead to increased property values, benefiting both commercial and residential property owners.\n### Case Studies and Examples\n1. **Bloor Street**: One notable example is the Bloor Street bike lane pilot project. A study by the City of Toronto found that the installation of bike lanes on Bloor Street resulted in a 4.45% increase in customer spending and a 49% increase in the number of customers who visited the area by bike. Businesses along Bloor Street reported seeing new customers who might not have visited the area without the bike lanes.\n2. **Danforth Avenue**: The installation of bike lanes on Danforth Avenue also showed positive impacts, with local businesses reporting increased foot traffic and customer spending. The bike lanes made the area more attractive to both residents and visitors.\n### Reduced Transportation Costs\n1. **Employee Benefits**: Businesses can benefit from bike lanes as they provide employees with a cost-effective and healthy commuting option. Reduced transportation costs can lead to higher disposable income, which can be spent at local businesses.\n2. **Delivery and Logistics**: Some businesses have adopted cargo bikes for local deliveries, which can be more efficient and cost-effective in urban areas with bike lanes.\n### Health and Environmental Benefits\n1. **Healthier Customers**: Healthier lifestyles promoted by biking can lead to healthier customers who are more likely to engage in community activities and support local businesses.\n2. **Environmental Appeal**: Businesses that support sustainable transportation options like biking can attract environmentally conscious customers who prefer to support green initiatives.\n### Conclusion\nOverall, the introduction of bike lanes in Toronto has had a positive impact on local businesses by increasing accessibility, foot traffic, and spending, while also enhancing the community appeal and contributing to economic revitalization. These benefits highlight the importance of continuing to invest in cycling infrastructure as a means of supporting local economies and creating vibrant, sustainable urban environments.\n"

Bill 212's push to limit and potentially remove bike lanes is deeply concerning. Toronto's bike lanes aren't just lines on the road; they're lifelines that reduce car traffic, improve air quality, and create safe, sustainable travel options. The only real way to reduce car congestion is to encourage fewer people to drive, and accessible bike lanes are key to achieving that. Removing these lanes would make it more dangerous and discouraging for cyclists like us and ultimately lead to more cars clogging the streets.\n"

I do not support the removal of bike lanes on Bloor, University or Yonge street. It is a waste of my taxpayer dollars to remove these lanes, which have incurred millions of dollars to install. Also the university Ave lanes beautify the cityscape.

        "comment": "Disappointed at this plan. It does not serve the needs of the people who use these roads most - those that live by them - people like me and my daughter. Because of the bike lanes on Bloor, we are able to bike to her activities, try e movies, and her friends house. We chose to bike instead of drive. Eliminating these lanes will add our car to the road and prevent my daughter from getting needed exercise. It\u2019s simply not safe for children to bike in the city without them. This bill actively hurts the health of children in Toronto and prevent them riding bikes safely.\nIn addition, this bill does not have the appropriate research to back claims made that the bike lanes are causing delays. Construction is far more disruptive. On university avenue, no driving lanes have been affected by installing safe bike lanes. They are only blocked by construction. I insist that proper research be completed to fully understand the cost and impacts of any bike lane removal. This is vital infrastructure that should not be removed in a personal opinion. Let\u2019s take our uptime to evaluate and understand and make smart informed choices.\nOur want city streets are not highways. They are to serve community, not commuting.\n"

        "comment": "I fear that this will not provide any notable benefit unto its intended goal of reducing gridlock and rather will impact safety and mobility of those who rely on alternative modes of transportation. With the continually growing population density, gridlock is unlikely to be improved by replacing one mode of mobility with another. Additionally, without provision for alternatives, many existing bike lane users, forced to use these roads will now find themselves in much greater peril, while still causing the congestion this was intended to solve. The province should instead focus on bolstering all modes of transportation, not championing one over all. Ultimately the goal of transportation is to move people from point to point, so by providing multiple effective, safe, and reliable options (including cars) the transportation of citizens can be spread into as many pathways as possible to ensure we all get where we need to go.\n"

        "comment": "The stated objective of this Act is to reduce \"gridlock,\" yet it proposes measures likely to harm public health and safety, limit mobility and access to Ontario communities, damage environmental protections, and exacerbate the climate crisis.\nAlthough the Municipal Act grants municipalities authority over local affairs, this Act requires provincial approval for new bike lanes if they replace a traffic lane. This requirement represents an overreach by the provincial government, undermining local autonomy. It implies a lack of trust in municipalities to manage their own affairs and disregard for local democracy. Bike lanes are built only after an extensive planning process, including research and community engagement, so this intervention appears unnecessary and intrusive.\nAdditionally, adding car lanes has been proven ineffective for reducing traffic congestion. The principle of Induced Demand demonstrates that increasing road capacity only attracts more cars, worsening traffic over time. If the government were truly focused on easing gridlock, it would prioritize substantial investments in public transit infrastructure and develop extensive cycling networks. Cycling reduces road congestion, as each bike replaces a car, making more room for necessary vehicle use.\nPremier Ford\u2019s pledge to remove three bike lanes in Toronto disregards the thousands of people using these lanes daily, effectively taking thousands of cars off the road. Studies, such as the Bloor Bike Lane reports by Toronto city staff, show that bike lanes support local businesses, which are likely to suffer from their removal. Numerous Toronto Business Improvement Areas (BIAs) have already voiced their support for bike lanes, recognizing their value for local commerce.\nCycling is also a healthier choice, promoting better health outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. The presence of bike lanes makes streets safer for all users\u2014cyclists, drivers, and pedestrians alike. This year alone, six cyclists have died on Toronto streets, a tragic reminder of the need for safer cycling infrastructure.\nFurthermore, bike lanes expand mobility options for those who cannot afford car ownership, enabling more residents to travel for work, leisure, and commerce, supporting a more inclusive local economy. A car-centric approach, on the other hand, marginalizes people without access to a private vehicle.\nRegarding the exemption of Highway 413 lands from environmental assessments, this policy is shortsighted and environmentally damaging. The proposed highway route passes through sensitive land that serves as a carbon sink, habitat for native species, and natural floodplain. Paving over this area would permanently degrade its environmental value. Additionally, without proper environmental assessments, this project poses risks of increased traffic and greenhouse gas emissions. As with the gridlock issue, meaningful solutions lie in robust public transit infrastructure and support for alternative mobility options, like bike lanes.\nOne must question whether credentialed experts, such as planners, environmentalists, or engineers, were consulted during the drafting of this bill.\nIn summary, Bill 212 takes a misguided approach to \u201creducing\u201d gridlock, likely achieving the opposite result. It risks worsening congestion, endangering public safety, harming local economies, causing irreversible environmental damage, and negatively impacting public health. This bill should not proceed.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing in regards to \"Bill 212 - Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024 - Framework for bike lanes that require removal of a traffic lane.\"\nThe Province of Ontario website states:\n\"Prescribed municipalities would be required to seek provincial approval to allow for the implementation of new bicycle lanes (\u201cbike lanes\u201d) that require the removal of an existing lane of traffic. Approval will be based on a set of specified criteria, to be set out in guidance and/or regulation.\nThe proposed framework would also provide the province with the authority to require municipalities to submit information about existing bike lanes on municipal roads where an existing vehicle lane was removed. Based on the outcome of the review, a regulation could be made to require the removal of the bike lane and its return to a lane of traffic.\nThe framework is proposed to require the province to remove sections of the Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue bike lanes in the City of Toronto.\"\nThe level of government that should be responsible for installing, modifying and removing bike lanes is the City of Toronto.  The Province should not interfere with the City's management of this issue.  If voters in the City of Toronto wish bike lanes to be removed, they can vote for Councillors and Mayoral candidates who promise to remove them; this would be a more democratic approach to bike lanes.  If the government of the Province of Ontario is committed to democracy and allowing communities to make decisions about local issues, the Province should keep out of the decision-making process regarding bike lanes.\nAs a Torontonian who both drives and bicycles, I understand that heavy traffic can be frustrating to drivers.  The Bloor bike lanes replaced a \"part\" lane of traffic, so I do not believe that they made a significant difference to traffic flow.  There is no alternative east-west corridor that bicycles can use to get through the city (east-west side streets do not run continuously and there are many stop signs on side street routes).\nThere are many arterial roads in Toronto with no bike lanes.  Drivers have lots of options to get around Toronto.\nI implore the Province of Ontario to modify Bill 212 so that the City of Toronto can decide exclusively about the presence of bike lanes in the city.\n"

        "comment": "This decision would have a devastating detrimental impact on Toronto's cycling network, and is a terrible idea. Many condominium developments today are being built with more bike parking than car parking. Toronto bike share continues to post record ridership every year. Many people want to bike, but most won't, if there isn't safe infrastructure.\nAdding excessive regulation around bike lanes is bad for local businesses (which get significantly more traffic when bike lanes are implemented) and overreaching with a one size fits all approach to cities. It is prioritizing the needs of entitled suburbanites, who visit occasionally, over the needs of actual residents who live downtown and use these bike lanes every day.\nFurthermore, car ownership and dependence as a model for everyone is bad for the environment, and creates economic inequality for people who either can't afford a car, or can't drive. Whereas building bike lanes actually gets cars off the road (making driving more enjoyable for folks who still need to drive). In addition, bikes are dramatically more space efficient, (and for those who are able to cycle) better for your health than driving.\nI want to see Ontario investing more in public transit and encouraging cities to build more bike infrastructure. The policy being proposed is the complete opposite of what I think would be best for this province. And not just for Toronto; disincentivizing car use and building protected bike infrastructure would dramatically improve life for residents of cities like London and Ottawa as well.\nI urge you to reconsider this legislation and try to take a collaborative, evidence-based approach where cities (like Toronto, for example, who have already done numerous studies on the effects of bike lanes) can be part of the solution for reducing congestion by encouraging other modes of transportation and keeping pedestrians and cyclists safe.\n"
