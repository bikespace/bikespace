Without them, you will have cars and bikes together on the same narrow road, causing cars to move slower in and around the individuals cycling.

        "comment": "Dear Government of Ontario,\nAs a driver and pedestrian in this city, I would like to emphatically state that the bike lanes added to this city, especially Bloor and Danforth, have improved this city. Toronto joins the ranks of Amsterdam, Paris, Copenhagen, New York City and many more world class cities as livable, efficient, large metropolises.\nAs a driver, these bike lanes on the major Toronto roads makes driving a more ordered, less stressful and safer experience. Why? Because cyclists are in their own lanes. I don\u2019t have to worry about them dodging in and out of traffic, causing distraction and stress. I can pay attention to vehicular traffic knowing the bikes have their own lights and lanes to obey. Same goes for pedestrians, who now also have better and more effective traffic lights and signage.\nAs a pedestrian, our streets, especially Bloor-Danforth, have become more beautiful and inviting. I now do more shopping and eating out in my neighbourhood. With installation of these bike-lanes, sidewalks have been made wider, there is outdoor seating for cafes and restaurants, there is sidewalk space for retails shops to display their wares, and the mess of traffic at intersections is easier and safer to navigate.\nSo, I implore, even demand that the bike lanes on Bloor-Danforth, Yonge and University Avenues remain in place. Do not rip them up.\nAs for the Ontario Government attempting to pass legislation to have jurisdiction over municipalities power to choose, to plan and build their own bike lanes (or not), I emphatically object. This represents a gross overreach of provincial power over the democratically elected mayors and councils. The provincial government does not have the moral authority, and it should definitely not have the legal authority to dictate to elected municipal governments how to govern and operate their own cities or towns. The provincial government represents the province, municipal governments represent municipal constituencies, ie. the people who live here. Please, do not infringe on our rights as citizens to have our municipal governments to represent us.\nThank you for your time and consideration.\nRespectfully yours,\nToronto resident and citizen.\n"

        "comment": "There are numerous ways to reduce driving times in the city, and I do not believe that removing bike paths is one of them. To ensure faster travel times for all Torontonians, methods of travel should be diversified. Travel by bike and public transit should be accessible, affordable and safe for all. The obvious irony is, by encouraging more people to travel in ways that aren't cars, car traffic would actually get better. Streetcar and bus travel times would reduce too.\nPassenger vehicle travel times should not be the only consideration here, either. We must also consider the health and wellbeing of the residents of this city. Noise pollution from traffic and emissions from gas-powered vehicles contributes to air pollution, which increases the health risks to those exposed. The government estimates that air pollution led to 6.6k premature deaths in Ontario in 2021. And then there's the psychical safety of cyclists, drivers and pedestrians, which is threatened by the removal of safe bike lanes. How many more cyclists will experience injury or death in the city if we throw them into traffic?\nI live in this city and I want to bike. Providing safe and extensive cycle networks is imperative to this. This proposal is shocking to me. I cannot believe that the provincial government backs such an archaic, short-sighted and damaging proposal. As a society, we need to de-center passenger vehicles as the primary mode of transport to ensure the safety and health of residents and the environment.\n"

The newly introduced downtown bike lanes have been absolutely critical to my daily safety. I use them every day. Remove them would be a grotesque misuse of public funds that will put lives in jeopardy. Whatever psychotic political game Doug Ford is playing boils my blood and is based on no evidence that suggests removal of bike lanes is a good idea. He is hell bent on destroying Toronto.

        "comment": "I support the removal of bike lanes along Bloor Street from Runnymede to Aberfoyle. The new lanes were installed in blind pursuit of a policy, and were not installed with community needs in mind. The new lanes and related infrastructure create a lot of visual clutter, making it confusing and stressful to drive. They also create congestion in a part of the city THAT IS UNDERSERVED BY TRANSIT. These lanes are choking us.\nI also support the removal of the new, but incomplete, bicycle infrastructure located at the intersection of Jane Steet and Baby Point Road, at the gates. This unnecessary separated bike line has made an already complicated intersection MORE DANGEROUS by making it more complex.\nFinally, I do not support the removal of all bike lanes on downtown thoroughfares. I believe their effectiveness should be examined in the downtown context. But out in the west end, it makes no sense to allocate 50% of the roadway to 87 drivers per day. There is insufficient density and too much sprawl to merit them on Bloor. I would welcome the opportunity for them to be moved to another street as I believe bicycle infrastructure does keep cyclists in a safe zone, which also helps the flow of traffic.\n"

The removal of bike lanes will not only cause more traffic in busy areas, as typically the construction (in this case, destruction) process can take up to several months to complete\u2014 therefore, along with the several other major construction projects, this would pose more traffic and congestion on our busiest streets. The removal of bike lanes will also not get rid of bikers, nor should we discourage people from biking, therefore bikers would have no choice but to dangerously ride alongside drivers or on pedestrian sidewalks. This would create a higher risk of accidents between bikers, drivers and pedestrians. Please reconsider this bill as this would create a massive disservice for all commuters in the city.\n"

Much of the boom in residential density across Toronto relies on providing bicycle parking instead of vehicular and we risk losing functioning housing and the ability for housing to be built by enacting Bill 212. Consequently this current legislation undermines the provincial goverment's own legislation 'Cutting Red Tape to Build More Homes Act'.\n"

        "comment": "I am a resident of Bloor West Village in Toronto.  My family supports the removal of the bike lanes along Bloor, not only from Runnymede west, but east of Runnymede as well.  Anecdotally, many residents in the area feel the same way, even those who often cycle.\nI am not opposed to bike lanes in principle, but I am opposed to both the design and location of these particular lanes.  They may address some safety concerns but they create others, and there is no reason for them to be located on this street.\n1.  As a driver, it is extremely difficult for me to see bicycles coming when I'm turning left off Bloor, as they are obscured by the lane of parked cars and my attention is taken up by buses and pedestrians at the  intersection.  When turning right, for the same reason, I must pull over and block the bike lane to ensure that the car does not turn into a cyclist that cannot be seen (and who chooses to pass a turning car on the right.  A dangerous situation exists at the bottom of the hill near High Park, where cyclists could be travelling at 30 to 40 km/hour in the bike lane towards cars waiting to turn right off Bloor.\n2. The parking lane is too narrow.  It requires drivers to open their door into a live lane of traffic, and makes it unsafe to retrieve an elderly person or child from a car seat in the back seat.  While somewhat safer on the bike lane side, it still requires opening a door into the bike lane and emptying an unsteady person or stroller into the bike lane.  This assumes that the car doors are not blocked by the ridiculous bollards.  The design creates accessibility issues for the disabled as well the elderly and families with small children.  In the blind pursuit of making cycling safer, the safety of others has been compromised. (As an aside, the behaviour of many cyclists adds to the safety problem - without exaggeration, I see cyclists driving the wrong way down a street or even in the bike lanes, riding on the sidewalks, and/or blasting through stop signs and red lights without stopping EVERY TIME I go out.  And then there's the failure to wear a helmet....)\n3.  The bike lanes are rarely used in this section of the City and it is difficult to imagine any scenario where they will ever come close to replacing cars and public transit. The City's own usage data bears this out.  Well under 1% of trips (only a few hundred per day at best) along this section are taken by cyclists, even in good weather.  There are tens of thousands of people living in the surrounding area.  The introduction of the bike lanes had no meaningful reduction on the number of car trips.  I would also note that the data does not explain whether the additional cyclists on Bloor after installation were existing cyclists or changed their routes from side streets to use the lanes, meaning no or little net new cyclists.  (How many were using Annette Street, Harbord, the Queensway before?). The data has also not been presented in relation to the City's population growth (i.e. as the population grows, so proportionately will the population of cyclists to some degree, but is it more, or less?). Similarly, it is not possible to know from the data whether the small reduction in car trips is due to drivers using side streets to avoid the new congestion on Bloor.\n4. It is unacceptable for a short trip of a few hundred metres to take two to 4 minutes longer (double).  That is a massive increase in travel time and is made worse if someone is travelling longer distances on Bloor, as each of those delays add up.  I have personally witnessed the additional congestion around Bloor/Jane/South Kingsway as a result of the changes.  I have also witnessed, on numerous occasions, emergency vehicles stuck with nowhere to go until a light changes, as there is no where for cars to pull over to the right to let them through until the light turns green.\n5.  Why are we putting bike lanes directly on top of a route with a subway on it?  There is already an alternative option to cars built right under this street.\n6.  On a point related to #5, Bloor Street is where shuttle buses need to run when the subway is down.  It is total gridlock during rush hour when the shuttle buses need to run and just as bad on weekends, because there is not enough room for them.\n7. Government money should be shovelled into public transit.  That is the realistic way people will be able to reduce their reliance on vehicles.\n"

        "comment": "Ontario's Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, which aims to improve transportation infrastructure and reduce traffic congestion, is a proposal that may sound promising on the surface, but upon closer examination, it reveals several flaws that could worsen the problem it seeks to address and ultimately lead to long-term negative consequences.\n1. Overemphasis on Expanding Road Infrastructure\nOne of the central components of the Act is the expansion of road networks and highways to alleviate gridlock. While this may seem like a direct solution to traffic problems, it fails to account for the well-established phenomenon of induced demand. This concept suggests that simply building more roads encourages more people to drive, which can actually increase congestion in the long run. Rather than reducing gridlock, expanding infrastructure often leads to even worse traffic as more vehicles take advantage of the newly constructed lanes, quickly filling them up. This cycle of endless road expansion is not a sustainable solution and could ultimately lead to a \u201cbigger is worse\u201d situation.\n2. Environmental Impact and Urban Sprawl\nThe Act\u2019s focus on road-building and expanding highways also overlooks the environmental consequences of such projects. More roads lead to greater carbon emissions, which is a direct contradiction to Ontario\u2019s climate goals. The construction and maintenance of highways require significant energy and materials, and increased car usage contributes to air pollution and worsens the province's carbon footprint. Additionally, expanding highways encourages urban sprawl, as more land is developed for new housing, businesses, and industries along major roadways. This sprawl can diminish green spaces, harm ecosystems, and increase the pressure on municipal services in new suburban areas.\n3. Neglecting Public Transit and Active Transportation\nThe Act\u2019s focus on roads and highways overlooks the crucial role of public transportation and active transportation (e.g., walking and cycling) in solving gridlock. For Ontario to truly reduce traffic congestion and improve quality of life, the government needs to prioritize investments in transit systems, such as buses, subways, and commuter trains. Expanding these systems would provide Ontarians with viable alternatives to driving, reducing the overall number of vehicles on the road. The Act should also place a stronger emphasis on creating safe cycling lanes and pedestrian pathways to encourage active modes of transport. By neglecting these areas, the government is not addressing the underlying need for sustainable transportation solutions.\n4. Lack of Focus on Congestion Pricing and Demand Management\nInstead of simply building more roads, Ontario should explore solutions that manage traffic demand. Measures like congestion pricing, which charges vehicles to enter high-traffic areas during peak hours, have proven effective in cities around the world, such as London and New York. The Act misses this opportunity to implement more sophisticated strategies to reduce congestion in a way that encourages people to take public transit or adjust their travel habits. Without addressing demand management, the province risks continuing to support a car-dependent culture, which exacerbates gridlock rather than alleviating it.\n5. Impact on Local Communities and Quality of Life\nThe expansion of highways and road networks under this Act could have detrimental effects on local communities. New roads often pass through residential neighborhoods, leading to increased noise, pollution, and the disruption of local businesses. These communities may find themselves trapped between expanding highways and deteriorating environmental conditions, ultimately reducing their quality of life. Additionally, road expansion can lead to displacement of existing residents, particularly in underprivileged areas, who may be forced to relocate due to construction projects or gentrification driven by increased access to transportation corridors.\n6. Missed Opportunity for Innovative Solutions\nInstead of continuing with outdated and car-centric solutions, the Ontario government should be looking for more innovative transportation alternatives. This could include increasing investment in shared mobility services like carpooling, ride-hailing, and autonomous vehicles. There is also potential to integrate smart traffic management systems that can reduce congestion by optimizing traffic flow. These technologies are not given enough attention in the Act, which suggests the government is still focused on old models of transportation infrastructure that may no longer be the most effective in addressing modern challenges.\nConclusion\nWhile the Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act proposes a solution to Ontario's traffic problems, its heavy reliance on expanding road infrastructure and neglect of alternative transportation options are shortsighted and ineffective in the long run. The government\u2019s focus on road construction is likely to exacerbate traffic congestion, contribute to environmental degradation, and encourage urban sprawl. To truly solve Ontario's gridlock issues, the government should prioritize sustainable transportation solutions, such as investing in public transit, improving active transportation infrastructure, and adopting congestion pricing and demand management strategies. Without these measures, the Act risks perpetuating the very problems it intends to resolve.\n"

        "comment": "While I appreciate that there are some members of our community that travel by bikes. I do not believe this implementation was done in a thoughtful or inclusive manner. As a healthcare leader that lives in the west end of Toronto, I rely on these impacted roads such as Bloor Street to commute downtown for my job. I can easily say that it has at minimum doubled my commute time as a result of these changes. Further, I hear from my staff and colleagues on how difficult their commutes have become and that they do not wish to work in downtown hospitals as a result. Unfortunately, as I am sure you are aware, many of the most specialized hospitals are in the downtown area and are depended on by thousands of Ontarian's each year to receive the most intensive and complex care needs. Further, I have personally witnessed more aggressive and frustrated drivers, that are to an extent justified in their emotions. It is without debate that Toronto's public transit system is sub-par in performance to other global cities, and often dangerous. I point you to many public news articles and eye-witness testimonies from day to day public transit users in Toronto as an exhibit of its extremely disappointing service and infrastructure. These new bike lanes have created an environment that is unfathomable for those that are simply trying to work and live.\nOn a personal level, I have stopped frequenting many businesses along these bike lanes due to longer commutes, less parking availabilities and general inconvenience. As a resident of Etobicoke, we frequented many restaurants and local businesses along Bloor Street in the past. Upon installation of these bike lanes we have stopped attending these businesses not due to their respective faults, but due to the business unfriendly environment that the City of Toronto imposed on them. It is truly unfair and punitive that the City would introduce such measures to local businesses that are trying to survive after many years of hardship during the pandemic.\nFurther, I ask what design studies were conducted in creating these bike lanes. The City speaks as if inclusivity and accessibility is a key driver of their initiatives. I argue that not only were these bike lanes not created with thought, but that they do not even meet the requirements of AODA. To provide an anecdotal example, I have an elderly mother who has movement issues that I often accompany to medical appointments. Unfortunately, one of her appointments were along the newly minted Bloor Street bike lanes. Not only was finding a parking spot nearby nearly impossible, once we did find a parking spot, and she exited from the passenger side and she nearly tripped on the rock dividers almost getting hit by a cyclist that was travelling at an extremely excessive speed.\nI urge the Province to step in and remove these bike lanes. These lanes are not only an inconvenience, but are dangerous and have created an environment that is not conducive to growing and living in Ontario. Thank you for you attention to this important matter.\n"

While I understand the intent of alleviating traffic on Highway 401, expanding highways is a short-term solution that often leads to induced demand and ultimately increasing congestion rather than reducing it.\nInvesting in sustainable alternatives like public transit and cycling infrastructure has been consistently proven to be more effective in reducing traffic congestion and lowering emissions. By discouraging bike lanes, we risk further entrenching car dependency, neglecting the health, environmental, and community benefits that active transportation brings.\nAdditionally, the proposed Highway 413 raises significant environmental concerns. Building this toll road through Ontario Crown Lands would lead to the destruction of vital natural habitats, threaten biodiversity, and compromise green spaces that are essential to our province\u2019s ecological health. Once these lands are developed, their loss is irreversible.\nI urge the government to reconsider the approach outlined in Bill 212. Instead of expanding highways, let us prioritize investments in robust public transit systems and active transportation infrastructure. These solutions align better with long-term sustainability goals and the needs of Ontario\u2019s growing population.\n"

The proposed bike lane removals in Toronto would actually encourage more people to drive along those streets through induced demand and removal of travel options.\nIn purely fiscal conservative arguments, the proposed bill is myopic. It would cost 10s of millions of dollars to remove the bike lanes, reduce incomes for local businesses along those streets (average store revenue in the Danforth is up since the lanes were introduced), and emergency service costs would increase with increased injuries from collisions (plus the additional medical costs and lost labour costs).\nFrom a small government perspective, this bill goes against each value of the Conservative party. Let the cities govern themselves, and allow people the option to travel how they wish. You want a car, from a small Prius to a huge lifted truck? Go for it, that's your right to choose. Do you want to ride a bike or scooter, or walk? That is up to the individual. Removing these bike lanes limits options, and forces more people into cars, probably raising household debts.\nThis bill serves only to stick it to Toronto, nothing more.\n"
