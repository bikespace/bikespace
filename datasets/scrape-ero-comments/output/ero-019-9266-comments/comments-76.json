It should be its own separate thing or lump it in with a bill to break up monopolies like Rogers, Bell and Telus.\nAlso, please do not force the removal of bike lanes. I do not use a bike to get around the city but I have seen a vast improvement to the safety of all travellers with it in place. I no longer need to worry about people cutting into my lane at the last minute to avoid someone who has illegally parked. The bike lanes were paid for by city funds, let us become like every world class city and have accessibility for all users.\n"

        "comment": "Providing alternative, efficient and safe ways for people to commute is a the most effective method of reducing congestion. Removing quality infrastructure that keeps bikes and cars separated is the opposite of this. Adding more lanes for cars does nothing to stop gridlock when there are other bottlenecks at intersections, and will encourage more people to drive. Providing safe and fast routes to bike will keep cars off the road.\nFurthermore, the province of Ontario has no place telling cities what to do in these circumstances, when the have already conducted traffic studies and done the planning necessary to build the right infrastructure. This bill is shameful and ignorant meddling, drags the province backward and has no place in our society.\n"

Please focus on improving public transportation to reduce the number of cars instead of removing a vital and successful method of transportation.\nRemoval will not result in improved traffic - it will result in more cyclist deaths, accidents, and likely slower traffic due to cyclists needing to seize the entire lane for safety reasons.\n"

More people using active transit means less cars on the roads, lessening congestion for the cars and vehicles that need to be there. Without bike lanes less people people feel safe biking on our roads. Bike produce far far less pollution than cars, even electric vehicles, both in the manufacturing process and through tire wear microplastics. Bikes are accessible to children and youth and provide freedom of movement for many people who may not be able to or want to drive. Are the future deaths of cyclists and pedestrians worth the minimal amount of time saved (that is until induced demand makes traffic worse again)?\n"

Bike lanes serve many purposes which includes preventing deaths and to ease congestion by promoting better alternatives to transportation without having to rely on motor vehicles.\nThe province has no logical excuse to butt-in a cities decision to implement or remove bike lane infrastructure.\nIt is my hope that this bill does not pass.\n"

        "comment": "Really disappointed at the potential removal of bike lanes. Bike lanes make our cities more accessible for people who do not have access to a vehicle or wish to lower their environmental impact. This is extremely telling that this Conservative government does not care about people with no vehicular assets. Many people do not have cars, especially in our cities. Deeply, incredibly disappointing. I hate living in a province where our government actively shows that it doesn\u2019t care about all of its people.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to Bill 212, which proposes a framework for bike lanes that require the removal of existing traffic lanes. This bill not only risks wasting taxpayer dollars by potentially removing already established bike lanes, but it also adds unnecessary red tape to municipal projects that are vital for maintaining efficient traffic flow and safety.\nThe requirement for provincial approval to implement new bike lanes creates a bureaucratic hurdle that could delay critical infrastructure projects. Instead of expediting solutions to alleviate traffic congestion, this bill could hinder progress and lead to longer wait times for necessary improvements.\nFurthermore, this proposal contradicts extensive studies and empirical evidence that demonstrate bike lanes can actually reduce traffic congestion by encouraging cycling and decreasing reliance on motor vehicles. By undermining existing bike lanes and imposing additional regulations, the government is disregarding the proven benefits of promoting sustainable transportation.\nIn summary, Bill 212 not only risks wasting public funds on the removal of effective infrastructure but also introduces red tape that could further complicate and delay essential projects. I urge you to reconsider this bill and prioritize evidence-based strategies that truly address the issue of gridlock in Ontario.\n"

        "comment": "Restricting bike lanes is the opposite of what we should be doing to reduce grid lock and traffic jams. More people on bikes greatly reduces traffic, and we should be encouraging and enabling bicycle traffic whenever we can.\nAdding more bike lanes encourages people to get a bike and ride it whenever they can instead of driving. If people know they can get to their destination without having to navigate regular road lanes, they can feel safer and more confident choosing a bike.\nRemoving or limiting bike lanes means those who still choose to ride a bike will end up slowing down traffic in the car lanes - where they now have to ride.\n"

        "comment": "I applaud this initiative by the Provincial Conservative government. The idealistic and unpractical idea of bicycle lanes at the expense of other vehicular traffic disregards the practical considerations around implementing such modes of transportation in a country where we spend a good deal of the year with conditions in-conducive to cycling for all but the most dedicated cyclists.\nIn my hometown of Ottawa, a well known and highly publicized bike lane was installed on O\u2019Connor St at the expense of one lane of vehicular traffic some years ago. Throughout this time, this bike lane has sat largely unused for the 6 colder months of the year, while gridlock plagues the mass exodus of vehicles from downtown as federal civil servants return home at the end of their workday. This is but one example of a city wide issue that is politically fashionable, but impractical for most and disadvantageous to all but the very few who expect special treatment.\nThe mass expansion of bike lanes has not only proved increasingly challenging for other road users facing increased congestion, but is worsened by the constant disregard and sense of entitlement exhibited by many cyclists. Bike lanes from this perspective have provided a sense of entitlement to many cyclists who blatantly disregard the rules of the road. Collision statistics dictate that cyclists are very often the cause of accidents, and not the innocent victims they often portray themselves to be.\nRecent national Census data indicates that less than 300,000 Canadians classify their main method of commuting to be through cycling. This equates to less than 1% of our national population. Logic would dictate this group would be best served to adapt to existing infrastructure, and not expect special treatment.\nCyclists need be reminded that they are in fact the minority, that traffic laws apply to them as well, and that the interests of the majority outweigh the needs of their very vocal minority.  I fully support this initiative by the Provincial government and look forward to seeing this legislation implemented.\n"

Don't actually destroy any bike lanes, it's a huge waste of our money, will make congestion worse, and will cause the deaths of many bikers.\nIf you take the lanes out, I am not going to disappear. I will still be there. It's faster and cheaper for me to ride my bike to where I need to go, rather than drive.\nYou know who won't be going anywhere fast?\nYou. I will seize the lane. I will be in front of you. I will stop at every stop. I will ruin your day, every day.\nBike lanes prevent traffic.\n"

I use transit and it is transit infrastructure that should be the priority. Bike lanes are being used a as scape goat for the fact that transit sucks leading to too many cars and congestion.\nBike lane removal will cost cyclist lives. Bike removal is not a solution that is going to make a dent in the congestion of toronto.\nI am also aware that cycling infrastructure can be tried to lower healthcare costs. Healthcare cost are a provincial priority for me. I don't see any level of excitement from this government on healthcare equating with Doug need to have everyone drive. That is frustrating.\n"
