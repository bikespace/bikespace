        "comment": "This piece of legislation is a massive provincial overreach into municipal jurisdiction. Individual communities, not the province, should have authority over their internal roads and how they would like to use them. If communities wish to provide infrastructure to allow for safer cycling routes that should be their decision to make. The province has not proven that removing and limiting bike lanes improves vehicular traffic and many experts have found the opposite in their research. Finally, it is unfair to use provincial funds collected from the province as a whole to remove infrastructure paid for and wanted by individual communities.\n"

I am able to do this because the network of bike lanes makes it safe to get around in a bike.\nWithout bike infrastructure to make the journeys safe, I will have to go back to using my car for more trips, increasing traffic and contributing to pollution and fossil fuel usage.\n"

        "comment": "I am a resident of Oakville, ON and I wish to state my outright objection to this proposal. Bike lanes objectively, empirically, do not create additional traffic congestion. Nor does adding more car lanes actually ease traffic congestion, perhaps beyond a year or two, thanks to induced demand. I am a young disabled person who cannot drive for medical reasons - my ebike is my freedom. But not when I'm placed in danger with a lack of safe bike infrastructure. It is incredibly taxing to me to have to pay a considerable sum for a cab to reach a location that I cannot get to on the bus, could not walk to, but could bike to IF IT WERE SAFE. But it isn't. Side streets are simply not a solution - they're convoluted and indirect. In many suburbs, side streets are crescents that don't go anywhere - main roads are the ONLY OPTION. In Oakville we have many walking paths which are mixed use which can be an option, but similarly they are not straightforward to navigate and rarely have curb cuts or signals where you have to cross the road to continue on the trail. Additionally, side streets are generally too narrow to accommodate bike lanes even if the actual route of the roads wasn't an issue, which it is. As a taxpayer, I strongly object to my tax dollars being used to remove infrastructure that was already paid for in ways that actively endanger me as a citizen and restrict my freedom of movement. Some trips need to be made in a car, and always will - but many DON'T, or only need to be now because of design choices in our communities. The absolute best way to reduce gridlock is to make it incredibly easy and convenient for as many trips as reasonably possible to be made without a car. Drivers should support bike lanes - every new cyclist is one less car they have to compete with on the road. And approaching the problem from a diversion perspective is incredibly empowering and freeing for those of us who can't drive, particularly as car-dependent community design is a massive barrier to employment for people like me. I ask that you strongly reconsider this proposal, which uses taxpayer money to restrict citizens' freedom of movement and increase the danger they face when traveling, with absolutely no basis in empirical evidence that it will actually achieve the supposed objective.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 is a waste of taxpayer money! All evidence shows bike lanes reduce traffic and are safer for people who chose to bike in a car dominated world. Every bike on the road is one less car contributing to the traffic problem, we have already seen building more and more lanes for cars has done nothing but bring more cars and more traffic. Why is this provincial government so focused on municipal issues? Focus on the things we need to fund for the whole province like healthcare, education and housing. This current government has done nothing but waste taxpayer money and make life worse.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose the removal of already installed bike lanes as well as the province's proposed involvement in municipal road and traffic matters.\nDecades of studies in several countries have shown that bike lanes reduce traffic as they provide an alternative mode of transportation and boost local business. Toronto is not an exception to the rule nor is any other Ontario city. Bike lanes provide a safe mode of travel. If the province truly cared about easing congestion, the government should invest in transit expansion, incentivize work from home for those professions that don't require to commute and ensure others can work closer to home instead of building more and more roads (which just induces even more traffic). This is a PLANNING issue, stop wasting taxpayer money on irrelevant topics, especially removal of already constructed bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "Why is this bill even being seriously considered. The data shows that providing alternatives to driving is the best way to reduce car traffic: less drivers on the road leads to less traffic. Giving more leeway to highways, when the focus on cars has caused traffic to worsen, just makes no sense to me. The wording of this bill also confused me since it appears to advocate for bike lanes, but seems to be more preoccupied with building highways and reinstating car lanes, which I don\u2019t want. As an Ontarian, I sincerely hope the government of ontario throws this bill out. Please focus on data-driven solutions to car traffic in ontario. Maybe you could invest in trans provincial rail?\n"

With the current realty of Climate Change, green transportation is a must to help reduce our carbon emissions. I'm utterly disappointed in our current provincial government for not putting safety and the environment ahead of cars. We need to look to European countries such as Germany, the Netherlands, etc... and model our transportation systems after them.\n"

        "comment": "I am commenting as a concerned Ontarian living in a rural area who commutes by car to an urban setting and as an avid cyclist.  I want to express my strong opposition to any potential legislation that would limit my municipality's ability to effectively plan and implement safe cycling infrastructure, particularly bike lanes by adding more red tape.\nIntroducing provincial oversight into the approval process for bike lanes would only add unnecessary bureaucracy, exacerbating the delays that already plague many projects in our city. Instead of streamlining these initiatives, we risk creating further obstacles that hinder our ability to develop the safe, accessible cycling infrastructure our community desperately needs.\nWe are currently facing a climate crisis, and it is crucial for all levels of government to seize every opportunity to promote safe, healthy, and environmentally friendly modes of transportation. Bike lanes not only encourage cycling as a viable alternative to driving, but they also enhance the safety of all road users. Personally, I feel safer biking on roads with designated bike lanes, and I believe drivers also feel more secure knowing there are clear, marked spaces for cyclists. Prioritizing bike lanes, even at the expense of some car lanes, is a step toward fostering a more sustainable and livable community.\nI urge you to dismiss this proposal and any future proposals that would undermine my local government's ability to make decisions regarding cycling infrastructure.\n"

It only makes it more unsafe for pedestrians and motorists.\nThis is an irrational move for a provincial decision as the provincial government has larger implications to focus on. The provincial government should not interfere with cycling lanes, and must take additional steps to understand and collaborate with the needs of the city. It does not align with the policies in Chapter Three \"Building a Successful City\" in Section 15 of Toronto's Official Plan.\nInevitably, more people will try to drive and traffic will pile up again, especially as density increases. Additional modes of transportation like cycling, creates an equal distribution and alternatives for transit.\nDo not remove the bike lanes.\nWe should be prioritizing active transportation and transit, not wasting money on this.\n"

        "comment": "This is an absurd bill that will only further congestion and increase risk of pedestrians and cyclists. I am vehemently opposed to legislation that furthers dependence on personal vehicle use while removing protections for rapid transit lanes (with already ailing transport systems) and preventing development of safe cycling and pedestrian infrastructure (which can actually alleviate congestion). This bill is counter to many transport studies and does not promote sustainable future transport. There needs to be support for rapid transit lanes, bicycle lanes and pedestrian paths - not legislation preventing those things. Pedestrian infrastructure is barely sufficient as is (absence of sidewalks on most streets, very narrow where it does exist) and to prevent this because it could impact vehicle use (which is already given so much more space) is disheartening and a regressive step for Ontarians as a whole.\n"

        "comment": "Taking away dedicated bike infrastructure from cyclists won't suddenly convince those cyclists to drive for their commutes. The benefits of cycling are too numerous to abandon: improved physical and mental health (ergo, savings to future health care costs), less damage to roads from negligible vehicular weight, personal cost savings (no insurance, no gas, little maintenance), and massive reductions to climate emissions (assuming your government cares about science). Bike commutes are also often faster than taking public transit or even driving.\nWhat WILL happen is that those cyclists will now be directly in the path of large, heavy, potentially deadly automobiles which ... will get stuck behind said cyclists.\nWhat exactly are you accomplishing by doing this, apart from sowing even more division in our society? Have you considered removing sidewalks to improve vehicular traffic further? Do you know about induced demand as it relates to adding car lanes (see link), and do you even care?\n"
