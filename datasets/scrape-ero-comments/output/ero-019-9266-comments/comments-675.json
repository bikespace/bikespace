        "comment": "As an Ontario physician and citizen, I am writing here to emphasise several concerns raised by Bill 212.\nI recently witnessed an ambulance picking up an injured individual at the scene of a bicycle versus car collision on the southeastern corner of College and Bay streets in Toronto, right after the College St cycling lane ends abruptly. Unfortunately, we all know that there are many such cases of cyclists injured or dying in recent years.\nWhile this left me with a personal attachment to the subject, I would also hope that policy decisions be driven by data. Fortunately, in the case of Toronto, homegrown data exist. A 2012 report by Toronto Public Health estimated that 49 yearly deaths were prevented by the 80,000 Ontarians who travelled by bicycle in the city in 2012. Indeed, despite the tragedies of lives lost in road collisions and the absence of safe cycling infrastructure in 2012, cycling saved lives. I would assume that the number of deaths prevented by cycling has only increased in the 12 years since then, given the increased number of cyclists (notably through Bike Share) and dedicated cycling infrastructure built since 2016 enhancing cycling safety.\nIt is notable that Toronto road user fatalities hit a peak in 2016 and have since trended down in absolute numbers. The Bloor St bike lane pilot started in 2016, highlighting that safer cycling infrastructure is at least part of a safer transport system.\nThe 2012 study conducted in Toronto also found that the total economic benefits of active transportation in Toronto range from $130 million to $478 million. This includes reduced health care spending of $110 to $160 million for the province due to use of active transport, as well as preventing costs associated with cyclist-vehicle collisions. As a physician, I would also highlight the priceless wellbeing and physical health benefits of improved mental health and increased longevity, among others, afforded by active transport.\nMoreover, I contend that Bill 212 is counter-intuitive. While it is not my field of expertise, I am familiar with scientific evidence in urban design from many countries that increasing the number of car lanes on a given thoroughfare does not effectively reduce travel times between given destinations due to induced demand. Conversely, the fact that the proportion of road users that are cyclists is up to 15% in Toronto neighbourhoods where cycling infrastructure has seen recent modest upgrades, compared to the 2% average of people cycling for transit city-wide, demonstrates that induced demand also exists for cycling. However, unlike with our current car lanes, cycling infrastructure can handle the additional demand without leading to significant delays, because small bike lanes are sufficient to carry a large number of road users. Putting these two facts together naturally leads to the conclusion that building more and safer cycling infrastructure would actually reduce travel times for all road users - one only needs to imagine what would happen if there were suddenly 15% fewer cars on the road across the whole city. The economic and wellbeing benefits from the resulting increase in transport efficiency could not be under-stated.\nIn terms of the specific bike lanes on Bloor, Yonge, and University, I note that these are streets serviced by existing subway lines. Providing safe cycling options where there are existing transit lines is essential when designing multimodal transport that will increase transit ridership by offering convenient connections between destinations and transit stations, further contributing to reducing car traffic for those who need or want to use cars.\nWith all this being said, it is also important to remember that investments in public infrastructure are a matter of public trust and safety. Some road users cannot use automobiles, notably most school-aged children. Another City of Toronto report from 2019, \"Improving Road Safety of School-Age Children,\" states that addressing barriers to walking and cycling to school and could improve safety by reducing traffic around schools. Addressing these barriers includes providing families with safe routes that link neighbourhoods to schools and other community services. Indeed, I was astonished to learn from this report that among incidents of school-aged children killed or seriously injured on roadways, 64% occur on major arterials. We have a duty to protect children from fatal collisions not only on local residential streets but on all roads, and this report highlights that bike lanes are an important part of public safety.\nOn a similar note, why should these children grow up in a world where they do not have freedom of mobility until they get a driver's licence? What about kids who want to focus on school or career instead of studying for driving school, or those whose families don't have enough money for the financial liability of an additional motor vehicle? I believe we deserve freedom of choice when it comes to our means of transportation. In my case, I don't want the provincial government to decide for me when it comes to choosing my car, biking, or taking transit depending on what's appropriate to get around my city one a particular day. If a municipality decides to improve infrastructure to give its citizens more options, that should be their prerogative, because citizens get to vote on that in municipal elections. The idea of creating a provincial program to manage bike lanes across Ontario is totally counter to reducing provincial government waste and bureaucracy, because these relatively modest infrastructure upgrades are already being extensively studied and managed by municipalities.\nI would like to conclude my comment with some final personal insights. As both an automobile and bicycle user, I have experienced how road use is made more orderly by having a dedicated place for cyclists to go. When I am driving, I prefer when cyclists are out of my way and, when I'm cycling, I don't want to have to directly negotiate with car users. It's as simple as that - and I genuinely believe that road congestion is bad for car users, public transit, cyclists, pedestrians, and the surrounding communities and therefore worth addressing with government intervention. But not this one.\n"

Bicycles will help us fight the climate crisis. Every cycling journey is an emissions free journey.\nFurthermore, if we do it well, and create good bicycle infrastructure like in many cities around the world, we will reduce traffic congestion.\nOther benefits include a healthier population. Cycling is excellent exercise.\nI feel that eliminating bike infrastructure is a step backwards, into the past.\nBicycles need to be part of the future of our mobility.\n"

        "comment": "Retroactively removing bike infrastructure is beyond a waste of $48 million in taxpayer money, it's a violent act that will inevitably lead to the preventable deaths of more cyclists and pedestrians. A much better use of this money would go into improving the criminally under-funded TTC. This is surely more likely to reduce commute times than by deconstructing our arterial roads into highways. The notion that fewer bike lanes will mitigate gridlock is based in pseudoscientific, biased research. As an urban planner, I can assure you that induced demand works - and it won't work in your favour to reduce commute times for motorists.\nRegardless of the efficacy, cities are for people, not cars. If you care about your citizens, your priority should lie with making the city safer for people, not a more efficient thoroughfare for vehicular traffic. It should not be about saving drivers and businesses time and money, it should be about saving lives. 2024 is the deadliest year on record for cyclists in the GTA. This is not normal. Bill 212 will only further expedite this trend towards the death of more citizens, and thus the city.\nWe agree that time is precious, we all deserve more time to spend with our loved ones. However, Bill 212's insistence on removing poured-in and paid for infrastructure projects is senseless beyond economic measure and will undoubtedly lead to more death, and less time together.\n"

During 6 months of this back and forth, in our car I may add, we never witnessed a single instance of bikes or bike lanes being the cause of traffic.\nWhat we did see was a great number of staff at Toronto General and PMH getting to their jobs on their bicycles.\nRipping up existing bike lanes along Yonge, Bloor & University is not going to do ANYTHING to alleviate congestion in the downtown core, as long as you keep handing out construction permits to condo developments that bring dump trucks into already congested areas.\nIn addition, ripping up existing bike lanes is just going to move commuting cyclists, food delivery workers and everyone else into regular traffic lanes, so this proposal is the most nonsensical piece of legislation put forward by the premier.\n"

        "comment": "This Bill is a nightmare for cyclists and general traffic in Toronto.\nIn a world where we are trying to be environmental friendly, instead of encouraging people to give up cars and use non-polluting means of transportation, seems like the government wants to move in the opposite direction. This will lead to more pollution, congestion on the streets, more accidents, and overall chaos. It doesn't take rocket science to realize that cyclists require a separate space on roads and it is not just dangerous but also environmentally counter-productive to take the existing bike lanes away from the city. They were put there in place for a reason. We should be talking about adding bike lanes to every possible street instead taking away the whatever lowly amount of bike lanes that we currently have. I hope these comments are paid attention to.\n"

        "comment": "I vehemently oppose the Bill, as written. It boggles my mind why, in the 21st century, we want to be prioritizing motor vehicle traffic, with all of its negative environmental, safety, and health impacts, rather than making neighbourhoods better for walking, biking, and taking the bus, which are all better for the people using them -- and for everyone else in the community! -- than single-occupancy cars.\nI would be impressed with the Ford government if they could turn bike lanes, and transportation policy in general, from an example of identity politics to an example of evidence-based policymaking. The government would win big points with everyone, of every political stripe, if they followed the evidence. We do not need to reinvent the wheel. Look around the world at other \"world class cities\" -- Paris, London, NYC, Copenhagen, Amsterdam, Oslo -- and figure out what works and what doesn't. It has been proven time and time again that \"if you build it, they will come\" applies to non-car infrastructure. The idea that we are somehow different than the rest of the world is a strange one. Even Scandinavia is doing this, and their winters are like ours!\nPlease, turn this into something that even your more left-of-Conservative constituents will need to celebrate, instead of some regressive pro-car thing out of the 50s. We own a car and we own bikes, and we use both. Become \"pro-transportation\", not \"pro-car\".\n"

        "comment": "First, the province should not be rescinding decisions made by another level of government - especially  without any  clear evidence that their own decision is correct. This is blatant misuse of taxpayer money.\nSecond, it is vitally important that we move away from the use of fossil fuels as soon as possible. People have been trending in the other direction with larger and larger automobiles . This is more than counterproductive; it is suicidal. Most large city governments have realized that cities are for people - not hydrocarbon spewing machines. We need to join their ranks and take back some of the space the machines have encroached on in the last 100 years.\nThird, transit, walking and cycling are much healthier for people and the environment. We should be doing more to encourage those methods of locomotion. Cyclists need thoroughfares to easily get around: they take up much less room on the road and create much less wear and tear on the road.\nFourth, why does a person in/with a car have greater status than someone not in a car? Right now certain taxpayers matter more than others. I believe the status quo has it wrong. People should be rewarded for doing the right thing not the wrong thing. Cyclists pay the same taxes as everyone else - in fact they are much more likely to be the ones paying for the roads that they are using than motor vehicle drivers who could be from anywhere else- and often are.\n"
