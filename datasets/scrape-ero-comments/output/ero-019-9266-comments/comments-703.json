        "comment": "Only 1.2% commute by bicycle?! After hearing this statistic, I must say that it's disappointing to have these bike lanes in the streets and have only 1.2% of people commuting by bicycle. Exactly to the point, we're not doing enough!\nIf our meagre bike network has only encouraged such a small number of folks to ride their bicycles to work; then why not is this a call to action to expand and enrich cycling infrastructure? Cycling and other micro-mobility options are only feasible when there's a well connected infrastructure of safe bike lanes. A well plowed, maintained street with protected bike lanes is all for naught if every other street on one's route doesn't have similar treatment.\nWhy can't a common-sense approach factor give fair access to citizens and residents of any town or region to choose how they travel. Whose common sense are we referring to? I think it's common sense to encourage freedom of movement and making it clear that cycling is a viable alternative to driving. It's common sense to not dedicate such vast resources to a mode of transportation that struggles to be efficient in nearly all situations. We need to share our common spaces!\nSide roads in Toronto meander and are interrupted by many right-of-way conflicts. Further, there aren't many \"destinations\" on side-roads. Routes become convoluted and the added time of navigating these side-streets makes cycling undesirable.\nOnly 1.2%? (and I do recognize that this old number is a number of convenience and not representative of the needs of the downtown Toronto core) Exactly! We can do better. Help us do better!\n"

        "comment": "The Province's decision to remove bike lanes in Toronto (and to give itself that power) is a total disregard for the municipal governance and planning process. To be a first class city, we need to invest in safe bicycle intrastructure. People are DYING from unsafe biking. In a city like Toronto that is now mild from April - December, biking is one of the best ways to REDUCE congestion and promote a happy and health city. Just look at Denmark! The Province has politicized bike lanes, when this is a safety and basic infrastructure requirement for any city. Also, there has been NO data to show that removing the bike lanes will do anything to address congestion. Show us the data and the facts. Save lives.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes and/or cycling infrastructure are present on only 4% of Toronto\u2019s estimated 5,600 km of roads \u2013 it\u2019s absurd to suggest they are causing congestion in the City of Toronto.\nThe province offers no evidence/data to support this unfounded claim because none exists. In fact, the opposite is true as many studies show that bike lanes help reduce congestion, reduce vehicle speeds up to 28%, and calm streets.\nThe Eglinton Crosstown LRT \u2013 now 14 years in the making \u2013 along with the Finch West LRT and the Hurontario Light Rail Transit (LRT) remain unopened. These failed activations, along with many construction-related road closures, are primary factors contributing to the congestion in the city which has been ongoing for many years.\nThe recent Toronto Respecting Local Democracy and Cities \u2013 Supplemental Report: Impact of Bill 212 Bike Lanes clearly shows that ridership has rapidly increased where bike lanes and/or cycling infrastructure have been installed \u2013 up to 600+% - \u201cRidership along these corridors (Bloor St., Yonge St. and University Ave.) in 2024 has surpassed 750,000 users to-date.\u201d\nSafe bicycle lanes and/or cycling infrastructure helps get people out of cars removing vehicles from roads to ease congestion, while providing healthy, green and economic solutions for residents. This fact is true around the globe and supported by volumes of data.\nBike lanes are good for business which countless studies also show \u2013 the Bloor Annex BIA claims this as well and states \u201c\u2026removal of bike lanes would be disastrous.\u201d In one case study in Seattle when bike lanes replaced 12 parking spaces, sales quadrupled.\nWhy are major cities like Montreal, Paris, London, and NYC along with many others like Vancouver, Edmonton, Seattle, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, Austin, Portland etc. embracing cycling and continuing to build safe and efficient cycling networks\u2026?\nThe answer is simple Premier Ford and Minister Sarkaria \u2013 because it works.\nRemoving any bike infrastructure is unwarranted and a colossal and costly mistake that negates years of research, strategic planning and implementation, and discounts the tremendous work and careful consideration that goes on behind the scenes before, during and after bike lanes and other cycling infrastructure are installed.\nFurthermore, the lives and safety of countless workers, students, commuters, doctors, professionals, business people, politicians, mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers et al will be put at risk. Frankly it\u2019s shocking, disheartening and embarrassing to see and hear the province\u2019s rhetoric on the matter.\nWe need a culture shift, not a culture war or political stunts. Cycling is loved by everyone young and old \u2013 it\u2019s family policy around the world.\nThe legacy of supporting cycling, bike lanes and complete streets is proven and should be fully supported and expanded by this government.\n"

The safety of civilians who aim to commute via bike for various reasons (sustainability, morality, etc.) should not be put at risk by the removal of bike lanes in the downtown core. additionally, approval and permission for the installation of new bike lanes, simply continues to increase a lack safety and difficult conditions cyclists endure.\n"

Municipalities know best when and where to make changes to roadways.\n2. The province should be promoting and facilitating all forms of transportation, not just automobiles. Bicycles are a more efficient and environmentally friendly form of transportation and we should be adding separated bike lanes to allow safer and better experiences.\n3. Highway 413 should NOT be built and any new highways should undergo environmental assessments, including saving spaces for any affected species at risk.\n"

Having grown up in Bloor West Village, the extension of the Bloor bike lane is the single piece of most valuable infrastructure the city has done for my life.\nI go to sleep easy knowing my brother who worked for Uber eats can go to work and be safer than he was before.\nAnd I think about my friend, and fellow Humberside Collegiate alumni, Alex Amaro who was killed at the age of 23 in a bike collision near Dufferin mall - and how her death might have been avoided if we had proper cycling infrastructure in the city. Let her death not be in vain.\nPeople like me who do not own cars, pay taxes. We deserve to have a say in our public infrastructure.

It\u2019s ridiculous to take AWAY infrastructure that is integral to the cycling community, which is not just made up of hobbyists, but every person who commutes to work, or anywhere in the city.

        "comment": "The need for approval for bike lanes, and even more specifically the removal of them on major streets in Toronto is extremely detrimental. Bike lanes provide safetly for a large amount of our population which is not dependent on cars (ESPECIALLY in Toronto.) Focusing on \"motor vehicles\" and \"highways\" is also not a sustainable or smart decision in the long run- investment in green options (such as bike lanes) or more public transportation infrastructure is better environmentally and is able to help more citizens at once. Reducing traffic in busy streets by switching to a heavier focus on public transportation is also safer, rather than trying to jam in as many cars onto streets frequently used by pedestrians and bikers.\n- a university student in downtown Toronto\n"

        "comment": "It is shocking that there is a suggestion to remove the bike lanes that used a lot of materials and energy to build so soon after their construction. If the government believes the routes are not used enough to offset the small space they take up, I would like a study on the traffic conditions to be done. If in a couple years the streets need to be repaired then I would welcome an upgrade to the road that is backed by this traffic study. It does not make sense to say the project failed so soon after it's completion. There was still construction on parts of my route less than 3 months ago. (Bloor and St.George protected intersection)\nThese bike lanes remove gasoline guzzling cars from the road. I personally bought my bike and accessories second hand and therefore nothing new needed to be produced and no carbon emissions were created from my choice. This allows a clean source of transportation to be used around the city.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 would result in extremely regressive results for the climate by increasing the number of vehicles on the roads in the cities. Commuters which use bikes to get to and from work in the city centre would most likely revert to driving cars to work. This would also have a negative impact on traffic and result in worse gridlock.\nEliminating bike lanes would have make sidewalks more dangerous for pedestrians, especially seniors with canes and walkers. The number of bikes, including delivery and biking to work and recreational bikers would increase if the bike lanes they are currently using are removed. Particularly dangerous would be electric bike deliveries and electric scooter deliveries which are currently using bike lanes, but would resort to sidewalks rather than biking in traffic.\nDisabled individuals who currently use motorized bikes converted to their needs would be deprived of the ability to travel to places which they can currently access by using the bike lanes.\nDrivers need to adapt to bikers using the bike lanes, to be more alert, more patient and to budget the time required to travel safely and to ensure safety for bikers using bike lanes. I would also like to see license plates on bikes, so that those bikers endangering pedestrians or driving into the back of a vehicle stopped on the road at red lights, then taking off having caused damage could be held accountable.\n"
