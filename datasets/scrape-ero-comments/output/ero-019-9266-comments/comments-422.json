This proposal, and especially with the economic reasons that are being put forward, does not make sense. The accessibility challenge is in regards to commuting but also from a financial standpoint. Again, as we are trying to boost the economy and reduce our carbon print, we should not be removing bike lanes and not removing them on main roads like those.\n"

Your highway proposals and bike lane removals to benefit polluters and destroy the natural environment? Stupid! The streets you propose to remove bike lanes from are very long. You don\u2019t even bother to mention which sections. All of the bike lanes? There are no direct alternatives on secondary streets! Stop wasting our taxpayer dollars on your idiotic proposals and get to work solving serious issues and societal ills. No more blowhard nonsense.\n"

        "comment": "This policy shocked me as provinces in no way should be interfering with something SO local to Toronto, our bike lanes. Although I am not a cyclist, I would like to cycle, but in the suburbs of Toronto, there are not enough bike lane connections to get me far.\nToronto alone in 2024 had SIX cyclists KILLED on our roads. This is a clear sign that we need MORE, not less protection for cyclists. I was surprised that the Ontario government used false and outdated statistics to base their argument for this Bill, bike ridership is on the rise in Toronto, especially with the expanded bike share network. However, this province is doing Torontonians a failure.\nThis will make Toronto's journey to a modern city into a joke. Even if bikelanes were on side streets, there are no good sidestreets to replace Yonge, University or Bloor.\nThis is populous policy, it is corrupt government and I am ashamed of Doug Ford's tactic to win voters at the expense of Toronto's goals for a sustainable and innovative future. This policy will bring more gridlock to Toronto, waste MY and millions of other's taxpayer dollars on REVERSING OUR PROGRESS. UNBELIEVEABLE.\nShame to his corruption and lack of education.\n"

        "comment": "I don't think this bill goes far enough.\nHave we considered removing the sidewalks to add another lane of car traffic? It would make more sense to have the pedestrians just walk on the road with all the cars. Some of the pedestrians would die, but I drove so I would be ok.\nAlso, can we remove the traffic lights at the intersections? If there weren't any lights, my car could go faster as I wouldn't need to stop. There might be a few accidents and a few people would die, but my car is big and powerful so I would probably be ok.\nAlso, lane markings. Let's remove those. I'm tired of Olivia Chow telling me where I can and can't drive my car. Lane markings cause gridlock and keep me from seeing my family.\nAlso, can we remove the businesses on Bloor street? If we take those out we could get in at least 5-6 more lanes of traffic. And no one would even die.\nAlso sidewalks. Pedestrians are so entitled these days.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes provide scientifically supported benefits to cities. Research indicates that dedicated bike lanes significantly reduce cycling-related injuries, contributing to safer road conditions. They also help lower greenhouse gas emissions; replacing car trips with bike trips can cut transport emissions by up to 50%.\nHealth-wise, regular cycling reduces the risk of chronic diseases and lowers healthcare costs, as noted in studies from the *Journal of Transportation Health*. Additionally, neighborhoods with bike lanes often see increased local business activity, since cyclists are more likely to stop at shops.\nFinally, bike lanes can increase property values by 11% or more, according to the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy. Overall, bike lanes enhance safety, sustainability, public health, economic growth, and property values.\n"

        "comment": "I disagree with this new proposal. We should encourage people to bike more, and we can only do this by making biking safer. So many people drive to work and stores even though they live 10k  or less away...this needs to stop. We should invest more money into public transport and bike lanes (and painting them during the winter). Many studies have shown that more lanes of traffic don't directly correlate with less gridlock, and even if you may see results at first, they are usually negligible after a year. We should encourage people to walk, bike and take public transport as much as possible, and if you can't, you can drive.\n"

        "comment": "The proposal to remove bike lanes is a disingenuous attack on the City of Toronto, and on cyclists. Recall that the Premier's brother mocked and berated Torontonians who use bicycles as \"Pinkos\". The federal government invested some 400 million dollars to build safer cycling infrastructure in Toronto, and the Provincial government now proposes to spend our tax dollars removing it.\nCycling reduces gridlock. The evidence is ample from studies worldwide. A bicycle takes up far less space than a car. So does public transit. Both modes relieve gridlock.\nThe proposal privileges the most needy road users - cars and trucks - over the most space-efficient.\nI am a mother and I ride a bicycle. I transported my children when they were young by TTC and bicycle. I sustained \"life-changing injuries\" to my spine and neck when I was doored by a truck on King street. There was no bike lane, and the driver escaped with no consequences.\nWe all know that the solution to gridlock is investment in public transportation and yes, even cycling.\nThe safety of people is more important than an imaginary solution to \"gridlock\" in the privileging of cars.\n"

        "comment": "This is a terrible proposal that will not affect traffic congestion. By making the ride wider and getting rid of these bike lanes you will just incentivize more people to drive, clogging up said lanes.\nI personally use these lanes weekly and by removing them you are just going to force people like to me to take a whole lane and clog up traffic even more. If Ford cared at all about reducing commute time and not just pleasing his suburban voters he would invest in more alternate transportation methods like bike lanes and further funding into transit.\nThis is a obviously just a political move, so I doubt anyone will even read these. Just know this well very likely cause more cycling accidents and deaths, something that will be entirely on Ford's hands.\n"

I see the difference that putting in bike lanes has made -- the number of cyclists on the road during my daily commute has increased 100-fold. I bike year-round and others do too because the snow in Toronto doesn't stay on the roads long . I can't believe the provincial government is considering removing infrastructure that protects those using a mode of transportation that *removes cars from the road*. I am a year-round cyclist but I also own and drive a car (mostly on weekends, when I occasionally pay to use the 407!). I am appalled at the complete disregard for the safety of cyclists. PLEASE DO NOT MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS PROPOSAL.\n"

Let alone the health benefits to lessen the burden on our healthcare system. We should be encouraging families to bike so that the young kids grow up with fitness as a part of their day instead of video games. Lack of activity leads to obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular issues etc. The percentage of cyclists is small because there aren't alot of safe routes, it is proven in European countries that the more bike lanes that are built the more cyclists there will be. Ottawa is proof of that as well.\n"
