        "comment": "Bill 212's shortsightedness is matched only by it's ignorance to the factors that truly effect traffic congestion. Tearing out bike lanes which allow for mobility in a dense urban environment without the use of a car will only serve to reinforce the necessity of car ownership, serve to increase the mode share of cars, lead to increased deaths of vulnerable road users, and ultimately increase the amount of traffic in a city. Furthermore, using bikes as a wedge issue to drive through a bill that includes the ability to build a new highway through protected Greenbelt land without requiring an environmental assessment of the damage that will be caused is callous and cynical. If this government had any real interest in reducing traffic congestion, they would be focusing on improving transit frequency, connectivity, and reliability throughout the province, and on supporting alternatives to driving within cities, as the only way to reduce traffic congestion is to reduce the number of trips made by car.\n"

        "comment": "I was born and have always lived in Bloor West Village. It is a neighbourhood of families, many with strollers, and older people like myself. I walk and shop on Bloor Street, take public transportation -  especially when going downtown - and ride my bike to get to other cycle paths. Now I stroll my grandson on Bloor Street. In these last few years one of my neighbours was hit by a car on Bloor Street at South Kingsway. With the installation of the bike path they have made this corner safer by making Mossom Road one way with no access from Bloor going west. Most drivers are pleasant and cautious of pedestrians and cyclists as they get used to the changes. I believe we need to move forward with bike paths and fewer cars to keep not just cyclists but also pedestrians safe, and also healthy as we cycle and walk! Bloor West has always been a busy shopping street, as is The Kingsway, and there were always cars parked which meant just one lane of traffic, so the bike lanes are not the problem. There is still parking with the bike lanes so parking was not taken away. More people live here now as we have 3 condos at South Kingsway, with at least two more going up, and most don't have enough parking spots. So those new residents will need safe walking streets, bike paths and good public transportation to travel from home. We need to give everyone time to understand how the roads and bike paths work! It is ridiculous to spend the time and money to build this path and then spend twice as much money to remove them. Finally, we live in a democracy and the communities were invited to meetings where decisions were made. Let's allow our democracy to work. As a parent, grandparent and retired teacher I do not want to tell my grandson and our young people that the bullies and their loud voices (and money?) win. Let's get Toronto walking, cycling and taking public transportation to have the Toronto we voted for and want!\n"

Not only that, but we've developed the EA process for a reason - to reduce risk to the natural environment, our waterways and farmland. Creating a Bill under the guise of bike lanes and then working legislation into the Bill that would allow the government to skip an EA for Highway 413 is not only deceitful but overall just wrong.\nStop Bill 212.\n"

        "comment": "I am very opposed to this proposal.   The provincial government should stay out of municipal decisions of this sort; otherwise it is impossible to put any faith in the planning process in Ontario.  The bike lanes on Bloor will in the end prove to be a benefit.  Once all the development slated to happen around the new Bloor Dundas interchange is completed, the traffic will be as congested with 4 lanes as it is now with 2 unless Toronto designs the west end to encourage pedestrian and bicycle activity.  In my experience the traffic is bad only twice/day and the parking behind Bloor is usually plentiful if people aren't too lazy to look for it.  What is desperately needed in this part of town is a human-centred plan for the Kingsway section of Bloor, something that the city of Toronto is trying to do.   Dundas St provides lots of east-west vehicle capacity now that the construction near Scarlett is completed - drivers should move off Bloor and onto Dundas which has zero potential as a pedestrian-friendly community.  With proper planning , laneway deliveries and accessible drop-off could be provided for both north and south sides of Bloor.\n      While I am addressing Bloor St, the same applies province-wide.  Municipalities should not be puppets of the province to be over-ruled when our overly intrusive premier feels the urge.  My comments are based on my own observations as a resident of an affected area.\n"

        "comment": "Parts of the Bloor have bike lanes (ie west of south kingsway) that are under utilized.  I take that road in the evenings (during rush hour) a few times a week.  It's frustrating to sit in traffic - single file, while the bike lanes sit unused.  Over the course of a year - I've only seen 6 bicyclers (in total) use these lanes at the time when I'm driving by - it seems like this decision was made in favour of few, at the expense of many.  I'm glad the government is willing to reconsider removing these lanes in favour of what's better for the communities they exist in.\n"

        "comment": "I have lived in Toronto my entire life, and have used all forms of transportation in this city, from buses to bikes to cars to trains. The bike lanes added on Bloor St. in 2016 significantly improved my commute, making me feel safer and more able to get around the city than ever before, and also immediately increased the amount I went outside and exercised. When I moved out to the east end in 2018, the difference in road safety while biking from Bloor to Danforth became even more stark, and I was greatly relieved by the city's decision to extend the bike lanes further east in 2020.\nThe only difference I ever noticed with regards to traffic was that I was now less afraid of getting doored by cars stopped in the parking lane, which had always limited the flow of traffic along these roads anyways. Indeed, studies by the city regarding the impact of the Danforth bike lanes have shown that they had almost no impact on travel times, while providing numerous benefits (see supporting link #1). Across the city, the currently-existing bike lanes cover routes that are already heavily serviced by public transportation, so there has never been a need for them to support a high vehicle traffic volume, and the increased cycling infrastructure has been proven to have promoted increased business patronage and economic activity in these areas (see supporting link #2). Finally, countless studies have shown short-sighted plans such as the one suggested in Bill-212 to simply \"add more lanes\" for cars do not reduce congestion in the long run, even leaving aside their impact on cyclists (see supporting link #3).\nI am appalled by the province's overreach in proposing this bill, which is a blatant attempt to interfere with city affairs that are well outside its mandate. If Doug Ford would like to improve traffic conditions across a more appropriate scope, I might recommend supporting expansions of inter-city public transportation across the GTA and especially along the Highway 401 corridor (a policy that actually does have evidence to support it; see supporting link #4). I am also concerned about the fact that, if passed, Bill 212 will exempt the planned Highway 413 project from needing to complete its full provincial environmental assessment before beginning construction, despite being located in one of Ontario's most environmentally-sensitive areas.\nIn summary, I strongly encourage the Premier and his party to rescind this bill in the interest of public safety, environmental responsibility, and long-term benefit to all GTA residents.\n"

It empowers people who do not have access to a car. By implementing bike lanes, we are supporting healthier ways of living.\nBill 212 is an absolute provincial overreach impacting Toronto\u2019s infrastructure management.\nAs a resident of Toronto, I am deeply concerned about the implications of Bill 23 and the proposed Bill 212. The significant reduction in our city\u2019s infrastructure budget due to Bill 23 has already strained our ability to maintain and improve essential services. The additional measures proposed in Bill 212 threaten to further disrupt our city\u2019s carefully balanced infrastructure planning, which is crucial for addressing street space allocation, climate action, affordability, road safety, and overall quality of life.\nI believe that the City of Toronto, with its unique needs and challenges, is best positioned to manage its own infrastructure. The proposed section 195.2 of the Highway Traffic Act represents an overreach that undermines local governance and the ability of our elected officials to serve the interests of their constituents effectively.\nIt is essential that the Province respects the jurisdiction of municipalities to manage their own infrastructure and address the competing demands of their residents.\n"

        "comment": "Ontario's Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, which aims to improve transportation infrastructure and reduce traffic congestion, is a proposal that may sound promising on the surface, but upon closer examination, it reveals several flaws that could worsen the problem it seeks to address and ultimately lead to long-term negative consequences.\n1. Overemphasis on Expanding Road Infrastructure\nOne of the central components of the Act is the expansion of road networks and highways to alleviate gridlock. While this may seem like a direct solution to traffic problems, it fails to account for the well-established phenomenon of induced demand. This concept suggests that simply building more roads encourages more people to drive, which can actually increase congestion in the long run. Rather than reducing gridlock, expanding infrastructure often leads to even worse traffic as more vehicles take advantage of the newly constructed lanes, quickly filling them up. This cycle of endless road expansion is not a sustainable solution and could ultimately lead to a \u201cbigger is worse\u201d situation.\n2. Environmental Impact and Urban Sprawl\nThe Act\u2019s focus on road-building and expanding highways also overlooks the environmental consequences of such projects. More roads lead to greater carbon emissions, which is a direct contradiction to Ontario\u2019s climate goals. The construction and maintenance of highways require significant energy and materials, and increased car usage contributes to air pollution and worsens the province's carbon footprint. Additionally, expanding highways encourages urban sprawl, as more land is developed for new housing, businesses, and industries along major roadways. This sprawl can diminish green spaces, harm ecosystems, and increase the pressure on municipal services in new suburban areas.\n3. Neglecting Public Transit and Active Transportation\nThe Act\u2019s focus on roads and highways overlooks the crucial role of public transportation and active transportation (e.g., walking and cycling) in solving gridlock. For Ontario to truly reduce traffic congestion and improve quality of life, the government needs to prioritize investments in transit systems, such as buses, subways, and commuter trains. Expanding these systems would provide Ontarians with viable alternatives to driving, reducing the overall number of vehicles on the road. The Act should also place a stronger emphasis on creating safe cycling lanes and pedestrian pathways to encourage active modes of transport. By neglecting these areas, the government is not addressing the underlying need for sustainable transportation solutions.\n4. Lack of Focus on Congestion Pricing and Demand Management\nInstead of simply building more roads, Ontario should explore solutions that manage traffic demand. Measures like congestion pricing, which charges vehicles to enter high-traffic areas during peak hours, have proven effective in cities around the world, such as London and New York. The Act misses this opportunity to implement more sophisticated strategies to reduce congestion in a way that encourages people to take public transit or adjust their travel habits. Without addressing demand management, the province risks continuing to support a car-dependent culture, which exacerbates gridlock rather than alleviating it.\n5. Impact on Local Communities and Quality of Life\nThe expansion of highways and road networks under this Act could have detrimental effects on local communities. New roads often pass through residential neighborhoods, leading to increased noise, pollution, and the disruption of local businesses. These communities may find themselves trapped between expanding highways and deteriorating environmental conditions, ultimately reducing their quality of life. Additionally, road expansion can lead to displacement of existing residents, particularly in underprivileged areas, who may be forced to relocate due to construction projects or gentrification driven by increased access to transportation corridors.\n6. Missed Opportunity for Innovative Solutions\nInstead of continuing with outdated and car-centric solutions, the Ontario government should be looking for more innovative transportation alternatives. This could include increasing investment in shared mobility services like carpooling, ride-hailing, and autonomous vehicles. There is also potential to integrate smart traffic management systems that can reduce congestion by optimizing traffic flow. These technologies are not given enough attention in the Act, which suggests the government is still focused on old models of transportation infrastructure that may no longer be the most effective in addressing modern challenges.\nConclusion\nWhile the Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act proposes a solution to Ontario's traffic problems, its heavy reliance on expanding road infrastructure and neglect of alternative transportation options are shortsighted and ineffective in the long run. The government\u2019s focus on road construction is likely to exacerbate traffic congestion, contribute to environmental degradation, and encourage urban sprawl. To truly solve Ontario's gridlock issues, the government should prioritize sustainable transportation solutions, such as investing in public transit, improving active transportation infrastructure, and adopting congestion pricing and demand management strategies. Without these measures, the Act risks perpetuating the very problems it intends to resolve.\n"

As a cyclist, having these lanes provides some level of safety from the growing number of anti-cyclist motorists. The removal will place lives in jeopardy. All for what? How much time will be saved?

The bike lines make traffic worse - not only reducing productive work hours but interfere with emergency vehicle response. Bike lanes should not be on major routes - especially University near hospitals. The use of these lanes in many locations on bad weather days is almost nil. I support cycling and bike paths but not everywhere. I do suggest the bike path along the waterfront should be widened however - there is room.  Also the bike lane design needs to be better thought out. Both sides of the streets is unnecessary in low traffic areas. There is much wasted space on the road. They are also ugly with the white reflectors. Speed limits should be enforced for bikes. Bikes should be licensed and helmets mandatory. As our population ages bikes are not realistic. Many people are not physically able to use bikes. Just like High Park - our City should represent all residents - not just those they agree with. The car is not the enemy to many with mobility issues. Be a City for all not just for your pet projects.\n"
