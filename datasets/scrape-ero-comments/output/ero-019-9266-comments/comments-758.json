        "comment": "Thank you for this opportunity to comment. I live in Toronto and cycling is my primary mode of transport around the city. I cycle to and from work everyday I am in the office, typically 4 days per week. I also cycle to virtually all other activities, including medical appointments and social events.\nSafety\nI rely on the city bike lanes, including the lanes proposed for removal on Bloor St, Yonge St and University Ave. I am extremely concerned that the removal of these bike lanes will seriously jeopardize the safety of all cyclists in the city.\nOn August 31, 2024 my wife was struck by a car in a hit and run while biking on a street without a bike lane. She was nearly killed and spent four days in the trauma ward at St. Michael\u2019s Hospital. This hit and run was reported in the news: https://toronto.citynews.ca/2024/08/31/police-search-for-hit-and-run-dr\u2026\nThis awful experience reiterated the need for more bike lanes in Toronto, not less. Many cyclists, myself included, do not feel safe cycling on roads without bike lanes. These bike lanes protect the safety of all cyclists in Toronto and should not be removed.\nBenefits of Cycling\nCycling offers numerous benefits. It provides exercise and boosts physical and mental wellbeing, which benefits our economy by increasing productivity and decreasing healthcare costs. It benefits the environment by reducing pollution. It is often the fastest way to travel, which again benefits the economy by reducing time wasted in traffic. Cycling is also by far the most affordable mode of transport available in the city. I exclusively use the BikeShare Toronto service. This costs me $120 per year or $10 per month. A monthly transit pass for the TTC costs $156 per month. A car is estimated to cost about $1300 per month. Using a bike is by far the most affordable option. Given the stratospheric cost of living in Toronto, many of us cannot afford anything else.\nBike lanes save time and money and should not be removed.\nThank you.\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nI am deeply concerned over this bill.\nIt should be called \"Bill 212, Reducing oversight, Saving government Time Act, 2024\"\nI hate hiding critical issues under the trojan horse of bike lanes to confuse the publix and media, it's very slimy.\nThe expropriation of land, lack of thorough environmental assessments, and overriding municipal power is not how we build bridges. That builds walls. Walls that divide and close the doors to consultation and compromise.\nThe highway plans are done to benefit wealthy property developers and back door deals Doug Ford made. Not the people.\nI vote to reject this bill as disingenuous hiding behind bike lanes. Split it off, have a real conversation with council about planning for growth.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes make the city safer, for car drivers and cyclists. I own a car, but frequently use the bike lanes to go downtown for errands, instead of looking for parking.  As a cyclist, I have had car drivers try to hit me when I've had to share the road with them, while I feel safe in bike lanes.\nFord is still punishing Toronto for not electing him mayor. It is transparent and sad.\nSetting aside the bike lanes, 413 is an environmental disaster in the making. Ford is enriching his friends at the expense of our land and progress, and all Ontarians will suffer for it.\n"

        "comment": "I am a driver, a cyclist, and a pedestrian. However I am travelling, bike lanes make my trip safer. As a driver, I want to know where other road users are. As a cyclist, I want to make it home to have dinner with my kids.\nThe idea of removing bike lanes is a preposterous waste of tax payer money and will ultimately lead to more congestion, not less.\nI'm struggling to even find words because the evidence is so overwhelmingly in support of the benefits of bike lanes to make our roads safer, increase physical activity, move more people faster, reduce air pollution and its impacts on our health, support local businesses by making it easier for travellers to stop in along the way, and yes, reduce road congestion.\nI urge you abandon Bill 212, which will not reduce gridlock and will only further waste Ontarians' time and money.\n"

        "comment": "To whom it may concern,\nI oppose Ontario Bill 212 (Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024) for several key reasons. The idea of removing bike lanes to reduce traffic congestion is flawed and lacks supporting evidence. In reality, eliminating bike lanes won\u2019t ease traffic; research and past data show the opposite. This policy could increase accidents and fatalities, leading to higher costs for the city in healthcare, emergency services, and legal expenses.\nData from Toronto illustrates this issue. When bike lanes were removed from Jarvis Street in 2011, the city\u2019s own records showed that travel times grew longer and traffic became slower, contradicting the goal of reducing congestion. Removing bike lanes only puts cyclists at risk and discourages eco-friendly transportation, which increases car dependence and worsens gridlock.\nRather than implementing policies that jeopardize public safety and undermine urban infrastructure, the province should prioritize investments that directly improve the well-being of residents, such as healthcare and education. This would be a far more beneficial approach for Ontarians in the long run than removing bike lanes to cater to drivers and suburban commuters.\nUltimately, Bill 212 represents a setback for both Toronto and the province. Sustainable urban planning should focus on multimodal transportation that ensures safety, efficiency, and environmental sustainability. The government should prioritize building a livable and accessible city for all, not just for those who commute by car.\nBest regards,\nAn Ontarian who walks, bikes, and drives\n"

        "comment": "I have serious questions and concerns about the proposed removal of bike lanes. I've attached an article that goes dispells and unpacks some of the assumed improvements of increased motor traffic lanes better than I can. What I do want to note as someone who both cycles and drives in Toronto is that these bike lanes are imperative for the safety of cyclists. I have been car doored and seriously injured having been forced to cycle in significant areas without dedicated lanes because of careless drivers. The removal of bike lanes in addition to likely not improving traffic and wasting funds that could go into social or other economic programs also makes the city less safer to cyclists.\n"

As a driver, car owner and  a cyclist I deeply deeply wish for this city to join the 20th century and embrace the bike lanes. This premier has a beef with the city and he\u2019s doing things to hurt our children- shame on him and anyone who supports him. Toronto needs bike lanes!\n"

        "comment": "Comments applicable to removal of bike lanes in Toronto; interference in local jurisdiction's ability to build complete streets; building of Highway 413.\nLAND USE\nCar dependent suburbs constitute urban sprawl. The massive amount of space in the suburbs devoted to moving cars around and parking them is an insanely short-sighted waste of valuable land. Movement of substantial numbers of people by efficient, attractive public transportation is essential. Free up road space for use by necessary vehicles by providing alternatives. Correct the 20thC North American bias against transit and cycling as second-class options - it is killing us.\nPOLLUTION\nVehicle emissions are a major contributor to air pollution . Research has demonstrated increased adverse health consequences for people living near highways and arterial roads (https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/publications/healthy-li\u2026) EVs would reduce some of this, eventually, but particulate matter from tire and brake wear is also significant. For reasons relating to health, both individually and as an expense borne by society, the province should be protecting the personal safety of vulnerable road users including cyclists and those using mobility devices, and facilitating infrastructure that promotes healthy ways of life and urban development that permits active transportation.\nHEALTH\nProvincial bodies have endorsed Vision Zero (eg Ontario Traffic Council) - why does the province itself value movement of vehicles over the safety and health of Ontarians?\nBicycles are a quick, efficient and cheap way to get around the city. Cars are expensive, take up a lot of space and lead to stress and a sedentary life. Why discourage bikes and encourage cars?\nRED TAPE\nThere is a discrepancy between the province's stated objective of reducing red tape and their proposed expensive and time consuming bureaucratic interference in matters of local jurisdiction over the building of complete streets.\nToronto in the 20thC widened roads at the expense of pedestrian infrastructure and green space. Now the province is proposing to widen roads by removing bicycle infrastructure. The result will be what it has always been, more cars on the road until a pain point is reached. In the process many lives will be endangered, many people forced into cars or onto already crowded and inadequate transit. The people of Ontario will be the losers.\nThank you for this opportunity to submit comments.\n"

We are at a time of crisis due to global climate change. The negative effects of driving are cumulative, and every motor vehicle trip not taken helps. Please keep the bike lanes open, build more, and protect the safety of cyclists who are trying their best not to get killed as they do their part on climate change.\n"

Aside from the obvious bike lanes being a massive step back in the efforts to fight climate change and improve transit (many studies with regard to induced demand show how stupid this bill is), there are several highly questionable clauses with regard to environmental protections and regulations that need to be removed completely from this act.\nNO TO BILL 212\n"

It\u2019s safe for families and people we are new to cycling in the city. It\u2019s much fast than public transit and driving. As a driver I feel it\u2019s easier to move around with the dedicated bike lanes. Less irrational bikers who don\u2019t stay in one place.\n"

        "comment": "My husband and I recently moved to Ottawa because of the bike lane system. After living in Europe and being able to cycle and walk everywhere with many city center cores not allowing cars, we believe that cycling is a vital part of our lifestyle.\nThe bike lanes were central to our decision because:\n1. they are necessary to safeguard my life (I was already hit once in traffic without lanes because there was no barrier to protect me).\n2. Larger roads invite MORE cars and create more traffic, degrading the center city experience.\n3. Sustainability is a crucial concern of mine; we must dramatically reduce carbon emissions, and cyclists do not create carbon emissions.\n4. Obesity is a growing pandemic; the more we can encourage people to cycle, the more we fight obesity. People are scared to cycle next to cars; add bike lanes, and more people cycle; they are healthier and make fewer demands on our health care services.\n5. Let Ottawa and other municipalities decide for themselves. Capitals around the world are competing for tourist dollars; people love to cycle on vacation; it feels like an adventure. Each city has unique needs. Let us decide for ourselves.\n6. The bike lanes are in place; removing them wastes taxpayers' money.\n7. Local shops will suffer; if I cannot bike to them, I won't go.\n8. E-bikes are changing the face of transportation. Without bike lanes, they will be on the roads; people have invested a fortune in these bikes and will continue using them. It will be unsafe for cyclists and drivers alike.\n9. Cycling is fun and free. With all the economic pressures we face, let people use cycling to save money.  It needs to be safe.\n10. We have a mental health crisis, cycling supports mental health, being outdoor, joining others, feeling connected rather than isolated in our cars, we need more not fewer bike lanes.\nThis issue is very important to me. It will decide how I vote.\nThank you.\n"

All the millions of dollars it would take to remove the already amazing ability to safely bike through the city and and increasing  quality of life for so many people,  should be put towards a much better use, like say, the care health system, education, childcare! Come on, what a complete waste of resources this would be, I\u2019m shocked it\u2019s even been put forward!!!\n"
