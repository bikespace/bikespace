The more car lanes we have, the more people drive, thus creating more traffic. Traffic means wasted time, wasted money, and has a negative impact on the environment. Look at one of the spots in Ontario with the worst traffic, the 401. It is over 20 lanes wide in some places, not a bike lane in sight, yet it has terrible terrible traffic.\nI would know, I drive on it 5 days a week!\nI implore the premier of our great province to think about making our transportation system more efficient, economically viable, and environmentally friendly.\nThink of the future generations who are going to have to deal with the environmental and economic fallout of digging deeper into a world revolving entirely around the car.\nThink of the people who cannot afford a car but still need to get around.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal will bring Ontario backwards.\nReducing infrastructure that allows for safe travel on a bike will hurt those who rely on this method of travel. It also goes against much of the supporting evidence of the benefits of biking (recreation and transport) for the individual and their community.\nThis proposal will not significant effect the \"gridlock\" and traffic concerns in a meaningful way. However- it will increase safety risks for cyclists, it will reduce to accessibility for those who are looking for a more sustainable way of travel and it will send a clear message that the province does not value this community.\nBiking reduces the volume of vehicles on the road, it promotes community, connection, health and much more. By attacking a portion of the population that are contributing to our communities you are setting a large portion of the population above them.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes contribute to inclusive and well-rounded communities by offering people convenient and equitable transportation options to meet their daily needs. As a Registered Professional Planner, bike lanes provide people with options, improve public health and safety, support economic activity, foster social interaction and community connectivity, improve air quality and mitigate climate change\nimpacts.\nThe proposed legislative changes will not alleviate congestion, but will heighten public safety risks, and deviate from evidence-based practices. Additionally, these changes contradict the 2024 Provincial Planning Statement, which includes several policies that advocate for the use of bike lanes.\nCongestion, particularly in the GTHA, is at an unprecedented level, and there is a general agreement that measures must be taken to reduce traffic while acknowledging the limitations of available roadway space. That being said, when I did live in Toronto I only travelled by bike and public transit, despite having a car. Cycling in the City was a healthy and a more time/cost-effecient mode of transporation. The Province's focus should be to develop roadways that ensure safety for all users and offer multiple transportation options, including walking, cycling, public transit, and driving.\nI also believe the Province should avoid evaluating bike lane infrastructure for all of Ontario solely through the perspective of the GTHA. Similar to the PPS 2024 (which is now GTHA-centric), this approach reflects a narrow view of development across the Province. In my experience with planning in Windsor, there are numerous underutilized roadways that would be ideal for cycling infrastructure. Implementing this additional layer of regulation will further hinder an already slow-moving process.\n"

When we propritize the most expensive, least space efficient mode of transit, driving, then we are prioritizing an increase of car traffic. How many expensive new highways and road widenings must be done with accompanying increases in car traffic before our province realizes that it is only making car traffic worse. Invest in public transit for longer trips and trips between cities and bicycle infrastructure within cities. Restricting cheap bike lanes and wasting billions of dollars on expensive highways that will fill up within a couple years are bankrupting our province.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose Bill 212, Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act. Limiting bike lanes in this way is a step backward for urban mobility - not only in the City but for the province as a whole. As both a cyclist and a motorist, I understand the importance of effective congestion relief policies. However, restricting bike lanes completely misses the mark given the body of literature and case studies of cities who have effectively managed congestion.\nEvidence suggests that bike lanes often reduce traffic by providing safe alternatives for trips that might otherwise require a car. The body of research on cycling and bike lanes show that separated lanes improve traffic flow, while offering a safe, cheap, accessible, and sustainable alternative to using a car for many people (thus reducing the number of cars on the road, doubly reducing congestion).  See for example,\nDuranton, G., & Turner, M. A. (2011). The fundamental law of road congestion: Evidence from US cities. American Economic Review, 101(6), 2616\u20132652. This highly influential paper presents the \"fundamental law of road congestion,\" which argues that increases in road capacity generally lead to proportional increases in vehicle traffic, negating congestion relief. The findings underscore the need for alternatives to car-centric congestion solutions, supporting investments in multimodal infrastructure like bike lanes.\nPucher, J., Dill, J., & Handy, S. (2010). Infrastructure, programs, and policies to increase bicycling: An international review. Preventive Medicine, 50(S1), S106-S125. This review synthesizes studies from multiple countries, this paper is often referenced for the insights into how dedicated bike infrastructure can shift travel behavior away from cars, which has been shown to alleviate congestion in urban settings.\nBuehler, R., & Pucher, J. (2012). Cycling to work in 90 large American cities: New evidence on the role of bike paths and lanes. Transportation, 39(2), 409-432. This paper presents empirical evidence that the presence of bike lanes and paths correlates with higher cycling rates and lower car dependency in large American cities. The study argues that bike lanes can reduce traffic congestion by enabling more residents to cycle, especially for short trips that might otherwise be taken by car.\nJacobsen, P. L. (2003). Safety in numbers: More walkers and bicyclists, safer walking and bicycling. Injury Prevention, 9(3), 205-209. While focused on safety, Jacobsen\u2019s research is seminal in showing that increased numbers of cyclists and pedestrians make cities safer and more navigable for all users, leading to potential reductions in car use and urban congestion as cities become more bike-friendly.\nMarshall, W. E., & Ferenchak, N. N. (2019). Why cities with high bicycling rates are safer for all road users. Journal of Transport & Health, 13, 100539. This study offers insights into the \u201csafety in numbers\u201d effect and argues that cities with high cycling rates experience reduced traffic conflicts and improved overall flow. It has become foundational for advocating dedicated cycling infrastructure as part of a strategy to improve urban mobility and reduce congestion.\nBuehler, R., & Pucher, J. (2012). Cycling to work in 90 large American cities: New evidence on the role of bike paths and lanes. Transportation, 39(2), 409-432. This study analyzed the impact of bike infrastructure on traffic flow, finding that cities with dedicated bike lanes and paths experienced increased cycling and reduced automobile traffic.\nThis bill would not only halt progress but lead to the wasteful removal of functioning infrastructure\u2014an inefficient use of taxpayer money. Instead of promoting regressive policies, we should be investing in modern, multimodal transportation that benefits all road users.\nOntario\u2019s cities need forward-looking policies that recognize cycling as a key element of urban transit. Please reconsider Bill 212 as written and support sustainable, evidence-based transportation planning and policies instead.\n"

This is infrastructure that saves lives and saves the environment. The network of bike lanes in my city is one of the things I love the most about it and that makes me proudest and happiest to live here. I can't even fathom having these beloved and well-used bike lanes removed in favour of more car lanes. This proposal is on par with the historic removal of Ottawa's street car system - it feels like a short-sighted move in the wrong direction, and one that we would end up deeply regretting. Everyone -- even car drivers -- will benefit if we make it easier and safer for people to choose to bike.\n"

Time and again research shows that additional space for cars \u2013 with new roads or new lanes on existing roads \u2013 results in more cars, NOT fewer.\nThe provincial government should work with municipal governments to improve public transportation (local and regional) and support their efforts to provide safe active transportation options.

        "comment": "This proposal is significant government overreach. Decades of consultations from residents, businesses, and road users have been studied extensively- Bloor St more than any other bike lane in the history of North America. Removing bike lanes and requiring provincial approval for new bike lanes will do nothing to solve traffic congestion and will put people\u2019s lives in danger. Most drivers prefer separated space between drivers and cyclists. If you want to curb traffic congestion, expedite transit projects and ensure people have alternatives to driving so that those who have to drive have fewer cars in front of them on the road. There is countless data and evidence that shows how induced demand works. The criteria for removing bike lanes should be transparent and evidence based. Cycling numbers are much higher than the Minister is quoting in urban downtown areas. The Government needs to back down on this one or commuting is going to get worse for every mode of transportation, driving included. People will still bike, but they will take the lane and make it worse for drivers. And there will be deaths and serious injuries that this government will have to be accountable for.\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nAs both a motorist and cyclist in Ottawa, Ontario, I oppose Ontario's proposed Bill 212 - Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024, particularly the requirement for the province to review municipal projects that involve bike lanes necessitating the removal of traffic lanes. This provision undermines local efforts to create safer, more accessible biking infrastructure and appears to prioritize the feelings of motorists over the needs of cyclists and pedestrians. By interfering in this way, the province is sending a message that it does not value sustainable transportation options. We should be promoting, not hindering, the development of bike lanes that contribute to a healthier, more efficient transportation system. I urge lawmakers to reconsider this approach and support initiatives that encourage cycling. Having more safe cycling infrastructure, with less barriers to implementation, could in fact promote people to get out of their cars and on to bicycles, thus reducing overall gridlock. I thought the Ford Government promised to \"cut red tape\", Bill 212 seems like adding a red brick wall that now needs to be surmounted.\n"

Reducing gridlock should not come at the expense of cyclist safety; in fact, it should be the other way around. We should be encouraging more cycles in the downtown core, not less.\nProtected bike lanes are crucial for promoting safe and sustainable transportation options, especially in our densely populated areas. They contribute to reducing traffic congestion, lowering greenhouse gas emissions, and enhancing public health. Removing these lanes would not only endanger cyclists but would also undermine our efforts to create a more accessible and vibrant community.\nTo further alleviate congestion, I urge the adoption of a congestion charge for vehicles in the already congested downtown core, similar to what has been successfully implemented in London, UK. This approach helps keep central areas moving efficiently while encouraging the use of alternative modes of transportation.\nPlease reconsider the implications of this bill on cyclist safety and the broader community. We need to protect our bike lanes and promote a safer, more sustainable future for everyone.\nThank you for your attention to this important matter.\n"

        "comment": "This is a ridiculous intrusion on the planning needs of municipalities. Municipalities need to make the choices best suited to their regions, and this imposes needless red tape to what is inherently a local matter.\nThere are additional metrics of importance to a municipality beyond just traffic. Improving foot traffic to local businesses does not always require four lanes of traffic and two additional lanes of parallel parking. Slowing down traffic, narrowing streets, and providing wider sidewalks and separated bike lanes can improve the walkability of a neighbourhood and encourage local shopping. This may be at odds with the current goals of the provincial government, but that is the choice that the municipality is best positioned to decide.\nBuilding a community and providing for that community is what municipalities are great at, and the provincial government needs to stay in their lane and focus on providing better services for which they are responsible for, such as improving our education and health systems.\n"

Let's look a the transit plans - the provincial government created the city's congestion from backlog of the Eglinton LRT and who knows when with the Ontario Line. The province should focus on getting these transit upgrades quicker - it's an embarrassment compared to other global cities.\nI am a pedestrian, cyclist, transit user and driver - so I am for finding a sustainable solution and working together. There are many examples around the world where all modes of transportation can coexist. Doug Ford needs to stop listening to his privileged neighbours problems and focus on the things he cannot deliver.\nThe removal of bike lanes to reduce gridlock in a city is not a solution, instead this will create more congestion and negatively impact the safety of everyone, here are my concerns:\n1. Congestion and Safety: Removing bike lanes in busy areas will likely worsen congestion and increase cyclists accidents. The removal of bike lanes will not behavioural patterns as cyclist will continue to ride beside cars. We've seen enough cycling accidents downtown Toronto so far this year - we need to find better solutions to co-exist. Cities like Montreal show bikes and cars can coexist without heavy-handed interventions. A balanced approach can promote bike safety without sacrificing street functionality.\n2. Efficiency of Biking: Biking is faster than transit or driving for many. You want to reduce gridlock then focus on improving transit so people would actually use it.\n3. Provincial Overreach: Municipalities know their streets best. This proposal disregards local governance and misaligns with the city's unique needs.\n4. Conflicts with climate action strategy.\n"

So, I am very thankful that the Province has stepped in to provide a rational path forward.\nA: NEGLIGIBLE USE - MISUSE OF CITY FUNDS:\n*100% pay, * less than 1% of population use and *50% of infrastructure is dedicated to them?\nThe bike lanes in Etobicoke as well as those on Scarlett Road experience next to no use annually. I have never seen a cyclist on the ones on Scarlett Road.  I am on those roads daily.\nMeanwhile, people can\u2019t get to their jobs, pick up kids, drop off a parent, to an appointment, etc..\nB: SENIORS and MOBILITY ISSUES\nMy mother with health ailments needed to visit a specialist across the City.  She can not take the TTC, she can not ride a bike.   She needs to drive there.  She recently spent 2.5 hours trying to get across the City only to eventually give up and miss her appointment - and because she missed this appointment she was cast out of the clinic.  This idea that we can all just bike from Etobicoke to Scarborough and all will be well, is impossible.\nC: TRADES\nOur province and country relies on trades for our economy and to build badly needed houses.  My tiler, My mason, My electrician, My framer, my roofer and the guys who deliver their products, etc, etc\u2026 are not gonna arrive by bike.\nD: INCREASED IDLING, INCREASED POLLUTION\nThe bike lanes in Etobicoke have vastly increased idling time as cars just sit everywhere while essentially no one is in the bike lane..\nE: DANGEROUS LAYOUT ON BLOOR\nThere are now endless hidden driveways for cars to try to navigate turns as cars/SUVs, etc in the island parking obscure if there is a cyclist there. Sometimes, if there happens to be a cyclist, they are on an e-bike going extremely fast, it is very dangerous.  * Perhaps the Province could amend the guide to installing such bike lanes as it is a Provincial document?\nF: HOUSING CRISIS AND LANE USE\nThere are multiple condos which need to go up in Etobicoke which will require access to the job site.  The bike lanes have made this access more difficult and more expense to manage.  People who build homes need to be helped, not hindered.\nG: CRISIS EVACUATION OF CITY\nAt present, if there is an accident on the Gardner, or maybe it is closed for some reason, or if there is a subway closure, then the East West street routes can not handle the overflow.  It is complete disaster with traffic and buses - but essentially NO cyclists.  An example was the flooding in July 2024 - the subway is closed, it is pouring rain, and people can not get anywhere.  Therefore, how in a case like a New York City 9-11 evacuation, could a City like Toronto manage? It would be a impossible.  We do not need a study on this... it is evident that there is a serious problem with each closure.\nH: BUSINESS DELIVERIES IMPAIRED\nIn the early morning on Bloor, large trucks need to deliver goods to businesses, they used to be able to park briefly in the right hand lane, but they can no longer do this because of the bike lanes. (I have seen a very large truck parked on Bloor at Grenview in the Bike lanes ) So businesses are having trouble obtaining their goods.\nI: SAFETY ARGUMENT\nThere needs to be a limit on how far a City must go to achieve safety of residents in allowed tasks.  Technically I can go for a walk in a park at night with the coyotes and whomever else is down there\u2026. But should I?  Should the City build a whole illuminated path for me and have rangers get the coyotes, or should I simply make the decision not to go?\nIt is possible, that although a cyclist can legally ride on any City road, maybe they should not?\nAlso a casual bike ride, or uber eats does not supersede the other needs of the City and its residents.\nJ: TTC less of AN ALTERNATIVE\nThe City is not making sufficient efforts to ensure the TTC is safe, clean and useable.  I personally know people who have been (during the day) threatened at knife point, vomited on by homeless,  been subject to many many indecent exposures, verbally assaulted, and the list goes on - and this is just the people I know in the last year.  As a result of these risks, more people, particularly women are choosing to drive.  And a bike is not an option for everyone, certainly not in bad weather and certainly not late at night.  Given the % of Torontians that use the TTC, any extra funds should be spent here, not on bike lanes.\nK: BIKE.. E-BIKE.  SCOOTER:  LICENSING AND INSURANCE\nIf e-bikes, and scooters etc are going super fast in the bike lanes, and they hit a senior or family attempting to exit their car after parking in the island parking - what is the recourse?  They are going faster than cars, you can\u2019t see them?  An e-bike is very heavy.\nL: PARKING DANGERS\nThe island parking on Bloor is dangerous - it is very difficult to exit your vehicle, and particularly with passengers, seniors, children, parcels\u2026 there is basically not enough space to exit safely and there used to be.\nM: EMERGENCY VEHICLES - IMPAIRED MOVEMENT\nI have witnessed many many emergency vehicles trapped in traffic on Bloor likely trying to save someone and they can not get by because of the cars.  They will likely not speak out because they are in part governed by the City - So I'm not surprised that their views are only collected through word of mouth.   This is unacceptable.  I am also told by doctor downtown in emerge that there are issues on University getting people to the hospitals.\nN: NO RIGHTS on RED, NO TURN lanes\nBecause there are no rights on Red in Etobicoke where there is a bike lane, this has drastically impacted traffic and congestion. But again, you just sit there with 'no' bikes.\nThank you,\nEtobicoke resident on Bloor daily\n"

Contrary of what many people believe, weather is not the main reason that stops people from using a bike to commute, it is safe infrastructure, there are many examples around the world where people commute by bike in bad weather, as long as they have safe cycling paths to do it.\nAnother argument I read against cycling lanes is that they do not belong in main roads, and that is very wrong. The main roads are the ones that have the shortest route to destinations, installing bike lanes in secondary roads would mean that people on bikes should have to ride more distance, expend more energy and complicate their route to get to their destinations, that is not fair and would not have the desire effect, to make cycling easier than driving a car.\nAnd I can't believe that people against bike lanes believe that stores located on roads with bike lanes will suffer from less transactions, on the contrary, people on bikes and on foot can stop in those stores more easily that people on cars, just by the fact that it is a lot less complicated for them to stop and shop around.\nIt is very sad and unbelievable to me that the province government is thinking about destroying all the good work that the city of Toronto is doing so far, this city is moving in the right direction, please keep it that way, I do not own a car, and I do not want to have to by one.\n"

Bicycles are an important part of urban mobility and will only create more traffic, injuries, and fatalities if the bike lanes are removed. Importantly, they keep traffic separated so that bicycles do not slow cars down and make it so that fewer people have to use cars to get around.\nFurther, there is no feasible amount of lanes that will get car traffic moving smoothly in Toronto. Rather, effort would be better directed to providing transit alternatives so that fewer people need to take cars to quickly get to their destinations which will leave the roads more empty for people who need to drive. Having one more lane open will not make a difference.\nAnd finally, these bike lanes have been approved through municipal processes and are right for the city and their location.
