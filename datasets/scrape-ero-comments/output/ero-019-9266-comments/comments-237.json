        "comment": "It's great the current Ontario Government wishes to review the traffic congestion GTA residents face every day.\nHowever, as we can learn from European Cities, building more roads or lanes won't solve gridlock. Providing viable alternatives to driving is the only way to solve it. Investing more in public transit and safe bicycle lanes are a few options.\nMany European cities don't have gridlock like the GTA, as they already have plenty of bike lanes and transit options. Biking is no longer just a sport like many years ago. It's a way of transportation for people to get from point A to B. It's also a great way to keep people healthy which reduces our health care cost.\nIf you remove the bike lanes, you are going you have more people killed on our streets, and Toronto's traffic woes will persist. I urge you to reconsider this regressive bill, and follow suit with other cities worldwide, that are all expanding their bike and transit networks.\n"

        "comment": "As someone who actually lives in a high-density urban environment, I can say from first-hand experience that adding bike lane infrastructure has made my life better and safer. I'm a frequent pedestrian, occasional cyclist, and occasional driver. In all these situations, I appreciate the presence of separated bike lanes. Even if bike lanes slowed city traffic \u2014\u00a0which they don't \u2014\u00a0I would still be in favor.\nThis government should not backpedal on the significant improvements that have been made to Toronto's street infrastructure in the last few years. The obvious underlying instinct at work with this proposal \u2014\u00a0removing existing bike lanes to appease a small number of frustrated drivers who don't actually live here \u2014\u00a0shouldn't be the basis for public policy. A few people's road rage doesn't make for good law.\nIf Queen's Park insists on tinkering with municipal affairs to improve the city's traffic situation, here are some alternative policies:\n- Automated speed cameras, to enforce the speed limit (something the police have evidently abandoned)\n- Automated red-light cameras, to penalize reckless driving that endangers pedestrians, cyclists, and other drivers\n- Automated Block-the-Box cameras, to discourage drivers from blocking cross-traffic in intersections (another neglected police duty)\n- Enforcing no-stopping zones (yet more police inaction), so the whole street doesn't grind to a halt for a single Uber or DoorDash driver with their four-way flashers on.\n- Expanding the no-parking hours on major thoroughfares. There are large segments of the day where Avenue Road, Mount Pleasant Road, Bathurst St, Lawrence Ave, Eglinton Ave, and more effectively lose the use of entire lanes in both directions because of a handful of (legally) parked cars.\n- More frequent and more reliable GO Train service, to make rail commuting viable for more users, from greater distances\n- A downtown congestion fee to incentivize more efficient use of city streets, and to pay for the other required improvements\nThe behaviour of drivers, not cyclists, has created Toronto's traffic problems; only changes to driver behaviour can fix them. I suggest you start there.\n"

It's bizarre and shows us the competence of the Ontario leadership is either sliping or was not there to begin with. Please reconsider as many people use these lanes to commute.\n"

It's worth noting that if a cyclist feels cars can not pass safely the advice is to take the entire lane... now THAT will hold things up\n"

        "comment": "Gridlock could be significantly improved if we invested in better public transit infrastructure, improved access to the exorbitantly costly 407 instead of building a separate highway (since we already paid for the 407 - I don\u2019t want my tax dollars being wasted on another highway I can\u2019t use), and increasing focus on cyclists\u2019 safety so more city dwellers use bikes instead of cars. We need fewer cars in downtown, not more. The mentality about car culture needs to change. Stop wasting our tax dollars.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed legislation that would require provincial approval for new municipal bike lanes in Ontario. This initiative is based on several misconceptions that overlook the vital role bike lanes play in creating safer, more efficient urban environments.\nFirst and foremost, the assumption that adding bike lanes contributes to traffic congestion is fundamentally flawed. In reality, the creation of a safe and connected cycling network encourages more people to leave their cars at home. When individuals feel secure biking on well-designed lanes, they are more likely to choose cycling over driving, thereby reducing the number of vehicles on the road and alleviating gridlock. Numerous studies have demonstrated that cities with robust cycling infrastructure experience less traffic congestion as a result of increased bike usage.\nMoreover, protected bike lanes significantly enhance safety for all road users. By clearly separating cyclists from motor vehicles, these lanes reduce conflicts and the potential for dangerous interactions, contributing to safer roads for pedestrians and drivers alike. A focus on safety is essential, and local municipalities are best positioned to understand and address the specific needs of their communities.\nIt is also critical to recognize that decisions regarding bike lanes should lie within the domain of municipalities, local voters and local road users. Municipal governments are more attuned to the unique characteristics and preferences of their communities. By centralizing the decision-making process at the provincial level, we risk undermining local governance and ignoring the voices of residents who are directly impacted by these changes.\nFinally, it is important to highlight the positive economic impact of bike lanes. Studies, including those conducted along corridors such as Bloor Street in Toronto, have shown that the introduction of bike lanes can lead to increased business activity. Cyclists are often more likely to stop and shop at local businesses, contributing to the vibrancy of our neighborhoods and supporting local economies.\nIn conclusion, I urge the provincial government to reconsider this proposed legislation. By empowering municipalities to make decisions about bike lanes, we can foster safer streets, reduce traffic congestion, and stimulate local economies. It is crucial that we prioritize the needs and voices of our communities in shaping a sustainable transportation future for Ontario. Thank you for considering my perspective.\n"

        "comment": "I am against this legislation. Preventing and removing bike lanes will not address congestion; cars create congestion. Active transportation options, such as cycling and walking, and public transit  are the solution to congestion (while also keeping people safe and healthy, reducing carbon emissions, increasing happiness, and saving people their hard earned money).\nI am not a cyclist but I fully support the existing bike lanes in Toronto (and elsewhere) and want more installed for all of the reasons stated above but most importantly because they save lives. I don\u2019t want to walk past anymore ghost bikes (memorials to cyclists who have been killed by careless drivers) in my neighbourhood. There are already far too many.\n"

        "comment": "Attacking bike lanes in a city (any city) in which downtown / core commuting times is a voter issue is outrageous. Cycling infrastructure and improvements in public transportation only serve to decrease congestion and this has been proven time and time again in every urban context imaginable. What we need to focus on is reducing traffic violations like speeding and aggressive driving, and making road work repairs more efficient so they reduce congestion. Bonus points for allocating certain paved areas bike only rather than shared with vehicle traffic, and let's please regulate e-bikes and scooters finally. Jesus.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bikes lanes is the complete opposite of what needs to be done. Cyclists should be subsized and paid by the provincial gov't for riding their bikes instead of taking up a lane on the road with their bikes. They're not even using the tax-funded public transit system, therefore saving the government even more money.\nIf Doug Ford has the spare cash laying around for $200 vote-buying cheques, and giving his MPPs $16,000 raises, and spending billions on the Thermes waterpark, and $40 billion for Highway 413, and the unlimited amount of money it would take to dig a tunnel under the 401, and giving away Greenbelt land, and shuttering the Science Centre, and $250 million to cancel Green Energy projects,and $250 million to Ford Motor Company executives just for saying that some time in the future they might build EVs in Ontario then there's plenty of money to give to cyclists as a reward for all the money and time they're saving everyone.\n"

Pre bike lanes car would stop along Bloor to quickly run into store essentially turning it into a single lane during rush hour. Presently everyone is safe with a bonus of parking available anytime. With the single lane drivers now need to be more engaged with driving and not stop in intersections and leave gaps for left turns.\nI believe that the bike lanes have a positive impact on the community. Keep them intact.\n"

        "comment": "Hi there, the province should not meddle in municipal matters like bike lanes. This proposal is obviously predatory overreach intended to rally support with motorists in the inner suburbs going into a provincial election. For shame. If the province proceeds to remove bike lanes in Toronto, it will absolutely kill vulnerable road users and prioritize inefficient, dangerous and polluting single occupant vehicles that already make Ontario municipalities less liveable by clogging up the streets. How about the province focuses on building transit, supporting transit oriented development and actually enforcing the Highway Traffic Act as motorists under this government have been allowed to flout it totally unchecked for years? Also, everyone in the city planning world is well aware that adding lanes for more cars just creates induced demand and does nothing to improve road congestion. Toronto needs better transit with transit priority signals and congestion pricing for motorists entering the city centre.\n"
