This is a blatant overreach by the Ontario PCC and will only cause increased traffic in areas without safe infrastructure for alternative modes of transportation. There are numerous numbers and statistics available to reference in regards to the benefits of bike lanes and encourage the province to reconsider.\n"

        "comment": "I moved back to Ontario (the province I was born in) in 2020 after living many years in Quebec. I was pleased to find out that London Ontario (the city I moved to) was installing bike lanes and improving their infrastructure. I do not own a car and my primary mode of transportation is bicycle throughout the year. There is a bike lane on my street and I have seen the volume of people using it grow significantly over the years, particularly as the price of gas has risen. I love the cycling community and culture that I am a part of.\nThis is a frustrating and demoralizing bill to anyone who is interested in encouraging health in citizens of all ages, independence in young people, and reducing reliance on fossil fuels. I recognize there is a learning curve for cars and bike lanes to coexist but this bill is unbelievably regressive, selfish and ill-advised.\nThis bill has me seriously reconsidering whether I want to continue to live in Ontario.\n"

        "comment": "I am strongly opposed to Bill 212. As a daily cyclist and a Toronto resident, I rely on bike lanes to commute safely and efficiently when doing everything from short neighbourhood errands to crossing the city for work.\nBy choosing to forgo a car and use a bike as my main mode of transportation, I\u2019m helping reduce congestion and pollution, making the city more livable, and healthier for everyone. Several different studies have shown that car use costs cities (and their residents) money, while bike use saves a city money. Cyclist are, in general, healthier, helping to lower healthcare costs. There are far fewer road repairs required for cycling infrastructure (which is cheaper to install than roadways in the first place). Bill 212 is inherently undemocratic, and ignores decades of data -- and the government's arguments for the necessity of the bill prove this, because you have yet to even bother demonstrating any factual evidence that this bill will reduce congestion.\nAnd beyond all of that, removing bike lanes would force cyclists like me onto busy streets, increasing the risk of accidents and potentially pushing plenty of cyclists back into cars, which would only add to traffic and emissions. This path forward makes the city less safe. My life is worth just as much as the life of a driver, and this bill is an insult to me and to everyone else in this city who is trying to be a responsible resident, all to score cheap political points. It's a disgrace, and the fact that it even has to be appealed in this form is embarrassing as an Ontarian.\nBike lanes on streets like Bloor-Danforth have proven vital for safe commuting. Instead of taking them away, the Ontario government should be investing in more cycling infrastructure to support a healthier, greener, and less congested city.\n"

        "comment": "Bike infrastructure is so important! Not only does it save lives, but every biker is someone not in a car, which reduces gridlock. By reducing bike lanes in key transportation corridors, we will induce more demand for cars making traffic worse (i.e., induced demand, a known and evidence-support urban planning concept). Also putting all those lanes in costed us a ton of money and removing them will only cost us more. It's pointless. We want people to get out of their cars and bike if they are able - it makes traffic better for everyone. The whole concept of this is ludicrous to me: paying tones of money to remove perfectly good bike lanes to only rebuild them on less convenient side streets (that often don't have bridges over waterways and add tons of km to travel times) will not improve traffic nor will it incentivise cycling. Leave the bike lanes as is and focus on more important problems, like healthcare.\n"

        "comment": "As someone who moves throughout the province and the Greater Toronto Area on foot, bicycle, public transit, and private vehicle, I am 100% opposed to this completely asinine piece of legislation.\nBike lanes save lives, improve quality of life, lead to better health outcomes, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, and most importantly, REDUCE traffic congestion.  Please pay attention to the studies that have been done on this matter - any traffic engineer will tell you that getting Ontario moving requires getting people OUT of their cars.\nThis is a simple physics problem.  You cannot legislate the laws of physics away - a reduction in bike lanes will result in more people driving, which will result in increased traffic congestion as any space that would have been freed up will quickly fill with cars sitting in traffic and not moving.  If you do not understand this, I urge you to speak to any traffic engineer or read any study on induced demand.\nFurthermore, your plan to remove existing bike lanes is  woefully misguided, spiteful, and a colossal waste of money.  If nothing else, you must understand that removing existing bicycle infrastructure is stupendously irresponsible from a purely fiscal point of view.\nThe government of Ontario is not the government of Toronto.  STAY IN YOUR LANE.\nTo conclude, I urge you with every fiber of my being to abandon this idiotic bill.\nSincerely,\nOntario resident\n"

        "comment": "I am in complete favour of the removal of bike from Bloor Street West. Every day, I have to navigate Bloor Street West from Dundas to Jane and the congestion is horrible. It\u2019s also challenging to navigate around people trying to exit their vehicles from the parking spots into live traffic. Additionally, I shudder when there are emergency vehicles trying to get to their destination but with no lanes for traffic to move off to, their task is challenging to say the least. The other concern is the lack of visibility of oncoming bike lane vehicles when trying to make a right turn onto a secondary road. The vertical pylons obstruct the visual field.\nWhile I appreciate that the city thinks that they are improving the safety of cyclists, the majority of vehicles I witness in the new bike lanes are electric bikes and scooters. I am a senior who has lived in this area for 30 years and for the record, I have been an avid cyclist for over 30 years. I also want to voice my frustration about the changes in High Park in favour of cyclists. I have several friends who are physically incapable of walking into the park when it is closed to vehicles, so we no longer congregate there on the weekends. The increased congestion in the area makes it difficult and dangerous to find a parking spot even for those who are willing to try the shuttle.\nPlease remove the bike lanes and return our neighborhood to normalcy.\n"

Some of things happening with in Ottawa, my own back yard city, is extremely alarming and the more I involve myself, the more I start to learn.\nI don\u2019t drive, I don\u2019t ride bikes. I take the OCTranpso, Uber and walk. But in my mind, it makes absolutely no sense to remove the existing bike lanes, speaking to cyclists in my are, they\u2019ve outlined the importance of them. A large amount of people I hear from that want to take bike lanes away, are simply doing it to better their life and commute, not the community. If we take out our own personal beliefs about what we individually want, and focus on what\u2019s safer, more and quicker for commuters and more community friendly. I think it\u2019s obvious that we have bike lanes and begin to expand on them, that to me makes perfect sense for what\u2019s best for the communities and safer for individuals.\nYou will never beat traffic, I feel like the idea that removing these lanes are going to increase anything, is absurd. People want something to point at, which is currently bike lanes. Their attention isnt focusing on more relevant issues in the province and county. I feel like this is a step backwards in what we should be achieving and I just hope that we can stop this. For the sake of cyclists life\u2019s and safety, we have to do better.\n"

        "comment": "In order to address the systemic urban problems of high cost of living, safety, and green house gas emissions, we would be best off transitioning toward dense, pedestrian oriented urban form (Rode et al., 2017). As cities densify, it become less practical for private vehicles to be the main mode of transportation given the amount of space they consume (Will et al., 2020). The Bill 212 - Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024 prioritizes private vehicles over more resource efficient methods of transportation (such of cycling). Consequently, Toronto and other impacted urban centers will shift towards a more expensive, dangerous and resource intensive urban form.\nHaving a mix of transportation options that includes active transport features like dedicated bike lanes improves the safety of our streets. The organization Strong Towns, founded by a transportation engineer, explains how streets are meant to facilitate people and be places of diverse economic activity, while roads are meant to quickly move vehicle traffic. We need roads to move goods and facilitate long range transportation but places like Yonge street and Bloor street best serve Toronto as economically productive streets. Trying to maximize the \u2018level of service\u2019 for vehicles on inner city streets causes them to become what is derogatorily known as stroads. Stroads don\u2019t function well as a street or a road, have less economic productively per square kilometer and have more pedestrian fatalities (Marohn, 2019; Marohn, 2021).\nBill 212 will increase the cost of living due to the high infrastructure costs and subsequent infrastructure maintenance costs that is required for ubiquitous private vehicle transportation (M\u00fcller et al., 2013). Facilitating a mix of transportation options that includes cycling, transit, and walking consumes less land (Will et al., 2020) and decreases the overall cost of transportation (Litman, 1995). Bill 212 will also increase green house gas emissions per person both due to the increased amount of infrastructure required per person and incenting car transportation (Norman et al., 2006; Bart, 2010; Jones and Kammen, 2014). A recent study by Turner et al., (2024) comparing sprawling single detached home development to compact no sprawl development in the greater golden horseshoe between 2023 and 2030 found that the sprawl development scenario led to an additional 2 MT of carbon emitted annually.\nPlease consider the glut of research that proves that shifting our city towards a dense, mixed use form with a variety of transportation options is more economically productive, safer and more environmentally friendly.\nReferences\nBart, I.

Creating communities for life is a priority for Peel Region, and this includes providing safe, convenient, and equitable options for people to get around within their community.\nWhile Peel Region shares the importance of finding solutions to tackle traffic gridlock, there a number of challenges with the bike lane proposals in Bill 212, including the framework not aligning to or supporting Peel Region\u2019s various transportation plans and strategies and the lack of clarity with a few provisions. In addition to these issues, Peel Region staff want to highlight the social and environmental benefits of bike lanes.\nPeel Region staff\u2019s specific comments on the proposed legislation regarding these issues and benefits are outlined below. Please note that the following comments are provided by Peel Region staff and may be considered by Regional Council for endorsement at a later date. If additional or differing comments are provided through a Council resolution, they will be forwarded to the Ministry for consideration.\nPEEL REGION STAFF SPECIFIC COMMENTS\nBike Lane Framework Not Aligned with Peel Region\u2019s Transportation Plans & Strategies\nPeel's Transportation plans and strategies are being updated to align with the 2024 Provincial Planning Statement, which is supportive of using bike lanes. The Province\u2019s bike lane framework is not aligned and may impact Peel Region\u2019s ability to achieve the goals and vision set out in its various transportation plans and strategies.  These impacts are highlighted below:\n\u2022\tPeel's Long Range Transportation Plan supports providing residents and commuters with a variety of travel options, including bike lanes, that support community connections, enhance public health, air quality, and mitigate climate change. The proposed legislation limits Peel's ability to plan for and achieve this vision, including reaching our climate change goals.\n\u2022\tIn planning for complete roads that support multiple modes of transportation, removing bike lanes poses serious safety risks. Peel Region's Vision Zero road safety plan prioritizes safety over other factors such as cost, speed, delay, level of service, and convenience, as no loss of life is acceptable due to a motor vehicle collision. Any restriction on bike lanes may interfere with Peel's ability to achieve the outcomes of Vision Zero and put cyclists at unnecessary risk.\n\u2022\tThe Region's Sustainable Transportation Strategy aims to achieve a 50% sustainable mode share by 2041. One of the actions for achieving this goal is to encourage and support cycling to and from schools, transit hubs, and other community destinations. Bike lanes are an important part of making trips such as these, as well as connecting trips to and from transit, known as the first and last mile. The bike lane amendments in Bill 212 could impact local municipal and Regional planned cycling networks, that are central to achieving Peel Region\u2019s 50% sustainable mode share goal alongside other modes of active transportation as well as public transit.\nSome Bike Lane Framework Provisions Require Greater Clarity\nCertain provisions in the Province\u2019s proposed bike lane framework need further clarification as they could affect existing bikes lanes or planned bike lanes as well as apply to multi-use paths.  Greater clarity and more information are needed to determine financial, social and property impacts.   The provisions and matters in question are outlined below:\n\u2022\tIn the provision for the supply of municipal data and Ministry review of existing bike lanes created by converting or removing any traffic lanes, no timeline is given under Schedule 4, Part XII, 195.2 regarding how far back the Ministry would review existing bicycle lanes on municipal roads. If these bike lanes are reverted to traffic lanes, there could be major implications in terms of the function, conversion, and connectivity of Peel\u2019s transportation infrastructure, including financial, social or property impacts.\n\u2022\tThe proposed legislation is unclear whether it applies to dedicated bicycle lanes only or any type of cycling infrastructure, such as multi-use paths, which provides accessible and equitable travel options for all users including cyclists, pedestrians, and wheelchair users. If the legislation includes multi-use paths and cycling infrastructure that could be discontinued at highway crossings, this could affect Peel\u2019s Active Transportation Strategy. Additionally, it may pose challenges in terms of time and resources needed for the Ministry\u2019s approval process.\n\u2022\tSchedule 4, Part XII, 195.2 subsection (1) suggests that Regional and municipal roads with existing or planned bicycle lanes impacted by Highways may be considered for removal, which would significantly impact the planned cycling network and cause disconnections and separation between communities.\n\u2022\tAs Regional Roads are typically major arterial roadways and support heavy truck traffic, bicycle lanes are often screened out for on-boulevard facilities. In rural areas where roads are not urbanized, Peel provides a wider paved shoulder which functions as an \u201caccessible shoulder\u201d for pedestrians and cyclists. The Region is unclear as to whether these accessible shoulders would be impacted by the proposed legislation. On rural non-urbanized regional roads, wider paved shoulders serve as joint use for pedestrians and cyclists. It is unclear in Bill 212 if these accessible shoulders will be affected by the proposed legislation.\nThe Benefits of Bike Lanes\nThe installation of bike lanes on municipal road has several financial, health and environmental benefits, which are detailed below:\n\u2022\tBicycle lanes can increase safe access to low-cost mobility for lower income populations, provide first- and last-mile connections to support public transit use as previously mentioned, and expand access to employment opportunities. The language in Bill 212 suggests the prioritization of vehicles over other types of travel, including active transportation, which may further marginalize those who rely on active transportation as a primary method of transportation (particularly among transportation-disadvantaged groups such as seniors, youth, and low-income residents, for example). Peel Region advocates for equitable travel options for those who cannot afford to drive, or where transit is not available, which is currently the case in many rural areas within the Region.\n\u2022\tPeel Region continues to advocate for a modal split that promotes the benefits of active transportation, which include financial, health, and environmental benefits including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\u2022\tThe Financial Accountability Office of Ontario recently reported that as climate change continues to be present in Ontario communities, the cost of maintaining road network infrastructure will escalate. Peel Region advocates for fiscal prudence on behalf of residents and taxpayers, including exploring and allowing for less costly alternative transportation infrastructure such as bicycle lanes.\n\u2022\tFurthermore, shifting travel behaviours away from single-occupancy vehicle travel and towards more active/sustainable travel modes can improve local air quality and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\u2022\tThe proposed legislation may have negative impacts on health outcomes among Peel residents by creating barriers to building healthy, complete communities with safe, connected multimodal infrastructure. Evidence demonstrates that bicycle lanes enable active living, advance health equity, address the health-related impacts of climate change, and improve road safety.\n\u2022\tEvidence indicates that providing safe, comfortable, and connected walking and cycling infrastructure encourages active transportation, a proven way for residents to incorporate physical activity into their day that can lower the risk of chronic diseases associated with inactivity and improve mental wellbeing.\nConclusion\nPeel Region staff have identified a number of issues for consideration regarding Bill 212 framework for bike lanes. The proposed bike lane framework is not aligned with the Region\u2019s various transportation plans and strategies and may limit its ability to improve road safety, provide residents more travel options and achieve a 50% modal split. There are also certain components of the proposed bike framework that need to be clarified in order for Peel Region to properly determine any financial, social and infrastructure impacts.  Finally, we highlighted some of the financial, health and environmental benefits of installing and expanding bike infrastructure networks.\n"

        "comment": "The wording of the title of your bill is very misleading. Bike lanes do not lead to gridlock more cars on the road do. I rely on bike lanes in Toronto to get around safely in the city, from work and back and to various places en route.  I travel with my family by bike and all members of my household travel on bikes in Toronto. I am especially concerned about the removal of these bike lanes and how it will affect my child\u2019s safety when biking on Toronto streets. As we all know, cars regularly break traffic violations and cause danger for cyclists on the road and having separated bike lanes ensures the safety of everyone including car drivers. As for the loss of business argument, studies around the world show that bike lanes increase business along their routes Since a cyclist is more likely to make multiple stops when it is easy to pull over rather than a car that cannot find a parking spot. I find this true myself as I regularly do errands on bike which are much more efficient and quick to do in my neighbourhood due to the ease and safety of bike length. This would not be possible for me with a car in my neighbourhood because there\u2019s very limited parking. We all know that climate change is another unavoidable and undeniable factor that we are facing The consequences of throughout the year and across the country and province.. installing and maintaining bike infrastructure helps get cars off the road and reduces carbon emissions which lead to further exacerbating carb climate change. I don\u2019t hear you making proposals for alternatives to cars such as mass rapid transit separated bus lanes late rapid transit above ground other than the decades plus plan to increase subway service to limited areas in the city. Bike infrastructure offers an efficient way of getting around that is far more environmental than adding more cars to Toronto\u2019s streets. I am strongly opposed to the removal of bike lanes in Toronto, especially along Bloor street.\n"

It is dangerous for the very few bikers who use the biking lanes.\nBloor street does not need bike lanes when it already has the TTC.  Bike lanes should be on side streets, where there is no access to TTC and where congestion is not as much an issue.\n"
