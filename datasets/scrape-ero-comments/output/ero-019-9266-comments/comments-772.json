This is personal for me, as I was hit, by a vehicle that ran a stop sign on a road without any accommodation for cyclists. The impact of the car, fractured 10 of my ribs, which has caused life long injuries and reduced health. Thankfully, the growing network of heavily used bike lanes in Ottawa, makes most of my ride much safer.\nThe idea that Ottawa's Transportation Master Plan should be controlled by the Ontario Minister of Transportation is a clear sign of provincial government overreach. There is no ability for this politician to have the necessary nuanced understanding of the streets and intersections of Ottawa and how bicycle infrastructure fits into the Ottawa's Transportation Master.\nRather the purpose of Bill 212 is strictly political and favors car centric transportation for key voting demographics. It ignores the necessary transition to multi modal transportation that is truly needed to address the growth of our cities and reduce grid-lock.\nI am especially appalled that Bill 212 is so willing to put the speed drivers, over the safety of its citizens on bicycles.\n"

        "comment": "To the MTO:\nI am writing to express my opposition to the provisions in Bill 212, designated the \"Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024\". After thoroughly examining the text of the bill, there are significant issues that should be addressed before such a bill should be passed.\n- The government is adding additional red tape and bureaucracy that will slow down the ability of municipal governments to implement additional transportation options, forcing them to have everything approved at the provincial level. Removing existing bike lanes does not make financial sense and is a huge waste of taxpayer dollars.\n- The argument that bike lanes are underutilized is poor. I only drive because I have no alternative to reach my place of employment. If bike lanes existed that I could use, I would use them, but the ones where I live are incomplete and only supported by car infrastructure. Cars are one of the most inefficient means to move large volumes of people, which could be accomplished much better using cycling, public transportation, train, or subway. The number of cars on our streets continues to grow annually, and our roads cannot support this continued increase in volume without considering other possibilities. Global studies show bike lanes can ease congestion, reduce emissions and are a boon to businesses (see linked article)\n- Removing bike lanes will not remove cyclists from the road, as should not even need pointing out. It will just make cycling less safe and ensure that cyclists are in the way of traffic rather than contained to a designated area. How could you possibly think that mixing bicycles and car traffic will reduce gridlock on city streets? There is no data to support this notion.\n- Bike lanes support other forms of transit traffic by making it easier to commute to these locations and not having to leave a vehicle sitting in a parking lot where it could be broken into or vandalized.\n- Bill 212 overemphasizes expanding road infrastructure, which through induced demand, will likely have no effect on the level of traffic on the road. There is no magic number of lanes that will make traffic flow smoothly, and Ontario's highway system is becoming a laughing stock. The 401 highway, at 18 lanes at its widest point, is considered to be the widest highway in the entire world, and it still has not solved traffic congestion issues. The province needs to consider alternatives that will reduce the number of vehicles on the road, not add to the problem.\n- The environmental consequences of the act should not be underestimated. More roads will lead to higher carbon emissions, in direct contradiction to Ontario's climate goals. Air quality issue pose a significant health hazard to the citizens of our city and will further burden our struggling healthcare system. It also encourages urban sprawl along transportation corridors, which reduce green space and put significant pressure on municipal services in new development areas.\n- The bill makes no mention of approaches such as congestion pricing, which attempt to decrease demand in high traffic areas during peak hours. It's a similar concept to how pricing is done for energy and utilities. If you want to reduce demand, you need to disincentivize travel during times where it is already too high.\n- I do not agree with the provisions of the bill allowing the government to bypass the Environmental Assessment process (Schedule 3: \"the schedule enacts the Highway 413 Act, 2024. Section 2 of the Act provides an exemption from the Environmental Assessment Act for enterprises, activities, proposals, plans and programs for or related to Highway 413, including the Highway 413 Project and the Highway 413 early works projects.\"), nor do I agree with the expanded powers for expropriation without sufficient public consultation. These provisions undermine landowners' rights and due process, with no regard for community impacts. There are countless case studies of instances where highways were rammed through large city areas and the negative effects that followed. Environmental assessments exist to make sure that the citizenry can participate fully in the process, and by unilaterally overruling them, as this government has been so fond of doing via the use of the 'notwithstanding clause', is undemocratic and not something I support.\nIn conclusion, I believe this bill requires significant revision before being passed, and while I applaud the goals of addressing traffic congestion, the approach being adopted by the bill does not align with the current body of knowledge regarding modern civic engineering principles, and seems to ignore innovative transportation alternatives that are better suited to address modern urban transportation issues.\n"

        "comment": "Ontario's Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, which aims to improve transportation infrastructure and reduce traffic congestion, is a proposal that may sound promising on the surface, but upon closer examination, it reveals several flaws that could worsen the problem it seeks to address and ultimately lead to long-term negative consequences.\n1. Overemphasis on Expanding Road Infrastructure\nOne of the central components of the Act is the expansion of road networks and highways to alleviate gridlock. While this may seem like a direct solution to traffic problems, it fails to account for the well-established phenomenon of induced demand. This concept suggests that simply building more roads encourages more people to drive, which can actually increase congestion in the long run. Rather than reducing gridlock, expanding infrastructure often leads to even worse traffic as more vehicles take advantage of the newly constructed lanes, quickly filling them up. This cycle of endless road expansion is not a sustainable solution and could ultimately lead to a \u201cbigger is worse\u201d situation.\n2. Environmental Impact and Urban Sprawl\nThe Act\u2019s focus on road-building and expanding highways also overlooks the environmental consequences of such projects. More roads lead to greater carbon emissions, which is a direct contradiction to Ontario\u2019s climate goals. The construction and maintenance of highways require significant energy and materials, and increased car usage contributes to air pollution and worsens the province's carbon footprint. Additionally, expanding highways encourages urban sprawl, as more land is developed for new housing, businesses, and industries along major roadways. This sprawl can diminish green spaces, harm ecosystems, and increase the pressure on municipal services in new suburban areas.\n3. Neglecting Public Transit and Active Transportation\nThe Act\u2019s focus on roads and highways overlooks the crucial role of public transportation and active transportation (e.g., walking and cycling) in solving gridlock. For Ontario to truly reduce traffic congestion and improve quality of life, the government needs to prioritize investments in transit systems, such as buses, subways, and commuter trains. Expanding these systems would provide Ontarians with viable alternatives to driving, reducing the overall number of vehicles on the road. The Act should also place a stronger emphasis on creating safe cycling lanes and pedestrian pathways to encourage active modes of transport. By neglecting these areas, the government is not addressing the underlying need for sustainable transportation solutions.\n4. Lack of Focus on Congestion Pricing and Demand Management\nInstead of simply building more roads, Ontario should explore solutions that manage traffic demand. Measures like congestion pricing, which charges vehicles to enter high-traffic areas during peak hours, have proven effective in cities around the world, such as London and New York. The Act misses this opportunity to implement more sophisticated strategies to reduce congestion in a way that encourages people to take public transit or adjust their travel habits. Without addressing demand management, the province risks continuing to support a car-dependent culture, which exacerbates gridlock rather than alleviating it.\n5. Impact on Local Communities and Quality of Life\nThe expansion of highways and road networks under this Act could have detrimental effects on local communities. New roads often pass through residential neighborhoods, leading to increased noise, pollution, and the disruption of local businesses. These communities may find themselves trapped between expanding highways and deteriorating environmental conditions, ultimately reducing their quality of life. Additionally, road expansion can lead to displacement of existing residents, particularly in underprivileged areas, who may be forced to relocate due to construction projects or gentrification driven by increased access to transportation corridors.\n6. Missed Opportunity for Innovative Solutions\nInstead of continuing with outdated and car-centric solutions, the Ontario government should be looking for more innovative transportation alternatives. This could include increasing investment in shared mobility services like carpooling, ride-hailing, and autonomous vehicles. There is also potential to integrate smart traffic management systems that can reduce congestion by optimizing traffic flow. These technologies are not given enough attention in the Act, which suggests the government is still focused on old models of transportation infrastructure that may no longer be the most effective in addressing modern challenges.\nConclusion\nWhile the Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act proposes a solution to Ontario's traffic problems, its heavy reliance on expanding road infrastructure and neglect of alternative transportation options are shortsighted and ineffective in the long run. The government\u2019s focus on road construction is likely to exacerbate traffic congestion, contribute to environmental degradation, and encourage urban sprawl. To truly solve Ontario's gridlock issues, the government should prioritize sustainable transportation solutions, such as investing in public transit, improving active transportation infrastructure, and adopting congestion pricing and demand management strategies. Without these measures, the Act risks perpetuating the very problems it intends to resolve.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is not going to positively affect traffic and gridlock in the city. More lanes doesn\u2019t equal less congestion. The opposite is true. Now there will be congestion plus cyclists who will be unprotected by barriers and make driving more stressful by sharing lanes. The province has no business changing the municipal streets of Toronto.  The people who live and use the streets of Toronto should be the ones deciding how the city will handle this. Also, trying to avoid the natural assessments to be done by highway 413 is nonsense. Haven\u2019t we learned that we need to be stewards to this land? If we don\u2019t assess environmental impact of something as large as a highway how is that responsible stewardship? It could cause new flood planes for local farms, wildlife and habitat loss.\nPlease leave the bike lane decision to be made by our city council not provincial government. And please make sure the decisions we make for development don\u2019t just suit us in the immediate but will protect the environment for future generations and our neighbors. I say more bike lanes, more trains, more TTC and less cars and highways.\n"

I think it's short-sighted, naive, wasteful, and cynical. It demonstrates a profound lack of creativity and vision, as well as a stunning disregard toward the safety and wellbeing of Ontario commuters.\nI'm extremely busy with work, so I regret that I cannot go into great detail on just how rotten your proposal is. I wish that I had more time to share my thoughts. I also wish that the \"Saving You Time Act\" was going to save me time, but it truly won't. But regardless of that, the goal is wrong. You're coming up with a narrow-minded solution to a superficial problem. Have you asked the right questions yet?\nAs a creative exercise, let me invite you to close your eyes and imagine the kind of city you'd want to live in. Really, try it. Maybe you would see trees and parks and children playing in green spaces. Maybe there are doctors and teachers paid living wages. Maybe people are riding bicycles and taking safe and well funded public transport. Maybe everyone has a roof overhead and feels like they are part of a community.\nI hope that you can imagine such a world. As it stands, it sounds as though your vision is an urban hellscape choked with cars as far as the eye can see, and the only possible future improvement is to add more space for cars so that more cars can take up that space.\nPlease reconsider.\nTimothy\n"

Studies (like this https://tcat.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Bike-Lanes-and-Business-on-B\u2026) show that bike lanes are a good thing, and increase business! If the MOT wants to make a positive economic impact (as he claims removing lanes will do) we should actually build more. Yes it can be inconvenient as a driver, but that doesn't mean they should be removed. Bike lanes feel more comfortable to bike safely through the city. Meaning one less person driving or using public transit. One less car parked somewhere. These bike lanes are essential.\nIt's also incredibly frustrating the Premiere of Ontario thinks he should be making municipal decisions. He should not. He should leave it to the city government. I understand people in Etobicoke are frustrated by the bike lanes, but people in Toronto like them and use them. The Minister of Transportation continues to cite decades old stats to try to back up this bill, when in reality I'm sure he and the Premier know that today's stats wouldn't support removing the lanes. Drivers will always be angry and frustrated by traffic, removing bike lanes will not change that. Mr. Ford will still receive calls from angry drivers until the end of time.\nOther major cities are building more bike infrastructure, not removing it. Why? Because they increase business for local shops and increase safety for cyclists (and drivers!) among other proven positivies. Toronto (and Ontario) should continue moving forward to the future, even if it's not always by car.\n"

        "comment": "The removal of bike lanes in Toronto is regressive policy that panders to those who visit the city and prize car convenience over the safety and autonomy of those who live here.\nTo forefront, I\u2019m a lifelong Torontonian who owns a vehicle, takes the TTC, and rides a bike. I am also someone who has been struck by a speeding motor vehicle while crossing at a dedicated crosswalk. I purposely moved away from a car-centric neighbourhood to a neighbourhood that affords me the ability to use multiple forms of transportation, and this bill, while ultimately is about obscuring the corruption regarding the development of the Greenbelt, is also forcing dated ideals of what a city looks like onto a city that should be *progressing* and not part of a city I want to live in.\nI live right off Danforth Avenue in Oakridge, approximately 800m east of where the bike lanes end. We have four schools, two places of worship, a recreation centre, and a supportive housing complex along our stretch of the Danforth- a lot of children and elderly people. We\u2019ll come back to this.\nWhile traffic along the Danforth from Broadview to VP is slow, it is safe- as a motorist, I LOVE that the right lane isn\u2019t gummed up with parked cars, or people bobbing and weaving through lanes. As a pedestrian, slower traffic is safer traffic (again, getting hit by a car and being told by the off-duty firefighter who witnessed it that he thought I died makes me reasonably nervous about navigating traffic, especially now that enforcement seems non-existent.)\nBut also, the data has shown that the increase in car travel times is only a matter of few minutes. Are we really putting the value of a couple minutes ahead of peoples lives and safety?\nNow, back to Oakridge. After the bike lanes end east of VP, cars FLY and the street becomes a de facto Indy500. I am TIRED of playing roulette with my life every time I cross my street and inevitably contend with speeding cars running red lights while I have the right of way to cross. This is a DAILY OCCURRENCE.\nBut it\u2019s not just crossing the street- it\u2019s also the sidewalks. The lack of bike lanes mean I also have to share the sidewalk with my bike riding neighbours, many of whom are young people and elderly. And while that\u2019s annoying, I\u2019d still rather see a cyclist safe on the sidewalk than dead on the side of the road (because expecting an elderly person to squeeze into the right lane alongside cars doing 70km/hr is a bonkers prospect).\nIn short, I am angry- beyond angry about this bill. This bill doesn\u2019t represent my wants and needs as a resident, it doesn\u2019t reflect the needs and safety concerns of my neighbourhood, and most importantly- it is not 1979. Toronto is no longer a sea of parking lots. It is dense, it is crowded, and it\u2019s growing. Promising to prioritize cars to a voting block who salivates at the prospect of \u201cowning the libs\u201d by making streets more dangerous is frankly ghoulish.\nIf you\u2019re insistent on extracting every natural resource of this province for maximum profit for a select few, my goodness- let us normal working people have the ability to ride a bike safely to our second and third jobs so we can afford to live here. A lot of us can\u2019t afford cars or afford to live in proximity to reliable transit.\n"

Locals like myself have spoken time and time again about our support for bike lanes and yet the Ontario PC Party continues to ignore the actual data that shows the impact of bike lanes over time.\nOn top of all of that I want a government that actively pushes back against single driver vehicles and focuses instead on building up public transit to hopefully get to a point where nobody in Ontario even needs a car. Having lived in downtown Toronto for nearly twelve years now, I've always said that I would buy a car when I need one and in that time I've rented cars twice and both of those times were to leave the city to head to cottage country. Bike lanes make me feel safer as a pedestrian, as a cyclist, and as a citizen of this city. Too many times I've seen cars run lights or encroach on bike riders and we've all seen the headlines about what happens when a cyclist and a car driver crash, and it's not the car driver we have to worry about.\nStop bowing to the out-of-towners who voted you in and *listen* to the people in Toronto about what we want. I guarantee you more people are in favour of bike lanes than against. Instead of spending tens of millions of dollars tearing out perfectly good bike lanes and then spending $3 billion dollars on small rebates across the province you could spend that money on healthcare or one of the many other areas your government has failed Ontario residents in.\n"
