        "comment": "I do not support this bill. The primary reason is that I don\u2019t agree that the province should be able to make decisions about bike lanes which are a municipal issue. Whether or not a bike lane is impacting traffic/safety in a particular Neighbourhood is something that must be negotiated by those who are directly impacted, and not by the provincial government which is seeming guided by a car-focussed agenda and involves people who are outside of the affected areas.\nI have lived in downtown Toronto, east of the Don Valley, for more than 30 years. I do not drive a car and, until retirement a year ago, commuted to work primarily by bike, in addition to TTC or walking. I began cycling in Toronto before there were many bike lanes. I cycle defensively and feel relatively comfortable sharing the road with cars in situations where both driver and cyclist consider each other, and neither feel \u2018entitled\u2019 to the road, which sadly is not always the case (in either case). However, not all people feel comfortable cycling on Toronto streets, and indeed there is always going to be a learning curve for new cyclists, a period of time where a cyclist becomes more confident on the road. This takes time, and many people won\u2019t immediately jump on their bike just because a bike lane is built in their neighborhood. Is this the reason for the apparently few cyclist on the new Bloor St West cycle lanes?  Maybe there are other problems? How can I know - I do not live in that neighborhood, and neither do the majority in power (and their constituents) in the provincial government. However, my experiences in other areas of Toronto support bike lanes and the continued improvement of the cycling infrastructure.\nI used to live at Avenue Rd and Davenport and commuted by bike along Avenue Rd/University Ave  to my job at a hospital. The other route option at the time was Bay St but the bus lanes made this very dangerous. University Avenue was scary - the speed of drivers on a downtown street like that was unreasonable. I have more recently travelled by bike on the new University Ave bike lanes and what an improvement! I felt so much safer. Please don\u2019t remove those, they are one of the only good North/South options for cyclists (and despite the lanes, the cars still seem to be moving along nicely). I also feel very positively about the Bloor St Bike Lane. I used to often travel by bike between the east end and my children\u2019s high school near Bloor and Runnymede. Travelling along Bloor St without the bike lanes was not comfortable due primarily to parked cars (\u2018dooring\u2019 fear) and the amount of traffic. So I  biked out of my way along Davenport, or south along College St, which added considerably to the commute time. I was so happy when the Bloor bike lanes (both east and west) were installed. I should also point out that I discovered a number of new shops along this route because of these easily travelled new bike routes. Please don\u2019t  remove these bike lanes.\nWith the installation of bike lanes along major east/west downtown routes, I have experienced the change in the number of cyclists commuting. For example, 30 years ago there were few commuters travelling by bike along Gerrard St. There are now many cyclists travelling that route. The same can be said about College St. Where I worked at Sickkids, our bike storage rooms are now always full.\nFinally, a point about the loss of car lanes when bike lanes are installed. When I cycle along busy, main streets with multiple lanes but without bike lanes, what I observe is that stopped cars and delivery trucks often block one of the lanes essentially forcing the use of only one lane by moving cars. How is this different to having a bike lane there!?\nObviously, I am a cycling advocate with limited experience of driving in Toronto. However, I do live here and am willing to consider the experiences of others who also live here. I do not believe that people living outside our city should be making decisions about\ntraffic and transport in a place they know little or nothing about. That is the job of the municipality.\n"

        "comment": "I'm deeply against the removal of bike lanes on major Toronto streets as it is a hit to the city's accessibility and denies cyclists their safety. I can't understand why we should continue to only prioritize cars as our major form of transportation when the GTA is known for having some of the worst traffic in all of North America, and while we are doing so little to lessen the impact of climate change on all levels. The prioritization of bike lanes and other forms of accessible, affordable transportation is crucial in allowing people the option to traverse their city in a way that best suits them, and ultimately allows us as a community to divest in cars in a time when it is desperately needed to help secure our future. Additionally, it's been proven that instances of covid infection/long covid have impacts on cognitive function similar to that of seizure disorders and alcohol consumption, and has been theorized to have increased rates of reckless driving and car accidents in recent years.  We need to better prioritize modes of transportation that, if involved in an accident, has the least chance of doing major harm. Thank you for your time.\n"

        "comment": "I am a senior who loves to drive a car for long trips, but I choose to bicycle daily, year round, for short trips, to commute across Burlington, shop locally, and for recreation and exercise. Safe bicycling infrastructure is essential to my safety and I use protected bike lanes whenever possible and unprotected bike lanes when necessary.\nRemoving my safe bicycling infrastructure options goes against everything in the title of this act. For local trips, my bike is faster, cheaper, and reduces gridlock by taking my car out of the dense urban transportation system. It allows me to exercise while commuting or shopping and contributes to my mental health without adding a heavy carbon footprint.\nBike lanes protect people choosing to walk by providing a buffer from car traffic and by avoiding the dangerous situation of having bikes scrambling on the sidewalks. In conjunction with dedicated public transport lanes, bike share, scooters, subways, high speed rail, and LRTs, they reduce congestion and gridlock. As has been evidenced over the world and here in Canada, adding car lanes provides a blip of relief, immediately followed by increased congestion due to the dynamic of induced demand. This is why adding lanes to the 401 has not reduced congestion.\nSome say that bike lanes are underutilised. This is only the case with unprotected, dangerous, narrow, white lines on the road lanes, especially if they are unconnected to a comprehensive network. Safer protected bike lanes get used for commuting and utility year round, especially if they are connected to a network and truly get people where they want to go. This is evidenced internationally in world-class cities such as London, New York, Amsterdam, Copenhagen, and Madrid.\nPeople who complain that Canada's environment doesn't allow for year round cycling due to inclement weather need only look at Canadian cities such as Calgary, Victoria, Montreal, and Toronto where the protected network connected bike lanes are used in all seasons.\nLocal democratically elected municipal councils working with their  staff and responding to public input are best able to tailor urban solutions for their unique local traffic difficulties. They need financial support from the Province, not overreach and micromanagement. This is particularly true next door  in Hamilton, with the safety redesign of Main Street from one way to two way traffic, with wider pedestrian walkways and some limited protected bike infrastructure linking to existing networks. This plan was a response to the significant number of pedestrian deaths recently on this roadway. Our council has moved fast with staff to literally save lives. This act would negate all the safety of these changes.\nHere in Burlington, I volunteer for the Hamilton Burlington chapter of Cycling Without Age programme. There are 60 volunteers (mostly seniors themselves) who are our pilots, bike buddies, trainers, and site managers. We use pedal electric-assist Trishaws to give shut in Seniors the right to the wind in their hair and a chance to connect again with people and nature. We service many retirement residences as well as nursing and long term care homes in Hamilton and Burlington. Safe protected bicycle infrastructure is essential to keeping our seniors safe while transporting them to and from the Waterfront trail, park trails, and shops. The effects of these connective trips are evidenced by the smiles and effusive joy communicated to family and caregivers post ride. One senior with dementia, who had not spoken in 5 years reduced his wife and co-passenger to tears when he turned and said \u201cThank You\u201d to the pilot of the Trishaw! These trips are the  highlight of their day and we are scrambling to keep up with the demand for our program. We have a Trishaw in Burlington,  two in Hamilton (the one on the mountain is wheelchair accessible), and have just expanded into Dundas.\nOur safety shouldn't be jeopardised for someone else's convenience. I respectfully request that this section of the bill be removed, and that bike lane management be left where it belongs, with the municipal governments.\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nI live in Ontario and have lived in Toronto for nearly 15 years. I love Toronto's biking infrastructure and want to see it expand, not be destroyed. When the path to my destination has not only bike lanes, but PROTECTED bike lanes, I feel safe enough to choose cycling over any other means of transit. I love cycling, I love having this option, and I want more opportunities to cycle throughout the city.\nWhat we need is MORE bike infrastructure to protect vulnerable cyclists. I hear more and more stories every year about cyclists in Toronto who have been killed or permanently injured by vehicles. Whether it's being doored by driver who didn't look or being flattened by a truck while making a turn, Toronto's lawmakers need to remember that cyclists are VULNERABLE, far more vulnerable than either the cars or those in them. Cyclists deserve to be considered and they deserve to be SAFE.\nWhat Toronto needs is more options for transportation, especially options that are SAFE, AFFORDABLE, and NON-POLLUTING. We don't need more red tape or bureaucracy. We need representatives that prioritise the safety of their citizens, not the quickness of their own personal commute.\n"

        "comment": "Naming this Bill \"Reducing Gridlock\" and the subtext that this is about bike lanes is a clear bait and switch situation. Nothing in this bill will do anything to improve traffic flow, and will only add years of construction, at a cost of billions, which will only serve to add MORE gridlock and car congestion for the foreseeable future, at the cost of everyone in the province, including those who don't/can't drive.\nIn regards to Schedule 1 to 3:\nThe Province seems to want to fast track 'Priority projects' which are mainly more highways, while adding exemptions for potential development on Greenbelt land. Adding these open ended exemptions from Environmental Assessment is shady business!\nSchedule 1 outlines building broadband, which suggests that highway 413 will be tolled, and we know from the 407, with its 99 year lease, that this cost to taxpayers was a BAD DEAL! This will not give anything back to the province, only developers will profit from this. Giving the province these exemptions is very worrying tactic, as the Province will be able to call anything they want a 'Priority project' in the future, with these exemptions already in place. These 'Priority projects' will do nothing to serve people struggling in our cities, people who don't/can't drive. Adding more concrete and removing green land will only exacerbate the climate emergency, which is what Environmental Assessment aims to protect. We don't need another toll highway!\nRegarding Schedule 4:\nThe fact that this is a very small section, and has been tacked onto the title, seemingly only serves to get people divided, pitting drivers against people who cycle, and distracting from the serious consequences of Schedules 1-3.\nWe know from MANY global studies (one recent one linked below) that adding more lanes on roads/highways will do nothing to improve traffic, it will only just get more people in cars to fill those extra lanes. This will also dissuade the huge uptick of new people on bikes that these new lanes have encouraged to cycle, who will now go back to their cars. Not to mention confident cyclists who will now need to 'take the lane' for their own safety.\nOur city streets are already congested as is, and removing bike lanes will come at an unnecessary cost to the city (48 million estimated for Toronto), and will also add gridlock by closing lanes for road work. This city is much more than drivers and cyclists, many of us don't/can't drive, we take transit, and/or walk in our walkable neighborhoods. Removing bike lanes will only serve to make our roads less safe for vulnerable road users, and cost small businesses their foot traffic. Reducing car dependency should be the priority, not getting more people in cars, which is what's causing traffic.\nThis past weekend we had a day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims, and unfortunately this is all due to the prioritization of cars. Fatalities in our city are at record numbers, especially for people on bikes. More bikes on the roads means less people in cars. Bike lanes make our roads safer for EVERYONE, including pedestrians and people on mobility devices, some who also use bike lanes, who are safer with less cars at slower speeds. Walking and cycling, when possible, are better for our environment, our health, and it would serve everyone in our communities if we can feel safe when choosing these alternatives.\nIn conclusion, I believe that prioritizing highways (especially tolled), and exempting Environmental Assessment, does not serve our cities, who overwhelmingly are asking for transit improvements, and safer streets. Road infrastructure decisions should remain in the hands of municipalities and city councils, who understand their streets best because we live here, have access to the latest local data, personally know people who have been affected by road violence, and that our streets will not feel safer for vulnerable road users, and those who choose cleaner/better alternative forms of transportations.\nThank you.\n"

        "comment": "It is my professional opinion after 20 years of leadership in the Canadian Real Estate industry that the removal of bikelanes negatively impacts property values. Conversely, in most urban locations the addition of bike lanes improves property valuation in measured terms. Walk Score and Transit Score are common features of listings.\n'Location efficiency' and 'bike amenity' as a real estate value proposition has a proven demonstrable impact on real estate valuation in marketplaces globally. Especially in communities that have strong walkability scores already. the addition of bike amenity in suburban contexts is demonstrated to have less impact (not negative impact) on property value.\nIn my opinion passing this legislation opens the province to class action litigation risk by property owners who are:\nSeeing tax dollars allocated to devaluation of property and negatively impacting neighbourhood reputation and desirability\nSeeing less investment in improving property values in urban areas in the province of Ontario\nProperty values in urban areas benefit from bike lanes.

Improving traffic flow and easing congestion in Toronto is complicated and we cannot continue to implement short-term fixes which only increase long term pressures on the city.

I am a driver.  I drive downtown twice a day 5 days a week.  It is awful.  The problem is not the bike lane on Yonge or University.  I would urge all levels of govenment to work together as they are doing to improve things in Toronto.  Ripping out bike lanes will not help people's commutes and it will endanger the lives of cyclists.  I would also note that we lost a neighbour several years ago.  He was riding his bike to work.  He was killed by a motorist.  We need to make the city safer for all and look  at solutions that improve living and commuting conditions for all residents.

Removing the bike lanes from these key arteries (Bloor, University and Yonge) would not remove cyclists from those streets - cyclists would continue to use them, putting their lives at risk and making it less safe (and more frustrating) for drivers. There are no adequate alternatives that run parallel to these main streets.\nI implore the Ontario government to use common sense, listen to the research, and understand the concept of \"induced demand\": it has been widely proven that if more roads are built, more cars will come. Ripping up these bike lanes does not mean commute times will shorten. It means the roads will be clogged with more cars, and that more people will die as a result.\nThe protected bike lane along a portion of Bloor was only recently completed, after months of construction and millions of dollars. Finally, cyclists (including me) have a safe way to get around. Removing this lane after it was just completed would cost taxpayers millions, result in endless more months of construction, and remove the safe infrastructure that was only just installed. We do not need more cars spewing planet-warming pollution into the streets and increasing health hazards.\nListen to your constituents and make the sensible, safe decision. Do not pass Bill 212.\n"

The exemption of Highway 413 from environmental assessments will destroy vital ecosystems, including wetlands and Greenbelt lands, undermining Ontario\u2019s natural flood control, biodiversity, and carbon storage capabilities. This project directly contradicts our province\u2019s climate goals and will lock us into decades of increased greenhouse gas emissions and car dependency.\nFurthermore, the proposed removal of key bike lanes in Toronto is a significant step backward. These bike lanes not only improve safety and accessibility for cyclists but also reduce congestion, lower emissions, and support local businesses. Removing this infrastructure will harm public health, increase gridlock, and disproportionately impact those who rely on cycling as an affordable transportation option.\nAt a projected cost of over $8 billion, Highway 413 represents a misuse of taxpayer funds that could be better spent on sustainable, forward-thinking solutions like public transit and cycling infrastructure.

This is certainly true on Yonge Street, University and Bloor which I routinely cycle and occasionally drive. While driving I do not notice any increased congestion on these streets. Even if there might be a longer drive time of a few minutes - that is an excellent trade-off for the peace of mind. And I feel equally sorry for the driver who accidentally kills or maims a cyclist as I do for the victim and their family.\nNew cycling infrastructure in this city has allowed me to choose my bike over my car. Except for occasional driving to transport passengers or large goods I now ride my bike everywhere for business shopping, and pleasure. Distance is not a deterrent. I ride year round in all weather except snow. I have cycled 7,000 km in Toronto on my bike since September 2021 when I started keeping count. That is 7K of travel with one less car on Toronto roads. More space for those who cannot ride and must drive.\nWe are all still learning how to manage more cars and more bikes. It is a fact of the densifying city. As a driver and rider I am doing my part to be more conscientious and aware of how to share the road.\nRemoving bike lanes is a enormous waste of money and almost certainly will lead to new fatalities. I would rather money be spent on a plan to licence cyclists and educate them in the rules of the road - so they can be as accountable and safety-minded as car drivers must be.\nDo we really want the congestion that will come when drivers and riders are disrupted -- again -- to un-build cycling infrastructure? In addition to the buyout of the Beer Store contract and the excessive and unnecessary costs of relocating the Ontario Science Centre, if the Government of Ontario seeks another banner project that signals waste of tax dollars -- this might do it.\nI also oppose the construction, disruption and cost of Hwy 413. Hwy 407 is already an east-west alternative to 401. It is almost empty whenever I use it. Spend money to buy it back for public non-toll use. This would avoid the destruction of farmlands and nature from building 413. It would avoid the massive greenhouse gas emissions generated when all that concrete would be manufactured.\nThe goals of this legislation may be laudable but the means are senseless.\n"
