The evidence based argument for keeping the lanes is overwhelming. It is better for the environs, economy and the citizens of Toronto. Other cities that have increased bike lane infrastructure have had great benefits from them.\nPlease do not touch the bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "As a life long resident and recently retired first responder I feel compelled to comment on this matter\nTHANK YOU to the provincial government of the day for imposing reason and logic into the equation\nI cringed daily as the bike advocates posted photos of police fire ambulances and delivery trucks parked to the left of the road way on the bike paths.Of course these vehicles were positioned to allow for the ONLY live line of traffic to get through .Yes they were impeding the bike path. Apparently the bike culture would have the afore mentioned service vehicles sit in the only lane for vehicular traffic rather than sit to the left of the roadway and have bikes go around them.Apparently their reserved lane and inflated sense of being is greater than the public good served by responders and even deliveries. How has this evolved into a such a mess ? how have we allowed cyclists to impose there will on the city to this extent?This is not Beijing where the entire city was developed around cyclists.Our reality is it snows.Its cold . The bike lanes are rendered useless.The cyclists are on the subways as the roadways are reduced to one lane in each direction.What an abomination. Create bike paths on boulevards between side walks and roadways   if space permits. Bike paths routes on secondary roads so our city can function for the greater good not to whims of the cycle lobby .Cyclists learn to follow rules of the road.\nThis government seems to have suddenly garnered common sense and will get my vote as they continue to make common sense decisions and are creating jobs in the process. Wake up city\n"

        "comment": "All cities need increased safe bicycle infrastructure. Proposing to remove existing ones and limit the further expansion of bike lanes is backwards, asinine, and will INCREASE gridlock, as has been proven time after time by studies around the world.\nThis is absurd stunt by the Ontario government (Ford in particular) and must be stopped. It's contrary to the the evidence that bicycle lanes reduce traffic, and are in every other way in the best interest of all citizens of Ontario.\nThe links to articles and studies below is just the very tip of the iceberg of overwhelming evidence for the increased adoption of bicycle lanes in cities.\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nThese bike lanes were only implemented recently? How can we decide whether these bike lanes have been ineffective only after a year or so? My main concern is how much will this cost to remove and replace? It seems like a waste of tax payer dollars to implement these bike lanes just to remove them shortly after. In effect, spending money to create absolutely nothing in actuality. This would have been a total waste of tax payer money.\nWarm regards,\nStephen\n"

        "comment": "The basis of this bill is a lie. There is no evidence that bike lanes cause more congestion. In fact on some parts of Bloor, bikes make up 37% of vehicle traffic despite taking up less than half of the space allocated to cars. This makes cycling a far more space efficient method of transport. Removing bike lanes will only push people from their bikes back into cars, creating more traffic. To effectively reduce traffic in a city as large as Toronto, the only way forward is more investment in alternative forms of transportation to cars, so that people who dont want to drive don't need to.\nIt is also an overreach of power for the provincial government to tell cities where they can or can't put bike lanes. The people of Toronto voted overwhelmingly against the mayoral candidates who opposed bike lanes, so it is clear what Torontonians want.\nLess bike lanes mean worse conditions for people cycling, and people WILL DIE. I hold this conservative government responsible for any deaths that occur as a result of the removed bike lanes.\nI hope you reconsider this bill, and allow cities all around Ontario to build safer and more efficient road infrastructure.\n"

        "comment": "I am completely against this proposal and would prefer the Province to focus on big picture solutions such as investing in rapid-transit and providing faster ways for people to commute around the GTA which reduce volumes and the road and be better for the environment overall. Bike usage has increased both out of convenience and for people trying to reduce costs in a very expensive economy. Removing bike lanes puts their safety risk - particularly at a time when we have seen numerous cyclists killed in recent months. I am exhausted at seeing policies that only prioritize vehicle owners and don't give thought to cyclists and pedestrians who also have to deal with increased congestion in our our neighbourhoods and reckless drivers. Furthermore I am really incensed at the Province continually getting involved in municipal politics instead of working on resolving the macro problems that affect this province.\n"

        "comment": "Even as a voter with centre to centre-right leanings living in suburban Toronto, removing bike lanes on major thoroughfares like Bloor and University, as well as curtailing municipalities ability to build new lanes, is absolutely asinine.\n1. Gridlock in Toronto cannot be alleviated with more car lanes. Induced demand is a well researched phenomenon that the government is likely aware of and willfully ignores in this situation. If the government is ignorant of induced demand, please follow the attached link.\n2. Ripping up bike lanes and paving them over is costly and time consuming. Lord knows construction projects in Ontario takes twice the time and cost as planned, and that is time businesses still recovering from economic downturn can ill afford. And when BIAs are complaining about the projected ill effects this move would have to businesses, I fail to see how the government is living up to its \"open for business\" catchphrase here.\n3. As a driver, I wholeheartedly support separated bike lanes. This ensures the safety of drivers and bikers alike, and I'm sure everyone is in favour of fewer lethal accidents.\n4. Good luck convincing any property owners on side streets to let the city build major biking thoroughfares through their neighbourhood. Practically, this will never work.\n5. As it stands, both driving and transit infrastructure are woefully inadequate to support the rapidly increasing population. Alternative methods like biking will certainly help gridlock at a cheap rate. We know the government is incapable of delivering transit infrastructure in a timely manner anyhow.\n6. Focus on provincial problems and let cities focus on municipal problems. Political conservatives are not a fan of government overreach!\nUltimately, bill 212 is poorly planned and utterly unhelpful. I would like for the government to focus its efforts on tackling much larger issues such as the housing crisis, unemployment, and a deteriorating healthcare system instead of wasting time and aggravating segments of its own voter base.\nThank you for reading and hope you have a nice day.\n"

        "comment": "This a a very disappointing proposal, bike lanes have greatly improved my family's experience living close to a main road in Toronto. I haven't noticed a great change in traffic due to the lanes, the main congestion issue comes from construction blocking traffic in my area regularly.\nThe lanes make for a much safer experience as a driver, pedestrian and biker!! As a regular driver on Bloor, Avenue and Yonge, I no longer have to worry about sharing the lane with vulnerable bikers. As a pedestrian, the extra buffer that the bike lanes provide makes walking with my family safer and more enjoyable. We no longer have speeding cars and trucks 3 feet from the crowded sidewalk. There were several instances of cars jumping the curb before the separated lanes were installed.\nI understand the need to try to improve commuting in the city, but this is a massive overreach for the province. There are other priorities that should be way ahead of this, ER wait times are something that my family has had to deal with, and would prefer millions of dollar to be spend towards doctors and nurses that removing infrastructure that was only completed this year!\nRemoving bike lanes is short sighted and will absolutely not improve commuting for everyone in this city, please reconsider this initiative.\n"

We should be taking pages out of the books of the greatest cities on earth, who maximize cycling and pedestrainism as much as possible.\nAs cost of living has risen over the past 5 years, I have ridden my bike more than ever due to the increase in fuel prices, to decrease my carbon footprint, and to enjoy the INCREASE in cycling infrastructure my city has provided. As a paramedic, I hate cars. They are unsafe, improperly used, and cause injury, illness, and are often dangerous objects or rage in high congestion.\nI do not think the Ontario Conservative Party represents my interests as a young proud Canadian.\nThanks!\n"
