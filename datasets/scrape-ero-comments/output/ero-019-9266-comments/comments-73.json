That area is protected land for a reason and fertile farmland is a rare and extremely precious commodity to Ontario and to the current and future populations. The negative impact of reducing agricultural land will be extreme, especially considering the current high food costs in Ontario. Our province should be able to produce as much fresh food as possible. It is in everyone's best interest, and for the economy as well.\nAlso, adding highways don't necessarily alleviate congestion in the long run, new roadways often attract more traffic. Investing in public transit, go trains and improving existing infrastructure may be much for beneficial for the long term.\n"

        "comment": "I stand strongly opposed to this bill.\nIt is truly baffling that in an attempt to relieve congestion the Ontario government is making it harder for its residents to take modes of transport that aren't driving a automotive vehicle. Congestion is mainly caused by driving being at times the only way or the most convenient method of transportation. We need investment in public transport, like the Ontario Line, and to make it easier and safer for one to walk or cycle. That is the only way to tackle gridlock. Making it easier for people to drive will only increase congestion as more and more people will continue to choose to drive.\nI expect my representatives to vote against Bill 212 as it goes against my and my fellow Ontarian's interests.\n"

        "comment": "This Bill does serve the majority of the public! It is to serve the 1% of the entitled who seem to have the loudest voices. The bike lanes serve a purpose of providing safe alternative mode of transportation and it SLOWS down traffic so it is safe for cyclists AND pedestrians. If the government hates the bike lanes so much, would they commit to reducing car travel lanes to give more space to create wider sidewalks and more trees for PEDESTRIAN safety?? If not, then it is clear that it is just an anti-bike campaign.\nI started to cycle to/from work since the Bloor Street bike lane was constructed. As a reference, I had not used cycling as a way to commute when I started my job at Bloor-Yonge in 2018. But since the construction of the Bloor bike lane that extended from High Park to Kipling, I have commuted by bike 1-3 times a week. It varies based on my work situation.\nIt also became a more reliable way of getting to work when there\u2019s disruption of service on Line 2 subway. If anything, the government should subsidize the bike share program so that it aligns with service disruption on TTC so that people can hop on a bike rather than have to suffer through shuttle buses or resorting to Uber.\n"

        "comment": "The proposal to create additional barriers to block the addition of bike lanes, or their outright removal is ridiculous.\nThere is a wealth of research showing adding bike lanes reduces congestion by offering better alternatives to driving. In contrast, the addition of more lanes to highways typically increases congestion by inducing more demand for drivers to use cars rather than lower impact alternative like biking and public transport.\nFurther, bike lanes save lives. This summer was the most deadly summer for cycling deaths in Toronto in years. Doug Ford himself went cycling with Jagmeet Singh in a television segment and acknowledged how much he appreciated not having to share a lane with traffic and felt much safer with dedicated bike lanes. Alternatively, when cyclists have to share a lane with cars, they slow the flow of traffic as vehicles have to wait for a safe opportunity to pass the cyclists. This scenario can be circumvented entirely by improving dedicated cycling infrastructure.\nAdditionally, promoting active transport methods like walking, cycling, or using public transit reduces greenhouse gas emissions in a two-fold manner. Commuters choosing to use active transport options reduces the total number of greenhouse gas emitting vehicles on the road, but also reduces congestion, allowing the remaining vehicles on the road to get where they want to go faster with less idling in traffic jams.\nA less talked about benefit to active transport alternatives is the opportunity for more people to get active. Currently, a minority of Canadian adults achieve the minimum recommended physical activity guidelines recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) to lead healthy lives. As we grapple with an obesity epidemic, weighing heavily on our healthcare system, reducing quality of life, and shortening life expectancies, encouraging Canadians to use active transport options like cycling can improve the lives of people across the country and reduce healthcare burden by preventing obesity and the many comorbidities commonly associated with the disease.\n"

I can confidently say that traffic and congestion has not become any worse since the bloor bike lanes have been installed, and may have even improved due to consistent lane sizes and lack of pinch points.\nI regularly use the bloor bike lanes to get around the city and would be devastated if they are removed. I live at an intersection on Bloor in bloordale. Cycling without those lanes would become extremely dangerous and difficult and create a poorer quality of life for those in the area.\n"

        "comment": "I noticed recently that there has been a lot of talk about removing bike lanes from already existing roads. I grew up in Scarborough, around Pharmacy and St Clair there used to be bike lanes, now these places are dangerous to cycle (https://toronto.citynews.ca/2024/09/09/cyclist-sent-to-hospital-after-b\u2026) As someone who commutes by bicycle via trails and protected bike lanes, I see firsthand how beneficial they are, whether they connect trails or are alongside city roads. The evidence supports bike lanes as a way to reduce traffic\nI am having difficulty understanding why our government would put forward legislation that does not align with the established science or data? Especially when bike lanes are under municipal jurisdiction.\nThe conservative government emphasizes making Ontario a more affordable place to live, cycling is by far the most affordable way to travel locally without worrying about insurance, gas, charging, or shelling out hundreds of dollars a year on maintenance. I am confused as to why we would make this affordable means of transportation less accessible in a climate where the cost of living is increasing so quickly.\nIn my area I see all age demographics biking in protected bike lanes (families, older adults, kids, yours truly) and removing protected bike lanes will put us all at risk. Motorists are at risk of killing or injuring someone and cyclists are at risk of dying. Those who do not feel safe on a bike as a result of this will not only be forced to spend more money on other transit, see their health and freedom of mobility decline, and become one more car on the road contributing to traffic.\nWhy is our government choosing to overreach regarding this issue, when experts say that bike lanes are a positive thing for communities? I have seen the impact that unsafe streets can have on a community, that same stretch of road I grew up on has seen 3 pedestrian/cyclist deaths, and we are seeing cyclist deaths in our communities. Please don't make my life more dangerous, I love to cycle, I love to be outside, I love to see young people granted the freedom to feel safe exercising and visiting their friends.\n"

        "comment": "We support bike lines.\nWe know from evidence that bike lanes help to:\n- reduce gridlock\n- reduce greenhouse gases\n- get people moving faster\nBike lanes are not just a matter of convenience; they are vital for many residents who rely on affordable transportation options. Delivery drivers, including those in food and courier services, as well as individuals who simply cannot afford vehicles due to the high cost of living, depend on both public transportation and bike lanes to move around the city. The rising cost of living has made car ownership unattainable for many, further highlighting the need for equitable, accessible alternatives like cycling infrastructure.\nWe must also recognize that traffic congestion is self-perpetuating. More cars on the road lead to more traffic. It\u2019s a cycle that anyone who takes a moment to reflect on the situation would easily understand. Expanding bike lanes offers an opportunity to break this cycle by encouraging more people to use alternative modes of transport, thereby reducing overall congestion and improving the flow of traffic for everyone.\nInvesting in safe, accessible bike infrastructure is essential for the health, safety, and well-being of our communities, as well as for addressing the city\u2019s pressing environmental and transportation challenges. These actions are not only distractions from the real needs of our city but also betray a lack of vision and leadership when it comes to addressing urban challenges. Bike lanes are a practical, immediate step that can provide tangible benefits for Toronto residents, but we need all levels of government working together, in good faith, to make them a reality.\nWe need a government that supports making decisions that are based in evidence.\nM5J 2c2\n"

Taking away crucial infrastructure such as this is taking us backwards, not forwards.

        "comment": "I am a Torontonian. I live in the city and will hopefully live here for the rest of my life. I own a car, a bicycle and a Presto pass. I also do not like waiting any longer than I need to for any journey so I think it is imperative that the province understand how road and traffic management works by consulting professional traffic engineers and studying real world examples of how traffic decongestion was achieved. The spoiler here is: it was never achieved by adding more car lanes. Please read and consider the below, information like this is abundantly available everywhere:\nTraffic congestion is a complex issue that cannot be solved merely by adding more car lanes. In fact, this approach often leads to what is known as **induced demand**, where increasing road capacity encourages more people to drive, ultimately resulting in the same or worse congestion levels. This phenomenon occurs because more lanes can lead to increased vehicle speeds, which in turn attracts additional drivers who might have previously opted for alternative modes of transport or avoided traveling during peak hours[1][4].\n## Limitations of Expanding Car Lanes\n1. **Frequent Intersections**: Roads are typically unable to reach their full capacity due to frequent intersections, traffic signals, and merging lanes. These factors create bottlenecks that negate the benefits of additional lanes[2][4].\n2. **Environmental Impact**: Expanding roadways contributes to urban sprawl and increases pollution levels, which are significant concerns in urban planning[1].\n3. **Cost Ineffectiveness**: Building new lanes or expanding existing ones is often more expensive than investing in alternative transportation infrastructure like cycling lanes or public transit systems[1][4].\n## Importance of Cycling Lanes\nTo alleviate congestion effectively, cities must prioritize the development of cycling infrastructure. This approach not only promotes safer passage for cyclists but also encourages a shift away from car dependency. Here are some reasons why cycling lanes are imperative:\n1. **Encouraging Alternative Transportation**: More cycling lanes can lead to increased bike usage, reducing the number of cars on the road. Cities like Copenhagen and Amsterdam have successfully integrated extensive cycling networks, resulting in lower traffic congestion and improved air quality[1][2].\n2. **Safety Improvements**: Dedicated bike lanes enhance safety for cyclists by providing them with a separate space from motor vehicles, reducing accidents and encouraging more people to cycle[4][5].\n3. **Cost-Effectiveness**: Investing in cycling infrastructure is generally cheaper than expanding roadways. For example, a study found that building bike lanes costs significantly less per mile than constructing new roads[1][3].\n## Real-World Examples\nCities that have successfully reduced traffic congestion through increased cycling infrastructure include:\n- **Copenhagen, Denmark**: The city has invested heavily in biking infrastructure, resulting in over 60% of residents commuting by bike daily. This has led to a noticeable decrease in car traffic and congestion[2][4].\n- **Portland, Oregon**: By implementing a network of bike lanes and promoting cycling as a viable mode of transport, Portland has seen a significant increase in bike ridership while simultaneously reducing vehicle traffic during peak hours[3][4].\n## Cost-Effective Strategies for Reducing Congestion\nTo move people rather than cars, cities can adopt several cost-effective strategies:\n1. **Implementing Road Diets**: This involves reducing the number of lanes for cars while reallocating space for cyclists and pedestrians. This strategy has been shown to improve safety and reduce speeds without significantly impacting vehicle flow[2][3].\n2. **Enhancing Public Transit Options**: Improving public transportation can encourage people to leave their cars at home, thus reducing congestion on roads.\n3. **Smart Traffic Management Systems**: Utilizing technology to optimize traffic signals and manage traffic flow can help reduce bottlenecks without the need for physical road expansion[4][5].\nIn conclusion, while adding more car lanes may seem like an immediate solution to traffic congestion, it often exacerbates the problem. Prioritizing cycling infrastructure not only enhances safety but also promotes sustainable urban mobility, ultimately leading to reduced congestion and improved quality of life in urban areas.\nCitations:\n[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_transportation_planning_and_engin\u2026\n[2] https://nacto.org/publication/urban-bikeway-design-guide/bike-lanes/\n[3] https://bicycleinfrastructuremanuals.com/manuals2/Bikeways%20Design%20M\u2026\n[4] https://www.tomesoftware.com/the-bike-lane-newsletter/a-traffic-enginee\u2026\n[5] https://bicycleinfrastructuremanuals.com/manuals5/Ministry-of-Transport\u2026\n[6] https://www.ite.org/technical-resources/topics/complete-streets/bicycle\u2026\n[7] https://www.reddit.com/r/civilengineering/comments/1cqsa9s/can_traffic_\u2026\n[8] https://www.canadianconsultingengineer.com/features/space-for-bikeways/\n"
