        "comment": "In my life I have travelled to countries and cities where the quality of life and health has been measured to be outstanding.  These places nearly all  have incredible bike infrastructure. On a bike, we are moving our bodies, we can see each other and interact. With e-bikes even people who physically could not before have an opportunity to move this way. Building a city that supports alternative ways to moving is better for the environment, our healthcare system and our mental health. Let's think about the future, about how the next generation wants to live and thrive. Please Doug Ford stop getting involved with the details of Toronto.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are crucial for people without vehicles and consistently keep roads safer. Bikers keep drivers aware and ensure they are consistently watching for pedestrians. You would not be helping the people by making it harder for cities to have bike lanes. Doug the car salesman is obsessed with cars and needs to reevaluate his bias. More roads do not help either. If we really wanted to help reduce cars build better trains. Imagine how much less congested these roads were if there were a bullet train like the one in Japan even from Ottawa to Toronto. The time, fuel and money saved are worth considering. Also, why would the government want more paperwork? The money and time that would be wasted on needing to request to put in bike lanes is ridiculous and bureaucratic red tape. The downfall of Ontario is evident when time and resources are being wasted so openly. It\u2019s hard not to see this as anything other than an attack on the lower class.\n"

        "comment": "Everything about the Bill is braindead. Incentivizing other forms of transit (like bicycles and public transit) is the only data driven method for reducing congestion. Anyone who says that they can reduce gridlock by simply removing bike lanes that they (almost exclusively drivers) don't like is either ignorant of the mountains of research that exists, lying through their teeth, or just pandering for votes. Every Ontario citizen would agree that traffic congestion needs to be addressed. Why don't we dispense with the BS and actually explore data driven solutions (eg. incentivizing people to use alternative and more efficient modes of travel, like public transit) that will actually address the problem. I'm sick of politicians who only offer rage and lies as remedies for real problems.\nAdditionally, this is a ridiculous example of Provincial overreach. If the Premier wants to design Toronto's streets so much, why doesn't he try running for mayor. Leave the design of local streets to the municipalities.\n"

        "comment": "I am disappointed by the province creating more red tape for cities to cater to their populations. The province should stick to managing provincial problems rather than telling municipalities what to do. Biking is a healthier, greener, and more cost-efficient way to get around the city and we should be supporting these developments rather than hindering them.\n"

This proposal is dangerous to the lives of commuters, just because they choose to bike does not mean they should be punished for not driving a car. Furthermore, bike lanes should be left up to the jurisdiction of the municipality; with this bill the Province is interfering with the order of Canadian governing and sticking its nose where it is not wanted.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is a Bad idea. This bill will make the right lanes automatic bike lanes, as per the Law. Bicycles are vehicles so they will just take up more traffic space. The bill also allows Highway 413 to be built unobstructed, an idea that while not idea, if built as a ring road and then development is densified, would make sense. Removing bike lanes in an already sprawling and congested city is asking for more cyclist deaths and worse traffic. Not to mention the cost. Toronto is attempting to make the quality of life of its residents improve. This bill would go against the local needs of Torontonians. I recommend the entire legislature cycle to work on roads without bike lanes, then on roads with bike lanes to understand the magnitude of the effect they have. 1800 cars off the road per day on Bloor is a standard number during the summer, in one direction. Since most cars are on average 3-4 metres long, generous for a truck, that is between about 5 and 7 km of traffic removed per day on Bloor alone, reducing pollution and thus reducing health impacts, reducing the load on healthcare. Citizens can choose how they get to work and school. In winter, even if it is colder, cycling keeps you warm and the bike lanes are cleared of snow, unlike combined bike and car lanes, which are covered in snow and slush, making them much more dangerous.\n"

Province sticking its fingers into our municipal politics while we cant even get family doctors.\nThis helps no one, widening roads has never worked here to solve traffic look at the 401, the widest highway in North America, not solving traffic. If Ontario plan to solve congestion is more cars in a growing population then I see no hope here, moving away will absolutely be in the cards.\n"

        "comment": "This is a regressive policy.  Individual communities should be making these decisions on a local basis, not being dictated by the Province.  The provinces role is to provide guidelines for road design so they are consistent across the province, but getting involved in the local choice of specific road types is assuming at best.  Please stay in your lane and allow local taxpayers to make the choice of what infrastructure serves the community best.\nAdditionally, rolling back already made changes is a horrific waste of MY tax dollars, how dare you waste this.\n"

        "comment": "There is no data to back-up the claim that bike lanes cause congestion. Cars cause congestion, and the more people out of cars the better.\nBike lanes are also shown to support commerce on streets, two studies below state this, and it was seen on Montreal's Cristoph Colombe.\nMore bike lanes = more bikers = less traffic. Studies show this.\nI have seen this in Toronto, Montreal, Paris, NYC. I have biked in all of these cities before and after increase of bike lanes. and there are far more cyclists on the street after the infrastructure is creaeted.\nThey may not be filled 100% of the time. but the same is true with roads.\nI grew up in Toronto, and now live in Ottawa. Ottawa is terrifying to bike in, and people here don't want to do so, and choose cars, because it's so unsafe. Bike lanes disappear at dangerous intersections, are inconsistent, drivers assume no one's on them, and you can't safely get from point A to B on a bike. I do it for 8 months of the year and find it terrifying.\nToronto is so much safer, and the safer and better the bike lanes are, the more people will choose a bike over a car, which will decrease traffic.\nThis legislation will ruin cities, cost lives, and increase our contribution to climate change\u2014an issue the Ford government just lost a class action on (Mather et al).\nThere is no data that this legislation will improve gridlock, but it will kill citizens. I implore you to not only keep, but add more bike lanes in cities, and see what happens. look at Montreal for example, which is increasing bike lanes every year, and paving them in the winter. The city has awful street parking, a great metro, incredible bike lanes, and less gridlock than Toronto and Ottawa.\n\"In Toronto, the city recently released a report looking at a section of the Bloor West thoroughfare where it installed bike lanes and other measures to make the area more cyclist- and pedestrian-friendly. It compared traffic from a period before the lanes were added, November 2022 to March 2023, with the same period one year later, and found \"average increases in motor vehicle times ... from 2.4 to 4.4 minutes eastbound and 1.5 to 3.6 minutes westbound for travel between Runnymede Road and Aberfoyle Crescent, depending on the time of day and the direction of travel.\"\n\"For example, in New York City, the authors shared figures from the city's transportation department that showed in 2010, before bike lanes were installed on a major midtown thoroughfare, it took the average car 4.5 minutes to travel from 96th Street to 77th Street. After the bike lanes were installed, it took just three minutes \u2014 a 35 per cent decrease. One of the reasons they cited for the change was the installation of a left-turn lane, which not only kept cyclists moving but also stopped cars from holding up traffic.\" - CBC Oct 22, 2024\n"

        "comment": "The province should not be interfering in municipal matters. And if it does it should not be interfering in such an uninformed manner. Every study shows that bike lanes reduce congestion by taking drivers off the road. Cities should be left to maintain and build bike lanes as is appropriate for the travel needs of their residents. Any removal of bike lanes will increase congestion and danger for those that have no choice but continue to cycle. Cars are a lot more expensive than bicycles and many cyclists will have to continue to cycle to work or as delivery people and they will be put in danger. But beyond that - it won't actually reduce congestion. This is clearly a publicity stunt to pander to suburban voters, and it should end immediately.\n"

Safer bike lanes will encourage able bodied people to use bike lanes more, which then reduces the amount of people reliant on vehicles.\nIt has been proven in planning studies that adding an extra lane of traffic does not solve the vehicular traffic issue, rather encouraging people to use alternative modes of transportation does.\n"

I don\u2019t have the financial resources for a car so bike is my means of transportation. Due to housing being unaffordable in Toronto I am forced to ride my bike as means of travel.\nThis bill is threatening to take away my safety.\nFord mentions they will be looking at data, however, has announced roads he wants to rip up bike lanes on, without even announcing cirtea that will measure what bike lanes will qualify for removal. The whole thing is shady, I don\u2019t trust their process.\nStudies done in holland show a 800 percent roi in bike lanes and a build it they will come strategy. It\u2019s unfortunate that ford is over stepping what the people of Toronto want and he\u2019s putting lives in danger.\nIf they remove the bike lanes on Bloor, people will still bike on bloor, leading to more congestion then there is currently And more deaths\nI\u2019m a disgusted at the ford government for this\n"
