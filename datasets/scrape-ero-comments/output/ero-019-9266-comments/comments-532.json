This project threatens Ontario\u2019s environment by cutting through protected green spaces, farmlands, and wildlife habitats\u2014undermining biodiversity and climate goals. The highway also promotes urban sprawl and car dependency, diverting funds from more sustainable options like public transit.\nI\u2019m also particularly concerned about the potential removal of bike lanes, which are vital for sustainable transportation and healthier communities. Investments in active transportation should be prioritized, not sacrificed. I urge reconsideration of this project in favour of solutions that better align with Ontario\u2019s environmental and social priorities.\n"

        "comment": "I am, variously, a pedestrian, cyclist, TTC user, and driver in Toronto.  I wholeheartedly support bike lanes in all of those capacities. When I\u2019m on my bike, the bike lanes obviously make my trip easier and safer. As both a pedestrian and driver, the bike lanes also make my trips easier and safer by segregating the cyclists from other traffic and creating predictability for everyone as to where the cyclists will be. The bike lanes make my travel easier, safer, and more efficient by whatever means I\u2019m travelling.\nRemoving existing bike lanes will make travel less safe, less easy, less efficient - and less safe for everyone. Doing so will also be an absurd way to spend tax dollars, wasting the money already invested in creating the lanes and the money it will cost to remove them.\nI am strongly opposed to removing any bike lanes and strongly oppose tax dollars being used this way.\n"

        "comment": "As a Torontonian who relies on all modes of transportation\u2014car, public transit, and bicycle\u2014I strongly oppose the removal of any bike lanes and believe our city needs even more of them. Removing bike lanes is a waste of taxpayers' money. Bike lanes reduce traffic congestion by offering a safe alternative for more people to choose cycling, easing the load on our overcrowded streets. Adding another car lane will not solve our congestion issues; what we need are more people on bikes and more public transit options.\nLiving on the subway line, I experience firsthand the challenges of getting on the subway during rush hour. Cyclists help relieve this pressure, and instead of prioritizing more space for cars, the government should focus on building a more robust public transit system and cycling infrastructure. Toronto deserves to grow as the world-class city it is, and that means investing in sustainable transportation solutions that benefit everyone.\n"

        "comment": "I think this plan is crazy for many reasons:\n1. Why is the premier fiddling around with things that are in a common-sense way the purview of the cities?\n2. There are stats being thrown around that 1% of commuters shouldn't make traffic worse for the majority.  They are highly misleading.  If you look at the amount of infrastructure devoted to cars vs bikes, it's obvious why more people commute by car.  However, where there is decent infrastructure, there are a decent number of biking commuters.\n3. Cars as a transportation mechanism do not scale.  Cars simply take too much space per person to be a long term solution to traffic.  If you want a long term solution to traffic, making driving alternatives viable.  Then only people who want to drive will drive.  Which leads to...\n4. Many drivers which they didn't have to drive.  Bike lane networks are woefully disconnected outside of the downtown core.  Subways are overcrowded during peak times.  Many drivers don't feel like they have a choice.  Give them a choice and they will choose not to drive, lessening traffic for those who do drive.\n"

As a citizen of the province who uses a bicycle in Toronto for my main transportation, I strongly reject this plan.\nIf the concern is that traffic is being hampered by the present bike lanes, rather than waste money removing newly built infrastructure, why not begin building the alternative bike lanes first?\nThis is not only poor infrastructure planning but the way in which it has been communicated uses divide and conquer politics pitting citizens against one another.\nVery disappointing, the usual steps that lead to a government\u2019s decline. Just concentrate on a practical solution. Build the alternative to solve the problem. Give cyclists a safe route and then tackle vehicle roadways.\n"

        "comment": "Reducing the number of bike lanes will not improve car traffic congestion! I will personally continue to use my bike on the shortest path to any destination, riding it in a vehicular traffic lane, regardless of any changes to remove bike lanes. Because my top speed is much lower than that of a car, I will be increasing commute time for all the cars around me! The numerous delivery bikers will do the same, out of the necessity of earning a living. The traffic delays that will be caused by increased biker deaths and injuries from vehicular collisions will be significant! Even if we disregard the tragic loss of life, the proposed changes will not accomplish their main goal of reducing gridlock!\nI propose we scrap these changes and encourage the construction of even more safe biking infrastructure. Let\u2019s get cars off the road and more people on bikes to reduce \u201clast mile\u201d public transit commute issues. Continuous and safe biking infrastructure is an easy way to accomplish this.\n"

My children use the bike lanes to visit friends, shop along Bloor St. and even to get to their job.  Both my husband and I cycle to work, myself for 3/4 of the year, my partner even cycles downtown through the winter.  We, all five of us, rely on the bike lanes for our health and safety. While we prefer cycling because of it's impact on our health, the health of our planet, and it's ease of transport, we do also use our car for longer trips and/or errands like the grocery store.  While we have noticed a small uptick in the length of our travel time, it is a matter of minutes, not hours.  This seems to be a small concession when one looks at the improved statistics around traffic incidents, including fewer pedestrian, cyclist and motorist events. I strongly encourage you to reconsider the effects of taking out the Bloor West bicycle lanes, as the few saved moments of vehicular travel returned by adding in a second car lane are not worth the accidents and fatalities added back as well.\nThank you for your attention in this matter.\n"

        "comment": "Mr. Premier, I am an older adult, taxpayer and voter who has come to rely on cycling as the most convenient and inexpensive transportation for my neighbourhood. Bike lanes on main routes including those named in Bill 212 for removal have become essential to my safety, daily work and shopping. Pushing through the bill as written signals to me that you and your government don't really care about wasting taxpayers' money, increasing bureaucracy, hurting local businesses, increasing driving times, and risking the lives of cyclists and pedestrians like me. I am especially concerned about your seeming disregard for the physical risk to families, young people and children, older people and hard-working voters who rely on bike lanes every day for safe and economical transportation.\nThese are the detailed reasons why: (1) For example, the Toronto bikes lanes on Yonge, University Ave and Bloor have opened up a world of local businesses we can easily visit by bike that are too difficult to access by car, transit or on foot. By removing these and other lanes, Mr. Premier, you are removing our patronage from those businesses. (2) Working bike infrastructure has been installed at great effort and by tearing it out, your government will cost taxpayers and local businesses a lot of money and lost revenue. (3) By removing the bike lanes, your government will push us into cars, taxis and overcrowded transit along the routes, or force us to bike in traffic, all of which will further clog roads and the TTC. (4) The named bike lanes and others have been critical for making these routes safe for the first time for cyclists and they *encourage safer driving* that also saves pedestrians from harm. Ontario is already so far behind other jurisdictions in providing a network for safe biking and walking--and Bill 212 is a costly regression. (5) The bike lanes on University Ave have opened easy, safe access to 'hospital row' where I and other older adults must frequent--why is your government adding barriers to my access to health care? (6) By adding a new layer of provincial overlording over decisions that are easiest and most accountably made at the municipal level, your government will make bureaucratic action slower and more expensive, and will \"chill\" the installation of critical bike infrastructure that prevents injury and death.\nMr. Premier, you already abundantly made your point about keeping drivers and people moving without this outright counterproductive legislation that I believe will bring real harms to the taxpayers and voters your government is alleging to help. Toronto's streets are already past capacity with cars, so the solution to getting around is *not* your empty and costly gestures like thwarting bike lanes. Instead, you should focus 110% on forward-thinking smart investments in transportation that complement cars. Thank you for the opportunity to comment--however, it's a crying shame and waste of my money that your government is fast-tracking such an ill-considered bill.\n"

        "comment": "This bill enacts a death wish on cyclists. Anyone supporting this bill clearly does not believe that the lives of cyclist have any value, and you would rather see us dead under your cars than allow us to traverse the city with ease.\nI found freedom when I started cycling. Through cycling I can get from East York to Etobicoke faster than the ttc, faster than your cars during rush hour. I\u2019m able to visit more Toronto businesses, and attend more Toronto events. I\u2019m able to enjoy the green spaces of our city and I see a new side of Toronto that is inaccessible if I drove a car.\nStop prioritizing cars in a city setting. There are buses and street cars for a reason. There should be bike lanes for the same reasons. It\u2019s better environmentally, it\u2019s safer for residents, and it keeps our streets clear of congested traffic and street parking. More bikes means less traffic. Less street parking means less traffic. Less cars means a healthier city.\n"

I know Mr. Ford is a Toronto resident and has a personal interest, but this should not be a political football or become a victim of the notwithstanding clause. Cyclists need the protection of bike lanes.  I am not a Toronto resident, but I don't see the sense in ripping out existing infrastructure, and I object to my municipality and those around me having to ask the province for permission to add or augment existing cycling infrastructure. Making cyclists \"second class citizens\" on the roads is a dangerous paradigm, and will contribute to more cyclists being targeted by drivers, as has happened recently in Dundas. As a cyclist myself, this makes me angry, considering the fact that there were no serious repercussions for the driver in this incident. I know that when I am on my bike I am more vulnerable than those in cars. I think having protected bike lanes reminds our car drivers of this fact.\n"

        "comment": "This is an undemocratic, overbearing decision. Where is the legislation to block the condo developers from taking up lanes and blocking traffic from their trucks--a constant in Toronto. The Ontario Line has taken out a lane on the Danforth and elsewhere throughout the city. Why isn't the Eglinton line running? Where is the anger and legislation to lessen the people driving in the core, why not legislation to cut the number of delivery trucks and construction vehicles that spew toxic fumes into our air? Focusing on cyclists as the problem for traffic is dangerous to cyclists--both in promoting more resentment and hostility from drivers and to the bodily injury to cyclists that will happen when the lanes are removed. As a driver I appreciate that cyclists have their own lane so that I don't need to be constantly checking for and swerving around them in our tight city roads. As a cyclist I feel SAFE riding when there are designated bike lanes. We still need to ride along the major roads. Do you think cyclists don't need to go down those corridors--like we live in an alternate reality? Now we will have to ride in danger.\nThis autocratic legislation is disgusting.\n"

Urban bike lanes relieve traffic congestion, as proven in many international case studies: New York City, London and Paris have transformed and improved urban grid lock with intelligent urban planning. Join the world or retreat into your niche. It is unfortunate that the Province is choosing to spend its time and money in these ill considered initiatives which appear to stick it to urban constituents who apparently have voted against them (Ontario Place, Science Centre, etc), rather than signalling to the country and the world that we are a progressive, dynamic place interested in attracting business and investment.\n"
