        "comment": "I use the bike lanes in Toronto every day. I remember cycling the same routes before bike lanes were added, and I feel much safer in a separated bike lane than I do taking the lane.\nI disagree profoundly with this Bill. There is no evidence that it will do what it purports to do (that is, get cars moving more efficiently). Cycling is by far the most efficient way to travel around the city of Toronto, and easing traffic congestion is about giving people more transportation options, not fewer. Much has been made of the fact that bikes frequently represent fewer cars on the road; this point obscures the truth that many of us cannot now, nor have ever been able to, afford to run and park a car in the city (especially now that cost-of-living increases over the past few years are biting hard.) Cyclists are more vulnerable than drivers when travelling (we're not encased in mobile steel boxes) and we need and deserve the protection that bike lane infrastructure affords.\nCycling is good for the environment, good for public and personal health, and good for local businesses, whether they rely on foot traffic or bike delivery services.\nFurthermore, Bill 212 represents significant provincial overreach and ignores the fact that municipalities are in a far better position to determine the needs of the people who reside in them. On November 14, 2024, Toronto City Council passed a motion expressing opposition to \"proposed amendments to Part XII of the Highway Traffic Act contained in Bill 212, and any related proposed regulations, both of which contradict the stated purpose of the City of Toronto Act, 2006, to allow the City to determine what is in the public interest of the city.\"\n"

        "comment": "The bike lanes have made it a safe way for me to travel to work from the west end (near High Park) to Toronto General Hospital downtown via Bloor and then University avenue.  The bike lanes along those routes have made a world of difference in how safe I feel and I am so appreciative of them.  I also often stop along the way home to pick up items for dinner, either ready made food or ingredients.  I have shopped at a lot more businesses as a result as when on the subway I did not know a lot of these businesses existed.  The simple fact that we have a dedicated bike lane  will entice more people to use cycling as a mode of transport.  These routes are also along subway lines so there really is no need for cars at all along these routes as we have options.  To spend money on removing these lanes and to ignore the data surrounding bike lanes would be gross violation of trust.  Ancedotal stories from drivers are not data.  I work on \"hospital row\" and I see traffic moving easily and cyclists moving safely. Any extra money should be spent on infill housing to house people in this city, not to destroy infrastructure that improves the quality of life for its citizens.  As we become a more dense city, we, like other major international cities, will need to move away from a car culture and focus on better ways of getting around that allows interaction with our city and the people and businesses around us.  There are world class cities who do not rely on cars choking up their streets and if we want to be compared to them we will need to move in that direction. The bike lanes improve health, allow us to integrate in our city more readily and reduce smog. Perhaps instead of punishing those of us who live, work and move around in this city, take a harder look at the things like uber and lyft, what are those numbers of drivers doing to the congestion, how many come into our city every day, what is this doing to the loss of funding and ridership on public transit.  Lets have real data, out in the open and make evidence base decisions.\nThe province needs to focus on bigger issues like healthcare, housing and education and allow the cities to run themselves in terms of infrastructure. Allow those of us who live, work and play in our cities to make the decisions that will impact our day to day life and the safety of ourselves and our children.\n"

        "comment": "I used to think that biking in Toronto was too dangerous because for many years after I moved here from another province, there wasn't any good biking infrastructure. I only recently started commuting by bike because I found there to be a safe bike path network between my home and workplace downtown. I have had so many benefits from bike commuting including increased exercise, reduced commute time, and more flexibility with my travel within the city. Now that I enjoy commuting by bike, I will not stop. If bike lanes I removed I will be forced to bike within a car lane. Because of this Bill 212 will not solve congestion and will put lives at risk. Please do not remove bike lanes!\n"

        "comment": "Municipalities are best equipped to make local transportation decisions, especially when it comes to cycling infrastructure. Change takes time, and while there are sometimes challenging impacts immediately following bike lane implementation, the long term gains are worth some short term pains.\nWe know that bike lanes improve safety, and over time they will improve congestion as well. Without safe active transportation options, people will continue to drive and more will switch to driving (from cycling or transit), and further clog the streets. Much of the congestion today is caused by construction projects, which are also part of working towards longer term benefits, like high order public transit. If we give up now and give space only to motor vehicles, congestion will never improve.\nEnvironmental Assessments are critical to major highway proposals. The destruction of farmland and natural environments by the proposed Highway 413 would not only destroy habitats but also contribute to food insecurity and damage our agricultural economy.\nI urge you to stop this Bill from moving forward.\n"

What do you have against cyclists!? They get in the way of your personal monster truck or some such!? MAYBE instead of shutting down bike lanes start cycling yourself and you could get to work faster.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my opposition to proposed legislation (Bill 212) to restrict the installation of bicycle lanes where motor vehicle lanes would be removed, as well as the removal of several protected bicycle lanes in Toronto.\nIt is well understood in the field of urban planning that increasing road capacity does not improve congestion due to induced demand (1).  The most effective way to reduce congestion is to provide viable alternatives to driving.  By removing and limiting protected bicycle infrastructure on main streets that provide direct routes and easy access to destinations, the Ontario government will fail to improve traffic flow by reducing the viability of cycling as a mode of transport.\nPlacing bicycle infrastructure on secondary streets will limit access to local businesses located along main streets, depriving these businesses of the economic benefits of cycling activity.  Studies have found that visitors to Bloor St. spent more money following the installation of bike lanes in 2016, and that individuals in North American cities (including Toronto) spend more money in commercial areas when they arrive by foot or bicycle than by car (2,3).  In New York City, retail sales increased along commercial corridors after the installation of bike lanes (4).\nAdditionally, placing bicycle routes on secondary streets results in less direct routes and limited access to destinations, reducing convenience for individuals travelling by bicycle.  Therefore, individuals travelling by bicycle will likely continue to use main streets \u2013 only without the separation and protection provided by bicycle lanes.  As a result of this, cyclists will travel among motor vehicles and will be at an increased risk of injury and death, while potentially slowing motor vehicle traffic.  In Canada, 73% of deaths by cycling collisions involve a collision with a motor vehicle (5).  By removing bicycle infrastructure on major corridors, the Ontario government will be directly responsible for increased injuries and fatalities on these routes.\nI urge the government to reconsider this legislation and to allow municipalities to decide themselves where bicycle infrastructure is needed.\nReferences\n1.\tSpeck, J.

        "comment": "Every time I pass a white memorial bicycle, I heartbroken by the loss of life. Drivers don't see bikes unless they are allocated safe passage by infrastructure. Premier Ford, bikes don't hold up traffic, the city just can't accommodate all these cars. Condo density, and historically myopic urban planning has led to impossible density. Better transit and cycling infrastructure can help resolve this. Tearing out bike lanes and limiting their implementation is really poor choice. Many drivers are aggressive and impatient and distracted by their phones and screens, both on streets with bike lanes and without. We need our bike lanes. Protect cyclists from aggressive and distracted drivers please. We don't need more death or trauma from accidents between cyclists and distracted drivers.\nAs a cyclist, the amount of drivers I see on cell phones is terrifying. Drivers do not look at the road. Solve this problem first please with better road checks and policing of drivers. Speeding is another issue that is widespread. The recent death of a bistander on Annette was an example of the absurd speeding in residential and high pedestrian traffic areas. Solve this problem first.\nImpaired driving is also still an issue. Why are there so few arrests considering the statistics of impaired driving. Please solve this problem first before you blame cyclists for the terrible driving congestion. You could eliminate so many drivers from the road if you just demerit the heck out of all the rule infraction happening, like drivers speeding up and through yellow lights and rolling stops at stoplights. It is absurd. Don't blame cyclists for congestion. There are so many reasons for the congestion. Cycling lanes are an excellent alternative for commuting with kids. I take my children through Toronto streets safely using bike lanes. We have a cargo bike. We have a terrific opportunity to maintain and improve bike infrastructure. Please consider that many people use these bike lanes.\nPremier Ford, six people riding bikes have been killed on Toronto\u2019s streets in 2024 alone\u2014more than in the previous three years combined. Every death is a family\u2019s unbearable loss, and each new tragedy reopens old wounds for those who have already suffered. You need to look at the bigger picture.\nPlease drop Bill 212. Our roads should be safe for everyone. Not just car commuters.\nJulian, Bloor West.\n"

As a young professional and primary resident of the downtown core who does not own a car, bike lanes are the only alternative I have to walking that provide a safe means of transit around the city. Not only that, but bike lanes have been essential to my communities ability to navigate the city in an affordable way that also allows for necessary and healthy exercise. I am appalled by this Bill and its attempt to eradicate accessible transit around the city. Removing bike lanes will not fix traffic, and the population that is supposed to be benefited by passing this bill does not include all Ontarians. As an Ontarian, I call for the opposition of this bill and ask the Government of Ontario to focus on more pressing issues, for example transit accessibility.\n"

I bike commuted for years without bike lanes and was only doored once tho had many close calls. With the new bike lanes I feel much safer cycling and have had far fewer close calls.\nThe wastefulness of the expense of undoing the expense we have already gone too to improve our chances of limiting climate warming is fiscally irresponsible and now what I would expect from a conservative government.

        "comment": "This Provincial government promotes data-driven decision-making and cutting red tape, yet does precisely the opposite with its proposed Bike Lane Framework, which finds its justification in the personal anecdotes of the Minister of Transportation and a minority of loud, organized drivers, and represents one of the most flagrant instances of provincial overreach on municipal matters in recent history. It is no surprise that it has now been opposed by all major professional planning associations and organizations in Ontario. Given that the innumerable reasons for why this legislation should not pass have already been elucidated by experts across the Province, I will attempt to distill them here in the form of four unavoidable truths that this legislation denies, creating havoc that will be left for future generations to solve:\n1. More space for cars will never solve congestion, it will only make it worse. In doing so, it will waste more of everyone's time, including those that currently drive.\n2. Our urban populations are growing, but our road space is not. Those moving into our cities will need space-efficient mobility options if we want to avoid gridlock.\n3. Our planet is warming with catastrophic consequences, and our auto-oriented transportation system is a major cause. Continuing to promote automobility is irreconcilable with creating a livable planet.\n4. Automobility kills at astronomical rates.  When infrastructure that provides protection from cars is taken away, more people will die.\n"
