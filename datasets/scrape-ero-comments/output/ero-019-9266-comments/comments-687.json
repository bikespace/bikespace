Their removal would be a huge waste of resources. It's faulty to think that this would improve gridlock in the downtown core. People live in these neighbourhoods, they're more than just roads for suburban residents (who don't pay Toronto taxes), to get to the downtown core. The bike lanes are very utilized, especially the ones on Bloor.\n"

        "comment": "Two things stand out for me in this discussion - both revolve around the way different governments behave.  The third is logic.\n1. The city spent years consulting with residents and the process went through two mayors and a different council make up where sensible policies finally are taking the place of backroom deals.  This work cannot and should not be undone because some privileged folks make noise to an autocratic leader that overrides all of the work and process.  I think that those who disagree need to go through the same process of consultations and bridge building between communities.  We do not live in a dictatorship. (I know that constitutionally the province has a right to override city decisions - that needs to be updated - and doesn't give the right to meddle and micromanage city decisions.)\n2. Off the cuff decision making to placate the base is getting humans in trouble all over the world - it has got to stop.  Sure some folks disagree and are inconvenienced by  the very idea of bike lanes (I know some and they have no real argument except for 'feelings') - many others are inconvenienced (and have been injured/killed) by drivers and we've accepted that as a part of life. But the fact that it is 'part of life' doesn't mean that it cannot be improved.\n3. Almost one quarter of Toronto's land area is covered by streets - with about 5600 km of roadways.  As of Dec 2022 we only had 270km of on street cycling with an additional 388km of cycling infrastructure in parks and other green spaces.  City of Toronto planned to add another 100 between 2022 and 2024 so lets make it 700km of cycling spaces (many of them are shared spaces...) 700/5600 is 1.25%.  The province wants to tell its citizens that taking up 1.25% of street space (which is a highest end estimate) for cycling is the root of all traffic.  It is laughable and only makes sense if we have too much of #1 and #2 above.\n"

I understand the value of bikes and bike lanes in the context of getting around Toronto, making our streets safer, and more accessible and ecologically responsible.  Please do not allow the removal of any bike lanes in this City.\nPeople will continue to ride bikes along City streets.

        "comment": "I am a citizen who has relied on all forms of local transportation including car, taxi, bus, subway, streetcar, bicycle, and foot. I have found that when facilitated by the city, getting around by bicycle has been the superior mode of transportation from time, personal, financial, and environmental standpoints.\nI am writing in opposition to Bill 212 and wish to focus on four points: (1) efficacy of the proposed measure, (2) safety, (3) environment, and (4) long-term planning.\n1. Efficacy of proposed measure\nThe Ontario government's proposal to remove bike lanes will not ease gridlock in a meaningful way.\n- Traffic choke points exist outside of the bike lanes on Yonge, Bloor, and University. Those choke points will not change. Assuming that the number of cars on the road does not change with the removal of bike lanes, at most what will happen on Yonge, Bloor, and University is that cars will get to sit in traffic a few blocks further up than where they were before. But they will continue to sit in traffic.\n- Many bike lanes share the lane with dedicated narrower parking spaces. In order to genuinely regain a lane of traffic, parking will need to be forbidden on those streets. If parking is not forbidden, cars will not gain a lane and traffic will not noticeably change. The only difference is that cyclists who choose to continue to use that route will be less safe.\nFurther to this point, by the province's logic, removal of street parking would be far more efficient in reducing congestion than the removal of the more space-efficient bike lanes. Street parking is limited and serves a small number of people at a time, but takes up an entire lane, whereas cyclists can share. The province's unwillingness to take this kind of measure to reduce gridlock, instead scapegoating bicycle lanes, is illogical and suggests that the province's goal is to pander to cars rather than to make decisions based on research and logic. If the province's goal is to reduce gridlock, removing street parking would be more effective. If the province's goal is to better serve businesses, then keeping both bike lanes and some street parking is most effective, as research has shown that bike lanes increase business. If the province's goal is to make drivers think they are getting a solution to gridlock without any inconvenience to them, then Bill 212 is the way to go.\n- There appears to be an underlying assumption that getting rid of bike lanes will stop cyclists from using those roads and that cyclists will instead move to side streets or other cycling routes. The fact remains that some of these routes, such as Yonge Street, do not have efficient alternatives for cyclists. The reality is that cyclists will have to choose between adding kilometers to their commute to use side roads or to continue commuting on main roads. Cyclists who do the latter have the right to cycle safely and must be passed by cars with at least a 1 meter margin. This will limit full use of the lane for cars at the cost of cyclist safety. If enough cyclists do this, cars will have gained nothing. Without a true viable alternative for cyclists, all the province is saying to cyclists is \"we don't want you.\"\n- Some cyclists, due to safety issues and longer commute routes, will return to driving, increasing the number of cars on the road and increasing congestion. Traffic will not increase, mobility will decrease, and we will fail that much more to meet our environmental obligations.\nIn sum, there is no evidence that removing bike lanes on these major roads will actually have a positive impact on traffic. Existing traffic choke points will continue to limit the flow of cars on and off of major roads, more people may return to driving thereby increasing congestion, bicycles may continue to use the roads due to a lack of good alternatives, and the province does not seem inclined to stop cars from parking on streets, which is a bigger detriment to traffic than cyclists.\nI also question the practical efficiency and financial efficiency of creating provincial oversight for what is a municipal matter. Municipal governments exist for a reason - presumably because they know what their cities need best. The province has bigger matters to attend to than the arrangement of Toronto's streets.\n2. Safety\nAs touched on above, because cyclists do not always have good alternatives to biking on Yonge, Bloor, and University (and may need to do so for stretches of their commute, regardless), cycling on those roads will not be eliminated. The clear result of removing designated bike lanes is that we will have more cyclist injuries and deaths than we already do. The only way to prevent an increase in cyclist injuries and death would be for less people to bicycle. Again, the message the province is sending to cyclists is \"we don't want you.\"\nThis reality highlights that this bill was designed to pander to drivers without regards to the safety of cyclists or our community's environmental priorities.\n3. Environment\nOur planet is undergoing an undeniable climate crisis. This year alone, we have seen disasters like Hurricane Milton (which rapidly and violently intensified as a result of climate change) and a year's worth of rain in one day in Valencia. We cannot continue to ignore or push off the measures that we need to take for the sake of our planet and future generations.\nIn order to have any chance of making progress towards our environmental goals, some reasonable sacrifices need to be made. Reasonable sacrifices, in this case, would include reducing the number of people driving private vehicles on city streets. We cannot afford to keep making climate priorities come second to the interests of cars.\nI recognize that cars have an important place in our society, including transporting persons with disabilities, transporting large quantities of goods, and making deliveries. However, cars are a major source of pollution and not everyone who is driving a car needs to be doing so. A better solution to improving gridlock than getting rid of bike lanes (which would not be very efficacious, per section #1 above), while helping meet our environmental goals, would be to invest in more public transit and ride shares, and to make car-alternatives such as cycling more attractive.\nFrom a personal standpoint, I cycle to work whenever I can, rain or shine. With proper support for cycling infrastructure, snow and ice would only occasionally impede my ability to cycle in the winter. Cycling gives me some much-needed exercise and helps keep my cost of living lower. It also helps reduce my carbon footprint, and makes me one less driver sitting on the road. If we make cycling a safe and attractive way to get around, we win as a society in far more ways than just delaying the worsening of gridlock.\n4. Long-term planning\nRemoving bicycle lanes from major streets is, at best, a stall tactic for gridlock. It is NOT a solution. The city of Toronto is always growing. Unless we introduce more viable car-alternatives, this growth will only mean more cars, and consequently more gridlock. Removing all the bike lanes in the city will not change that. We need to be realistic. We need to plan for the long-term, not the short-term.\nWe need more than sound bites that distract from real problems. We need real solutions.\n"

In some other cases bike lanes even ease traffic times. It therefore seems to me that, based on the best available data, this Bill is not necessary and will not \"save you time\" as advertised. I feel that the province should reject Bill 212 and focus on more pressing matters like investing in long delayed LRT construction.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing on behalf of Pollination Guelph to express our opposition to the proposed addendum to the framework requiring the removal of sections of bike lanes in Toronto and the institution of a review process for existing bike lanes. This legislation not only undermines sustainable urban planning but also exacerbates climate-related impacts. Climate change is one of the main threats leading to the decline of pollinators, and biodiversity globally.\nTransportation is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, which accelerate climate change. The proposed removal of bike lanes to prioritize motor vehicle traffic would increase emissions by encouraging car dependency. Rising temperatures and shifting weather patterns associated with climate change are already adversely affecting pollinator populations, such as bees and butterflies, which are essential for pollination and maintaining biodiversity.\nBike lanes support climate resilience by reducing emissions, promoting greener transportation, and contributing to urban greening initiatives that benefit pollinators. By encouraging active transportation, bike lanes also help decrease air pollution, which is linked to reduced cognitive function in pollinators. Removing these lanes jeopardizes efforts to mitigate such risks.\nFurthermore, the decision-making process outlined in the bill raises concerns. While the proposed criteria include environmental considerations, prioritizing motor vehicle traffic inherently conflicts with sustainable climate action goals. This approach is at odds with Ontario\u2019s commitment to biodiversity conservation and climate adaptation, especially in urban environments where pollinators already face significant pressures.\nWe urge the government to reconsider this proposal and instead strengthen bike lane infrastructure, which aligns with both climate action and pollinator conservation goals. Protecting and expanding bike lanes supports healthier ecosystems, resilient urban planning, and the well-being of all Ontarians.\n"

        "comment": "This government has prevented the recommended modifications to the OMB, essentially removing any reasonable chance for the city to control developers and leaving them to do what they want.  Further, in alignment with the province's own guidelines, and since it reduces cost/increases profit, developers are increasingly replacing parking spaces with bicycle spaces in new construction.  This will result in many thousand more bicycles on the road, and with biking infrastructure now not only being prevented but being removed, it will mean more injuries and fatalities.\nDuring and after COVID epidemic, the gig economy greatly increased the number of bicycles and 2-wheeled motorized vehicles onto the roads to deliver food and groceries.  Again, this increase in bike lane users combined with a suspension and reduction in bike lanes will result in increased injuries and fatalities, and delivery services will move back to depending on cars.\nFord himself, when on a bike in the Season 1 Episode 2 of \"Political Blind Date\", expressed something along the lines that he would feel unsafe on a bike if he wasn't in a bike lane.  I saw that clip recently but am now unable to find it online.\nAs any drive through the city will show, the large majority of bottlenecks in traffic are due to construction projects, not bike lanes.  Some of these, like water and sewer line replacement, are unavoidable.  Others, especially blockages due to building construction projejcts, are avoidable.  Rules on construction have been relaxed since I first moved here.  Then, building construction projects were rarely allowed to block traffic lanes.  However, for many years, that rule has been relaxed and developers have been able to block roads for years at a time.  Instead of being forced to include reasonable setbacks for logistics and keep the roadway open, they now build as close to the roadway as possible.  In some cases, they use blocked traffic lanes as staging areas.  This is the largest source of preventable gridlock in our city.\nBIAs have stated that the bike lanes are good for business, so removing them will damage our economy.\nToronto's program for bike sharing has been wildly successful, which actually helps in reducing the number of cars that would otherwise be on the road.  Imagine if even half the bikes on the road were replaced by a cars:  more gridlock, longer waits at traffic lights, and more contention for the limited amount of parking around the city.\nFinally, as a Toronto resident and taxpayer, I feel that the city should first serve the people that live here and pay to maintain it.  Facilitating drivers who largely do NOT live here but want to use cars instead of transit, bikes, or walking is something that needs a much lower priority that providing a safe living space for those that do live here and pay for the privilege.\n"

        "comment": "In rapidly growing urban centers like Toronto, bike lanes are not merely a convenience but an essential component of sustainable city infrastructure, much like sidewalks. Their removal undermines safety, reduces viable transportation alternatives, and works against the needs of a dynamic and expanding population. Without bike lanes, cyclists are forced to share lanes with cars, increasing the risk of accidents that disproportionately harm vulnerable road users. Cycling infrastructure on key corridors like Bloor Street, University Avenue, and Yonge Street are essential for creating a connected and functional network, which is vital for both safety and accessibility.\nRemoving bike lanes to alleviate car congestion is a short-sighted approach that ignores the broader need for sustainable transportation options. As Toronto grows, its roadways become increasingly overburdened, and car-centric planning will only exacerbate congestion. Many new developments lack parking facilities, emphasizing the necessity of reliable alternatives to driving.\nBike lanes provide more than safety; they encourage sustainable, efficient, and healthy travel. Cycling is environmentally friendly, offers physical exercise, and is often the fastest way to navigate a congested city. Bike lanes greatly enhance real and perceived safety for cyclists, encouraging broader adoption of this mode of travel, and are an excellent way of integrating with public transit to enable multi-modal trips. To ensure Toronto meets the needs of its growing population, the Ontario government should empower municipalities to expand and prioritize cycling infrastructure. Removing existing bike lanes and creating a more restrictive process for establishing new cycling infrastructure would be a regressive step in building a dynamic and inclusive city. As a result of the above-mentioned items, I thoroughly oppose Bill 212.\n"

Knowing the number of people riding bikes murdered this year alone shows the governments approval of outright murder by removing any bike lanes.  Using the notwithstanding clause on everything people don't agree with the government does is not the way governments are suppose to work.
