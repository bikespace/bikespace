        "comment": "There are not enough people utilizing bike lanes in comparison to motor vehicles. The issue concerning motor vehicle traffic flow is still prevalent and should be solved before introducing more factors.\nIn my experience with bike lanes, users treat them as an express way, with little attention to signage and their surroundings. Or they do not use them at all due to this attention span. This is isn\u2019t policed and continues to be an issue.\nIn my opinion as a resident of Hamilton/Dundas, make these cities more WALKABLE. With outdoor patios, third spaces, pedestrian only walk ways. In a more walkable city, there will be a larger sense of community, more support of businesses big or small, promotes healthy living and car parking would be a non issue.\n"

        "comment": "This regressive mindset that is entirely based off on feelings and contradicted by actual evidence, both recently here, and all over the world, has got to go. We don't need to expand car infrastructure. We NEED to build up other alternative to driving to the quality that would allow them to genuinely be viable options. Adding more drivers to the road because it's the ONLY viable option is not a solution. Expanding our options and making them attractive is. I'm so exhausted of hearing about regressive proposals about removal of bike infrastructure, limiting transit projects, more car infrastructure proposals. It's the 21st century. We have all the information, we have all the data, we have other societies who have vastly outpaced us because we have government officials who are ignorant, wilfully or otherwise, to the realities of every day life and choose to push non sense proposals that sound like it'd be a good idea, if you don't take a fraction of a second and to pause and think about it.\nAbsolutely ridiculous. Even worse, with one of the most openly corrupt provincial governments in power that I've lived through in my lifetime. Allowing them power over my municipal representatives and what currently impacts my everyday life, when they are this blatantly corrupt and disconnected from the lived realities of every day people is an absurdity I have trouble expressing through words.\n"

It will not reduce gridlock, it will not reduce commute times, it will increase pedestrian and cyclist injuries and deaths, and it will increase emissions and pollution. In addition, it is anti-democratic.\nThere is absolutely no research or science backing this legislation\u2019s supposed goals up. We know what more cars do to our cities. Even if the stated goal of moving cars faster is achieved, it will be at the expense of people\u2019s lives. Absolutely shameful.\n"

        "comment": "As both a driver and a cyclist residing in the downtown core and frequent the outskirts of the GTA I OBJECT to this proposed plan.\nKeeping cyclists and drivers physically separated is the safest way to move through a dense city that is only getting denser.\nThe strategy to open up more lanes of traffic to improve traffic flow is short sighted and not based on data. Consider how much demand for roads there ACTUALLY is and realize that solving gridlock is not a question of a few more lanes or a tunnel.\nThe solution lies in alternatives to vehicles. More investment in public transit and less on destroying bike lanes (which by the way will increase traffic through the process of roadwork).\nDoug Ford...you did well with the pandemic...but you are building a laundry list of reasons to get voted out since. Listen to Ontarians and stop these silly plans that nobody asked for!\n"

It seems extremely short-sighted (un-sighted?) to remove them. Literally all studies indicate it\u2019s better for mobility, traffic flow, personal health, cyclist safety, public health, and urban planners consistently align on bike lanes being preferred. KEEP THE LANES. Thunder Bay needs a premier too.\n"

It is simply childish. Shame on us for allowing ourselves to be governed by children. Digging tunnels and tearing out existing bike infrastructure. Shame for wasting the legislatures time with such trivial matters; especially when our province is facing a housing crisis the Government has done little but offer \"stealing the Greenbelt\" as a panacea.

        "comment": "From an environmental standpoint, it is obvious that an increased number of bike lanes has enormous benefits for cleaner air. Bikes are emissions free and, per passenger, require much less material and energy to construct than cars (1,2). Bike infrastructure has a net health-cost benefit (3) as well as local economic benefits (4) and is less costly to maintain per passenger.\nNot only is bike traffic cleaner passenger-by-passenger, but reducing bike infrastructure to increase car infrastructure has an amplifying effect on car traffic due to the effect of \"induced demand\" (5). Therefore, removing or terminating planned bike lanes will have locally amplified car traffic and therefore a strongly negative environmental impact. Conversely, building more bike lanes will shift towards more bike usage and therefore reduced car use and net environmental benefit.\nRegarding \"induced demand\": building more roads or allowing more car traffic in general will not result in relieved congestion, since it will simply lead to more and more traffic (6).\nOverall, this proposal brings severe environmental drawbacks. Furthermore, the proposal does not consider benefits of bike infrastructure to economy and overall transportation efficiency.\nResources:\n(1) https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cities.2021.103475\n(2) https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.03.101\n(3) https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.02464\u2026\n(4) https://doi.org/10.1080/01944363.2019.1638816\n(5) https://www.cbc.ca/news/science/bike-lanes-impacts-1.7358319\n(6) https://www.vtpi.org/gentraf.pdf\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 is a ridiculous bill by our provincial government that plays into current culture wars by attacking bike lanes and cyclists. all studies show that bike lanes reduce minor and critical injuries for cyclists and pedestrians, do not cause more traffic, and help to increase business along roads they are installed on (a study showed that the number of transactions on debit machines along bloor street increased after bike lanes were installed). as a cyclist in toronto, protected bike lanes are crucial to how i travel in the city, especially on major roads. they are far safer than cycling in a busy lane of traffic or on side streets, and so much more pleasant as well. in a time when cyclist deaths are on the rise in toronto, it is a slap in the face by the government to literally ignore the studies behind cycling infrastructure, and make up their own facts, which makes it clear the only people they care about are car driving suburbanites (ie their voter base). Also, this bill makes no sense as bike lanes are a municipal responsibility, not provincial, so it would be encroaching on municipalities rights to provide what their citizens wants in favour of what the provincial government wants to satisfy their base and get elected again. we see other cities like montreal, new york, and paris greatly increase their cycling infrastructure, which has been met by praise by their citizens, as in the future micro mobility in cities becomes more important, as it gives people more options beyond using crumbling public transit infrastructure or just driving (which is of course a horrible for the environment, not that our government cares about that). So it would be a complete backwards step for this bill to be passed, which seems to be what our incompetent provincial government wants.\n"

        "comment": "As a Toronto resident, the existing bike lanes are essential to me, and I want to see them kept indefinitely -- and even expanded.\nFor example, my partner and I use the Bloor lane almost every day. Bloor is an essential pathway for cyclists. With protected lanes, it's the best East-West road to use -- and trust me, during commuting hours, it gets TONS of use. These are all people who could choose to be sitting in cars, clogging up the street, but instead choose to bike because there is a safe path to do so.\nRemoving lanes would only increase traffic by commencing yet another season of construction. Ultimately, it may also reduce biking accessibility and safety, forcing people to get back in cars and add to the traffic, slowing things down even further.\nBike accessibility matters across so many dimensions. More people on bikes enables:\n- a better climate\n- healthier more active communities\n- more engagement with local businesses and more vibrant streets that people enjoy walking and engaging on.\nBikes are an essential part of Toronto's future and the city I want to live in.\nPlease help us build a healthy city, and keep the bike lanes.\n"

Cyclist deaths have been rising and traffic would just slow down on these roads if cyclists have to bike with other traffic. If you\u2019re a driver what\u2019s more annoying than being stuck behind a cyclist since they need to use the road? Separate bike lanes is COMMON SENSE.\n"

The current government should be focused on completing the many ongoing project that are long overdue that might actually ease traffic congestion, and look at other ways to actually move people around the city because adding one more lane back on a handful of streets isn't going to change the amount of cars that are only going to be keep increasing.\n"

        "comment": "My family, friends and I wholeheartedly believe removing and reducing current and future bike lanes is a grave mistake.\nDriving vehicles for some is a luxury, and even those that have driven for years are recently finding it unaffordable for the cost of a vehicle, insurance, fuel/electricity, maintenance.   Many more people within cities and communities are turning to riding bikes to school, work and for errands.\nIt's also a dire safety issue with the province having  NO PLAN to put into place for safe travel, if removing designated bike lanes.  Drivers are more distracted than ever with accidents not only resulting in almost weekly death or serious injury of cyclists.   So protected bike lanes are what the province really should be investing in.\nThere are far too many vehicles on our roads as it is, and commuting from over an hour away is the norm considering affordability of housing these days as well.\nThere are stats to prove all these points.  and with that said, with so many factors to not continue to consider deterring having more protected and dedicated bike lanes.\n"
