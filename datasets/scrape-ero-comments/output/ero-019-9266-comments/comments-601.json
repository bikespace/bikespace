I dream of a Toronto where there are more cycling paths, not less. Removing them won't solve traffic, there are thousands of studies about it, it will be the opposite: those of us that usually cycle will be forced to take a car and that will add more cars on the road.\n"

        "comment": "I am gravely concerned about provincial overreach into municipal affairs-most particularly when policy is more partisan than fact based.\nOver the past few decades more and more expenses have been downloaded from Queens Park to Ontario municipalities (likewise Federal downloading to Provinces). The Province can not now increase its jurisdiction over affairs best managed by municipal councils.\nThe present policy concerning the removal of existing bike lanes and the restriction of new ones is blatantly political and not supported by evidence. This goes hand in hand with the ill conceived plan to plow up high production farmland in Ontario\u2019s breadbasket for another highway that has been shown will have a  negligible effect on commuter times.\nProvincial overreach must be limited.\nAddressing vehicle congestion on municipal roads must be done in a well researched manner.\nMr Ford is applying the thinking of Robert Moses whose policies have for decades been discredited. Let\u2019s not repeat bad history.\n"

        "comment": "This is a distraction from the real transport issues that Ontario suffers from. We need existing bike lanes and fast, reliable and affordable public transport to reduce the need to drive in the GTA. Building new highway(s) is not going to reduce gridlock in the city. The current Government of Ontario has been an absolute disgrace in terms of catering to its Construction lobbyist groups. The government has not clearly disclosed whether or not the new proposed highways will be tolled or not and we do not need more tolled highways as that will once again not reduce gridlock. The Government should be investing in expanding public transport and an Ontario wide rail system instead.\n"

There have been a 40% increase in bike lanes traffic from August 2023 to May 2024. (TCBC, 2024 May)\nIt\u2019s only logical that if you have effective, working infrastructure, you will ultimately get more users and traffic. More bike lanes, more bikers; more car lanes, more cars. How will having more cars yield to reduced gridlock? It does not make any logical sense.\n"

        "comment": "Doug Ford has been pushing the concept of removing red tape and has also multiple time criticized the federal government about interfering with certain areas of provincial decision making. However, this Bill is introducing red tape and removing the ability for municipalities to make appropriate decisions for the well-being of their citizens and their municipalities. There is no valid justification for the province to be involving itself in these areas, nor for adding more difficulties and concerns around municipalities and cities that are attempting to improve or begin green transportation initiatives.\nThe city of Toronto took considerable time, money and effort to determine where their bike lanes should be placed and how to make the roads safer for everyone involved. This is not an area for the provincial government to provide their input, let alone remove all of the hard work that the city has done and essentially prohibit the city of Toronto, as well as other cities and municipalities, from deciding their own way forward based on what their city requires. The provincial government is completely overstepping their jurisdiction and is also interfering with proven methods of reducing pollution in the cities and for allowing any cyclists in the city to be safer when travelling.\nAs well, the justification that is being put forward on why these bike lanes should be removed are based on flawed and improper data. These lanes are making cyclists feel safer, have increased business revenue for business along these routes, and have had minimal, if any, impact on how long it takes a car driver to travel along these roads.\nWhen transportation options are being considered, cars should not be given more power over other options: cars take up considerable space for very few passengers, do extensive environmental damage, and take a big toll on the roads than other forms of transportation (when considered on a per person basis). Bike lanes provide an environmentally sound method of transportation and allow people to more safely be able to commute across the streets of the city.\nAs per the City of Toronto's data (https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/8f76-2019-Cycling-Pub\u2026), the number of people cycling has continued to increase year-over-year and roughly 70% of people currently cycle in the city: \"The percentage\nof reported cyclists in the City of Toronto continues to increase over the past 20 years, with seven\nin ten Toronto residents (70%) who reported cycling compare to 54 per cent in 2009 and 48 per\ncent in 1999. While the percentage of Toronto residents that reported being recreational cyclist\n(meaning the cycle for recreation or fitness) has remained steady (26% in 2019, 25% in 2009 and\n28% in 1999) Toronto residents who reported being utilitarian cyclists (meaning they either cycle\nto work, school, to go shopping or visit friends) has increase from 29 per cent in 2009 to 44 per\ncent in 2019.\"  (https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/8f76-2019-Cycling-Pub\u2026)\nAdditionally, the bike lanes make these cyclists feel safer, and they would like to have more bike lanes on major streets, not less. \"Asked about their comfort levels on certain types of streets/paths, Toronto residents are twice as likely to say they feel comfortable or somewhat comfortable with major roads with bike lanes/cycle tracks (31% comfortable, 32% somewhat comfortable) than without bike lanes/cycle track (15% comfortable, 20% somewhat comfortable). A majority report feeling comfortable or somewhat comfortable on residential streets (41% comfortable, 36% somewhat comfortable) and on bike trails and multi-use paths (58% comfortable, 25% somewhat comfortable). Those classified as interested but concerned/bike curious were nearly four times more likely to report being comfortable with major roads with bike lanes/cycle tracks (22% comfortable, 33% somewhat comfortable) than major roads without bike lanes (four per cent comfortable, 10% somewhat comfortable).\"\nThe cost of removing these bike lanes is staggeringly high, with the latest estimate being $48 million; this is a significant amount and could be spent in much better ways by the province.\nOther municipalities are now holding off on implementing their own cycling infrastructure plans as they do not want to waste tax-payer money and are unsure of what the future will bring.\nOntario should be working with municipalities and not against them. The municipalities should be making these decisions on their own and the only influence that the province should have is on potentially subsidizing some of these healthy, green initiatives; instead, the province is being heavy-handed and refusing to allow the municipalities to have the proper authority that they have been given on managing their roads and infrastructure.\nWe are supposed to be working at reducing pollution and improving green options, yet this Bill does the opposite: it will not allow there to be safe, effective and efficient bike lanes to commute from work to home and to get around the city in a safe and efficient manner. Instead, this Bill is allowing the drivers to continue to pollute and to use up as much road space as they want, while all others are left with fewer options and methods of traversing their own home towns in a safe and efficient manner.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 is so wrong-headed. It flies against fact-based evidence. Instead of showing leadership by recognizing the value of bike lanes and providing municipalities with adequate funding to address the complications of integrating cars and bikes into effective, civil solutions, the current government is taking a sledgehammer to decades of progressive planning for selfish, political ends.  Its ill-conceived plans for bike lanes are once again a blatant overreach with no public consultation, no research, no valid case for the brutal action Bill 212 promises to impose on municipalities.\nPandering to those mired in the past,  with no knowledge of or interest in addressing the real crisis dooms everyone. Climate change, which enveloped Toronto in thick smog, stifling heat and hot air last summer, will only get worse the more cars you put on more highways. Short-sighted, self-interested  policies will ensure an ignominious legacy for this government in the future. Reversing these policies would be seen as courageous. I urge you to do so, beginning with scrapping the Bill 212 provision concerning bike lanes. The Committee has the power to show leadership where a gaping vacuum exists. Think of the daunting future we all face and do the right thing.\n"

There was no question that it was a test of nerves as the city had zero accomodations for the safety of riders.  For me though, very strapped for cash, biking was a necessity.\nFifty years later, I still often find it the most efficient and reliable way to get around town. I also often drive and also take transit. Bike lanes have made cycling so much safer, even though cyclists still need to be on alert. Our Transit system is already not adequate for the number of users and with the much needed housing being built, it's about to get much busier.\nI worry for young riders, like my grandson who is just starting to ride as a means of transportation. He has been riding since he was a toddler on a family bike but now he's ready to go on his own. I fear for him and others that they will battle the traffic as I did, 50 years ago.\n"

        "comment": "As a Torontonian who's used bike lanes on a daily basis - particularly on Bloor - I am horrified that you are proposing the removal of existing lanes and the stopping of future lanes. You do not understand how aggressive drivers in Toronto are - considering many don't even live here and are just commuting, they have an outsized, negative impact on my day-to-day life unlike anything I've experienced in the many Canadian and American cities I\u2019ve lived in or visited. The ONLY thing that keeps me safer are the new, separated lanes. I have seen drivers break every possible rule (going through red lights, using left-turn or opposite-direction lanes to pass traffic, go backwards on undivided bike lanes to go against one-way traffic) and you are rewarding them with further rights as you strip away mine. We, the vulnerable road users that emit no pollution and reduce the gridlock of traffic by commuting without cars, are being put in harm's way. How are you serving your citizens by doing this? There will still be gridlock - 401 is one of the widest highways in the world and it's always jammed. Please study INDUCED DEMAND to understand why increasing lanes won't help drivers. Furthermore, this bill is fiscally irresponsible - you are encouraging more cars into densely-populated areas which will jack up healthcare costs for Ontario. I can't walk/bike outside during rush hour because the air is heavy with exhaust - it feels like any gains made through exercising are more than lost through breathing in polluted air. Please get on the right side of history and do right by your people - you do realize you will increase deaths for both vulnerable road users and the additional drivers you're encouraging to gridlock our downtown streets, right? Surely this is not worth getting a few extra votes. Please help me to believe you serve all of your citizens, because this bill makes me feel like you don\u2019t care about the 80%+ of us who live in a census metropolitan area. One additional note: I am so disappointed that you include broadband connectivity in this bill. I am all for giving rural communities access to the internet, which is the opposite action of stripping the health and safety rights of people who live in cities (again, 80%+ of Ontarians).\n"

It will slow them down, because now they'll be behind a bike.\nWe just paid for some of these to go in, too.\nWe need to EXPAND bike lanes, subways, high speed rail, and bus routes.\nGet more cars OFF the road, to reduce the load on the road; bikes and buses can fit hundreds more people that we have no room for if everyone's in their own car.\nThis money can go towards funding that.\nOr you know, paying for new hospitals and actually paying nurses what the deserve so you don't need to pay exorbitant amounts for emergency contract nurses.\nDidn't you guys campaign on ending hallway medicine? The hospitals here are still full of stretchers of people who can't get a hospital room because you're not funding the nurses and doctors needed.\nDo something helpful for the majority of Ontarians, instead of your buddies who are already rich.\nYou're supposed to be leaders people look up to.\n"
