        "comment": "Please find below my comments and concerns with regards to this bill:\n1) Safety concern - The proposal to remove the bike lanes on Bloor St., Yonge St., and University Ave would result in putting more cyclists in danger as they commute to and from work each day. Personally, I use the bike lane on Yonge St and my husband uses the bike lanes on all three streets, and the only reason I am able to bike to work on such a busy street is because a bike lane was installed. I see many cyclists use the bike lane on Yonge St everyday, and removing the bike lane would put many cyclists lives in danger. I do not want to be a dead body on Yonge St because I was driving on a shared lane with a car. I do not want to one day find out that my husband has been hospitalized because of a car accident on Bloor St.\n2) Environmental concern - As we deal with worsening climate change issues, the province should be focusing on promoting more environmentally-friendly methods of transportation instead of proposing to remove what Toronto has already put in place to encourage alternative methods of transportation. Removing bike lanes on Bloor St., Yonge St., and University Ave would probably push some people to drive as they would no longer feel safe commuting with their bikes. This is not the direction that we, as a province, should be moving toward.\n3) Efficiency concern - I am wary of the inefficiencies that would arise should municipalities be required to seek provincial approval for the implementation of new bike lanes. This step will significantly delay the approval of implementing new bike lanes. I am worried about the inefficient use of taxpayer dollars as proposals get stuck in the bureaucratic back and forth between municipalities and the province because municipalities lost the power to implement new bike lanes on their own.\nI urge the province to consider my three points and reconsider the proposals in this bill. The focus on more car lanes is narrow-minded, shortsighted, and frankly, downright irresponsible.\n"

        "comment": "I am very disaapointed to hear about the items in this bill.\nFirstly the 413 is not necessary and will further accelerate more suburban style housing which this region cannot build anymore of. 70 years of suburban and highway development has basically put us in this mess of having some of the worst traffic in North America. Do we want to continue building with the same strategies that will further increase car use and overflow local roads and connecting highways. This is a mistake.\nIn regards to bike lanes, we know that once they are removed, traffic or congestion in the area won't really improve much at all. If you have been in the area prior to the bike lane installation, cars were always parking in the right lane even when they weren't allowed too because well, there are people that feel like they are above everyone else and that their needs are more important. Not only that, there are subway lines under the lanes that the Ford Gov't wants to remove. There is definitely people capacity along these routes, no one needs to drive along them. Indeed, we have had 6 people die in this city while riding their bikes. No one should have to die or be injured anywhere just because they choose to use their preferred method of transportation. When has the safety been trumped by people who want to use one of the less efficient modes of transportation in the city?\nI know that what I have wrote won't matter as the decision has already been made not by facts or reasoning, but ideology. This is all just a waste money and time which is better spent on more important things in this province.\n"

        "comment": "Over the past 30 years, I have witnessed Montreal\u2019s remarkable transformation from having no bike lanes to an extensive network of them. As bike lanes have proliferated, car traffic has noticeably decreased. It\u2019s incredible to see so many people using bikes not just for fitness but as a primary mode of transportation. As biking has surged, car congestion in Montreal has significantly declined. The demand for bike rentals has grown so much that the city has had to expand its rental network to keep up.\nWhat\u2019s particularly noteworthy is that despite Montreal\u2019s colder winters and heavier snowfall compared to Toronto, winter biking remains robust, with traffic levels at about 80% of summer usage.\nToronto\u2019s bike lane network is still in its infancy, and current underutilization should not be seen as a reason to halt progress. Montreal\u2019s experience shows that as bike infrastructure improves and biking becomes easier, usage grows, car congestion decreases, and commute times improve for everyone.\nI urge the provincial government to adopt a long-term vision rather than the short-sighted approach that will do little to address Toronto\u2019s severe traffic congestion. Investing in an expanded bike network will not only ease traffic but also boost our economy by enabling smarter commuting options and freeing up roads for those who cannot bike.\nLet\u2019s ensure Toronto develops a world-class bike network that benefits all.\n"

        "comment": "I am against removing the existing bike lanes. More people biking means less people in cars. If you take out the lanes, you either force cyclists into regular traffic (slower behind a cyclist, or more accidents that can seriously harm/kill cyclists), or make them get into a car instead. Removing the bike lanes will cost millions of dollars and waste more time by putting these roads back \u201cunder construction.\u201d Bike lanes make it safer for everyone and reduce traffic. The government should spend more money on public transit and more bike lanes to reduce the number of people driving. That is how you reduce traffic.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly disagree with both the removal of bike lanes and the building of highway 413 without environmental consultation.\nRemoving bike lanes will not improve traffic flow, and will only make cycling more dangerous. This is evident in decades of study in other cities in Europe, Canada and the United States. Bike lanes on side streets is not viable as Toronto is not a grid. I live around Dundas and McCaul and commute to Parkdale for work by bike, and I am unsure which side streets I am supposed to be using that run between Queen and Dundas. Additionally, from experience, sticking to side streets often requires one to make dangerous turns into busy streets downtown- when I visit my parent's home in the Junction area, sticking to back streets requires dangerous left and right turns into North-South streets with unmarked intersections. It is obvious that those suggesting this are not cyclists or urbanists, and merely dislike the appearance of bicycles on main streets. While cyclists are not the majority, I do not think our minority status should make us second-class road users, or our safety a low priority.\nCycling is the mode of transportation that makes the most sense in the downtown core for travelling short distances, and around 70% of Torontonians describe themselves as cyclists in some capacity. I have delighted in the past few years watching the number of cyclists on the road grow, and seeing the safety of the bike lane system allowing families with children to ride together, more elderly people on bikes, and seeing people with disabilities safely able to use recumbent bikes.\nAdditionally, I do not see the value in building highway 413 in our wetland areas without thorough environmental consultation. This appears to be a highway to nowhere that will cost more money and be more environmentally destructive than simply buying back the 407.\nAs a taxpayer and constituent of the Ontario government, I would prefer if the resources we are proposing to spend on the contents of this bill went towards improving our public transit system. Toronto's population is rapidly growing, and it is unreasonable to believe that the majority of the population should continue to rely on a private, often single-occupancy vehicle to travel in the city. The cause of gridlock is cars. Other large cities realize this and have built world-class public transit systems, and there is no reason we should be so far behind them- the last line of the TTC was built in 2002, when we had 4.9 million people. We now have 10 million. More cars off the road means that emergency services, delivery vehicles, tradespeople, disabled people, and families can get around the city faster.\nThank you for taking time to read this letter.\n"

        "comment": "The removal of these bike lanes will directly impact my safety as a cyclist. I plan my commute based on the existence of these separated bike lanes, as I am safer separated from vehicle traffic. I particularly use the Bloor street bike lanes, and I do not have an alternative east-west route that includes bike lanes.\nI do not understand the logic of destroying relatively brand new infrastructure at a significant cost to taxpayers, with the end result causing the streets to become less safe for vulnerable road users. Cyclists do not have an alternative route, meaning they will still be using these streets, but will be far less safe and far less predictable for drivers trying to share the road.\nPlease do not interfere with decisions that municipalities have made on behalf of their residents, instead please focus on building better transit to create other alternatives to driving.\n"

        "comment": "What an atrocious thing that Premier Ford is attempting to do. Removing bike lanes will do NOTHING to stop congestion. My father rode his bicycle to and from work (north from South Etobicoke, from Lakeshore along Kipling and/or Islington) nearly every day for work before he retired. He has been hit by cars numerous times - including breaking his arm twice. I am confident that if bike lanes existed there, he would have been safer on his commute to and from work and would not have been injured. I myself rode my bicycle to and from Ryerson (as it was called when I was a student there) along the Waterfront Trail and then through the downtown city streets. The trail felt significantly safer than sharing the road with cars, cars filled with drivers that feel entitled to the entirety of the road. Not to mention some who seem to have murderous intent when it comes to cyclists...\nYou know what would actually help? Finally finishing the never ending transit projects (Eglinton, Finch...)  and IMPROVING transit so that more people can take transit to where they need to go. I do not have my licence and depend on the TTC, my own two feet, and my bicycle to get around. The safer this city can be, not only for people like myself, the better. We should divert away from a car-centric approach for this city - more cars = more traffic = more pollution = more problems.\nI'm a lifelong Toronto resident - grew up here, went to university here, got married at City Hall this past June, have never lived anywhere else. It has been heartbreaking to see Premier Ford be so ruthless in his quest to destroy so much of this city (Ontario Place, for example, which my husband and I live near) and this seems to be yet another aspect of the city that he's dipping his greedy fingers into. Moving forward with this will be a tremendous waste of taxpayer money (which Premier Ford seems SO concerned about not wasting...) , money that could be put towards myriad of other things (healthcare, HOUSING, rent control, etc).\nDo what is right for the people of Toronto and leave us and our bike lanes ALONE.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes keep bikers safe. Imagine if we didn't have sidewalks. City residents bike, walk, drive, and take the bus. There is room for everyone to get around safely, and the bike lanes protect people. Those making these decisions don't bike so they don't know the importance first hand. That's not just. Also, I live part time in Montreal and bike lanes don't slow down traffic. What helps traffic flow is more advanced signals for pedestrians, bikers and drivers. And not being able to make a right on a red light. These traffic controls make it so much easier, safer and less stressful to move around the city. Including as a driver! I don't have to worry about hitting a cyclist or pedestrian when I have a dedicated turning light. European cities also have this. I thought when Toronto got bike lanes, we were being more advanced in road infrastructure. Now people want to go backwards and back to chaos. It's extremely shortsighted.\n"

        "comment": "As a concerned resident of Ontario, I oppose the government\u2019s proposed Bill 212 \u2013 the Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024. Specifically, I oppose the provision calling for the removal of bike lanes on key Toronto streets such as Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue. This decision not only undermines the progress we have made in building sustainable, multimodal transportation networks but is also short-sighted from an engineering and urban planning perspective. The following points outline my concerns.\n1. Impact on Road Safety\nRemoving bike lanes in favor of additional motor vehicle lanes is a significant step backward in terms of road safety, both for cyclists and drivers. The addition of bike lanes to major streets was based on decades of research demonstrating that dedicated cycling infrastructure reduces the likelihood of collisions between cyclists and motor vehicles. According to the \u201cOntario Road Safety Annual Report\u201d by the Ministry of Transportation, cycling safety improvements have led to a reduction in injuries in cities with robust bike lane networks. Removing bike lanes will reintroduce the dangerous mix of cyclists and motor vehicles in shared spaces, increasing the likelihood of accidents and potentially escalating insurance claims, which would ultimately cost Ontarians more.\n2. Environmental Concerns\nOne of the central tenets of sustainable urban transportation is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Removing bike lanes would create disincentives for cycling, a mode of transport that produces zero emissions. This is in direct conflict with Ontario\u2019s broader environmental goals outlined in the \u201cClimate Change Action Plan\u201d and the Province's \u201cClimate Change Strategy\u201d, which emphasize increasing cycling and public transit use. Adding lanes for vehicles exacerbates traffic congestion, increases air pollution, and contributes to climate change. The Government should instead be investing in expanding cycling infrastructure, which is in line with Ontario\u2019s commitment to reducing carbon emissions.\n3. Urban Mobility and Traffic Congestion\nThe assertion that removing bike lanes will help ease gridlock is fundamentally flawed. Studies from cities around the world, including those with similar traffic conditions like Copenhagen and Amsterdam, show that cycling infrastructure actually improves overall traffic flow by encouraging more people to cycle, thereby reducing the number of cars on the road. Removing bike lanes in favour of additional vehicle lanes only leads to marginal increases in vehicle throughput, which are often countered by increased congestion in the long term as urban populations grow. Additionally, the engineering principle of \"induced demand\" suggests that expanding roadways simply leads to more traffic, rather than alleviating congestion.\n4. Economic Considerations\nCycling is a cost-effective transportation solution. It reduces the burden on public transit systems, lowers health care costs by promoting active lifestyles, and brings economic benefits to local businesses by increasing foot traffic and reducing parking demand. Studies have shown that areas with bike lanes see increased retail sales because cycling enhances access to shops and restaurants. The removal of bike lanes from prominent areas like Bloor, Yonge, and University Avenue risks reversing these economic benefits and discouraging both cyclists and businesses from supporting a sustainable, active transportation economy.\n6. Misuse of Provincial Taxpayer Money\nThe proposal to use provincial funds to pay for the removal of bike lanes on key Toronto streets raises serious concerns about the misuse of taxpayer money. Over the years, the City of Toronto has invested heavily in developing bike infrastructure, which includes not only the physical construction of bike lanes but also the substantial planning, design, and community consultation efforts. According to reports from the City\u2019s Transportation Services Division, the planning, design, and construction of bike lanes can cost anywhere between $100,000 to $500,000 per kilometer, depending on the complexity of the route and whether it involves physical separation from motor vehicle lanes.\nTo now shift provincial funding towards the removal of these lanes, and to return sections of Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue to motor vehicle lanes, represents a wasteful expenditure of public funds. These tax dollars could instead be allocated to expanding and enhancing the existing cycling infrastructure across Ontario, which aligns with broader transportation and environmental goals. Furthermore, the cost of demolishing or repurposing these bike lanes could vastly exceed the cost of maintaining or expanding them.\n7. Vision Zero and Road Safety\nThe City of Toronto has committed to a Vision Zero mandate, which aims to eliminate traffic fatalities and serious injuries on its streets. This is a highly commendable and necessary policy that aligns with global best practices in traffic safety. Removing bike lanes undermines Vision Zero by compromising the safety of cyclists, pedestrians, and even drivers. The goal of Vision Zero is to create safer, more inclusive roadways where all users, including cyclists, can share the space in harmony.\nThe removal of bike lanes from critical arteries like Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue increases the risk of collisions between cyclists and motor vehicles, directly contravening the Vision Zero principles. Studies have shown that cities with integrated bike lanes experience fewer traffic fatalities, as the separation of cyclists from vehicular traffic decreases the likelihood of accidents. For example, research from Toronto Public Health has shown that cycling infrastructure reduces fatalities by up to 45% on major streets. The engineering rationale here is clear: bike lanes save lives and improve road safety outcomes. Therefore, removing them would not only be a step backward in terms of safety but also a setback in achieving Toronto\u2019s Vision Zero mandate.\n8. Wasteful Rehabilitations and Design Costs\nAnother significant issue with the proposed bill is the financial waste associated with the rehabilitation of roadways that have recently been upgraded to include bike lanes. The implementation of dedicated cycling infrastructure often requires significant investments in both the physical roadwork and the planning and design process. These costs include road resurfacing, lane reconfigurations, and the installation of new traffic infrastructure, such as bike racks, signage, and signals.\nFor example, the recent rehabilitation of Bloor Street, which involved lane reconfigurations to create safer spaces for cyclists, cost the City of Toronto millions of dollars. If the bike lanes are removed, not only will this represent a direct financial loss, but the work done to accommodate these features would have to be undone at additional taxpayer expense.\nIn engineering terms, this constitutes a failure to maintain the principle of infrastructure sustainability. Public funds should be used efficiently to maintain and improve existing assets, not to reverse decisions that were made after careful engineering assessments and community consultation. The proposed removal of these lanes, after years of investment in their design and construction, would be a poor use of taxpayer money, especially considering the long-term cost of having to rehabilitate the roads again for different purposes.\n9. Traffic Signal Timing and Flow Impacts\nThe engineering design of roads, particularly urban streets, is carefully planned to optimize traffic flow, pedestrian safety, and the integration of different modes of transportation. Bike lanes play an important role in this planning, as their presence can influence signal timing and the overall flow of traffic. The removal of bike lanes will likely necessitate changes to existing traffic signal timings and could worsen overall congestion, as more motor vehicle lanes typically lead to longer green phases for cars and less efficient flow for all road users.\nThe integration of bike lanes has allowed for more balanced traffic signal timings that accommodate cyclists, pedestrians, and vehicles. With bike lanes removed, the system would have to be recalibrated to prioritize vehicular traffic, potentially leading to longer wait times for cyclists and pedestrians. The overall efficiency of the transportation network would decrease, as changes to traffic signal systems often lead to unintended delays and bottlenecks. These engineering adjustments also come at an additional cost to taxpayers and often require months or even years of recalibration and fine-tuning.\n10. Environmental and Social Considerations\nIn the broader context of Ontario's environmental policies, the removal of bike lanes contradicts efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the impact of climate change. The more we invest in cycling infrastructure, the more we encourage sustainable transportation options and reduce reliance on carbon-heavy private cars. The financial and environmental benefits of cycling far outweigh the negligible improvements in traffic flow that may arise from removing bike lanes.\nFurthermore, the social benefits of cycling infrastructure cannot be overlooked. Bike lanes encourage healthy lifestyles, reduce noise pollution, and promote a more equitable transportation system by providing a low-cost, accessible alternative to driving for people from all socioeconomic backgrounds. Removing bike lanes reduces the transportation options available to those who rely on cycling as a primary means of getting around, thus disproportionately impacting low-income and marginalized communities.\nSummary\nBill 212, particularly the provision regarding the removal of bike lanes on Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue, is misguided from both an engineering and fiscal perspective. It misallocates provincial tax money by funding the removal of infrastructure that was carefully planned, designed, and implemented at great cost. It undermines the City of Toronto\u2019s Vision Zero mandate and compromises road safety. It also exacerbates the environmental and social challenges that Ontario faces in achieving sustainability and equitable transportation.\nInstead of dismantling these bike lanes, the Ontario government should prioritize investment in expanding and enhancing cycling infrastructure, ensuring it complements other transportation modes, and contributes to a safer, more sustainable, and more efficient urban transportation network. I call on the Ontario Legislature to halt the progression of this bill and reconsider its approach to urban transportation planning by consulting with transportation engineers, urban planners, environmental scientists, and the public to develop a more balanced, sustainable, and forward-thinking approach to transportation policy.\nI urge the Ontario Legislature to reconsider this bill, as it poses significant risks to the safety of Ontarians, the environment, and the long-term sustainability of our urban mobility systems. Instead of removing bike lanes, the Province should be investing in expanding cycling infrastructure as part of a broader strategy to fight gridlock, reduce emissions, and create safer, healthier communities. This approach aligns with engineering best practices for transportation planning and supports Ontario\u2019s environmental and economic goals.\nI call on the members of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario (including the Standing Committee on Transportation) to carefully review the potential consequences of this proposal and engage in a broader consultation with experts in urban planning, transportation engineering, and environmental science before moving forward with any legislation that would negatively impact cycling infrastructure.\n"
