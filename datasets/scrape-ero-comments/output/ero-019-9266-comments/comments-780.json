        "comment": "Years ago we had one lane roads only, and traffic was controlled. As we opened more and more roads people's response was to buy a 2nd or 3rd vehicle, just because it was faster to drive, no matter the financial cost. That has happened many times, humans just consume more and more as we have more alternatives and more \"space\". This will happen with downtown roads, traffic will be worse, bikes will share roads with cars, more accidents, more injuries, more contamination in a already saturated area. The common sense would be that transportations means shouldn't compete each other (TTC, LightRail, Cars, Bikes, etc) but to complement each other, so, doesn't makes sense to have more lanes for cars in a section where you can take the TTC. Think on this: what problem are you solving by removing bike lanes? Is the problem for a few, or the problem of the majority of us that live and work in downtown?. Use common sense and don't spend money on futile projects.\n"

        "comment": "\"The Government of Ontario: Recognizes the need to build priority highways faster as our province grows in order to get people and goods out of gridlock and save drivers and businesses time and money.\"\nOnly half of this statement has some merit to it. Getting people and goods around the province quickly should unquestionably be a priority for the provincial government. This statement of recognition assumes that this must be done by expanding infrastructure for cars, and it is high time we leave this outdated way of thinking in the past. There are simply better (more environmental, efficient, and cheap) ways of getting people and goods around the province than investing primarily in car travel. Cars are more expensive, environmentally impactful and use space inefficiently as opposed to other methods of travel such as cycling, buses, and trains. As an Ontarian, prioritizing funding and resources towards developing any other method of transit aside from cars is what I would like to see.\nThis plan to require the provincial government to approve the additions of new bike lanes in certain circumstances is an overreach of their power. Bike infrastructure is miniscule in size compared to car lanes, and rarely span uninterrupted by car-prioritizing infrastructure across its own municipality, much less into another. Bike lanes are all but unheard of in the wide swaths of rural land that make up most of Ontario. Is there evidence that their existence is truly hindering the speed at which people and goods travel across the province in a way that harms profits? And forget province-wide, is there even evidence that it makes any meaningful impact within the bounds of municipalities themselves? Each bike lane removed will lead to hundreds of people opting for car travel instead, which will surely congest traffic further.\nOn a wider scale, Highway 413 is concerning to me for similar environmental concerns - the sheer amount of land required to build a highway is far more invasive than something like a rail system. With development across the world in recent years surrounding high-speed rail, why remain stuck in the past?\n"

        "comment": "This Act is in direct contrast to proven best practices in the field of urban studies. I have been a volunteer cycling advocate for twenty years and keep up to date on all relevant research. The only way to reduce gridlock is to reduce the number of people driving. Creating safe interconnected networks of bike infrastructure leads to \"modal shift\" - more people can choose cycling over car use for everyday travel purposes such as errands and commuting. Cycling needs to be prioritized as a safe, convenient and enjoyable way to get around communities of all sizes - cities, towns and hamlets. Our community of Haliburton Village is working on an Active Village Pathways Network to encourage this change in behaviour. If a family can get by with one car instead of two, the money they save can be put toward to housing and food - so important in the current affordability crisis. If children grow up being able to safely ride a bike to school, friends and activities - they establish healthy lifestyles, have better mental outlook, are more engaged in their community. There will be savings in healthcare. Municipalities and provincial cycling advocacy organizations serve the people best when they follow evidence-based decision making. This provincial Act is insults the integrity of expertise that has gone into cycle network planning. Reconsider today! Thank you.\n"

I hope that the Bill is passed quickly.\nI am an avid cyclist, but the placement of bike lanes in the City of Toronto, particularly on Bloor Street, was completely devoid of common sense (and the City's consultation process was opaque and did not even pretend to be objective).\nRemoving a lane of traffic from primary roads that were built for heavy use has forced vehicle traffic onto secondary streets.  These secondary streets were built for light traffic and low speeds.  They are now used with a frequency (and at speeds) for which they were not designed.\nIf bike lanes are to be built, they should be built along secondary roads.\n"

        "comment": "I am shocked by this proposed legislation.  This is over-reach by the Provincial government.   Decisions on bicycle lanes are part of municipal planning frameworks.  There is no reason for the Provincial government to be involved or over-ride these decisions.\nOur goal should be to get more people onto bikes not less.  The relative safety provided by separated bike lanes is vital in encouraging more people to cycle to work, school and for recreation.\nGridlock in Toronto and other cities is not caused by bicycle lanes, but by construction and too many cars on the road.  People choosing to use public transit and to cycle, reduces the number of cars on the road.  In Toronto, bicycle lanes on University Avenue and Bloor Street have made a huge difference in the ability to travel more safely around the city, encouraging many people like myself to cycle.  This is what will reduce gridlock - not taking out bicycle lanes.\nAs a resident of Ontario, I would expect my safety as a cyclist to be just as important as that of a car driver.  Within one kilometre of where I live, there are 3 ghost bikes, representing cyclists killed by vehicles.  Toronto has been adding bicycle lanes to try and reduce these fatalities and injuries.  The Provincial government should be supporting safety measures not making the lives of their citizens more dangerous.\n"

This Bill ignores the fact that many people do not own cars and instead use bicycles to commute or run errands. Bike lanes provide safety for cyclists. To remove them would mean that cars, trucks, and cyclists would have to exists in the same lanes of traffic. Why increase the safety risk for the most vulnerable on the roads?\nI strongly oppose this Bill and ask that members of provincial government please consider the perspective of cyclists and the greater good and safety of the communities in question.\n"

        "comment": "This Bill is extremely flawed, blatantly misleading in its supposed desired outcome and actively dangerous to the environment & citizens of this province.\nSchedule 1 & 2 allows for the seizure of personal property with a lack of due process, this violates our charter of rights and freedoms.\nSchedule 3: It is completely irresponsible to exempt highways from the standard procedure of land surveying and environmental assessments from both a fiscal and practical standpoint. In fact these studies are extra critical in the case of highway 413 which is being built through wet land area. Even if you don't care about the impacts on species at risk (which this provincial government clearly doesn't) these surveys are needed to determine the viability of any construction. I have a civil engineering degree and work in the industry. It need to be stated that building a road on soil which will have liquefaction issue, massive settlement will result in extremely high costs for initial construction, have reduced service life and massively increase maintenance costs. Furthermore building in a water shed requires careful planning of the grading and elevation in order to avoid washout and flooding which again will lead to lover service life and could cause dangerous conditions for both drivers and adjacent areas. Skipping this important planning step, will not save time as the issues that are bound to arise from inadequate design planning will cause greatly increased cost and substantial delays in operation when unforeseen issues pop up during construction or afterwards. This government claims\nSchedule 4 & Amendments: This bike lanes have been prove in peer reviewed study after study to improve traffic not impeded it, and boost sales at local businesses not harm them. This can be seen by looking at many European cities, Montreal, but you don't have to look any further than the Bloor bike lane which showed increased sales at local business compared to a control street where bike lanes were not installed. These lanes reduce congestion by allowing more trips (both full and last km before/after transit) be taken by bikes. Every car off the street is one less car blocking up car lanes. The removal of the three most important bike lanes in Toronto would cripple the bike system, harm drivers be a massive waste of money, cause more construction and slow traffic. The province has shown inabillity to properly manage the transit projects it is currently working, yet now it wants to take on the additional responsibility of reviewing each and every minor road variance of every municipality in the entire province?\nSchedule 5: Previous legislation has taken strides to remove predatory tow truck drivers who may as well be con-artists. They impound vehicles then charge astronomical fees and make it extremely difficult and time consuming to retrieve your vehicle charging you all the while. I have the victim of this and while my insurance paid for it as I was not at fault for the collision, this price gouging just results in higher fees and premium for regular citizens.\n"

        "comment": "The Ontario government should not be able to remove or impact bike lanes within the city of Toronto. City planning should be governed municipally and not used as a pawn for provincial politics. If the provincial government wants to discuss traffic, they can look to their own jurisdiction of metrolinx projects causing congestion without the diversionary and divisive tactic of pointing at bike lanes. Bike lanes reduce congestion by providing a life saving alternative form of travel, reducing pressure on car travel. As both a driver (primarily) and a cyclist (rarely) I appreciate bike lanes to formalize how cars and bikes interact on busy city streets and believe they reduce conflict and save lives. The Ford gov should pay attention to fixing Metrolinx and stop strong-arming municipal politics as a diversionary tactic.\n"

        "comment": "I am against this bill. Not only is this exceeding provincial jurisdiction, but we should be expanding bike lanes in Toronto, not reducing them from our most biked roads. I use Bloor and university to bike almost every day. The removal of these bike lanes would be devastating.\nBike lanes are an essential part of urban infrastructure, and eliminating them would have significant negative consequences for Toronto\u2019s residents, economy, and environment. Here\u2019s why they should not only be preserved but expanded:\n1.\tSupport for Active Commuters\nAs a daily cyclist, you represent a growing demographic in Toronto that relies on biking as a primary mode of transportation. Bike lanes ensure a safer and more efficient commute for these residents, reducing conflicts with motor vehicles and pedestrians.\n\t2.\tEnvironmental Benefits\nEncouraging cycling reduces reliance on cars, lowering greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality. Expanding bike lanes aligns with Toronto\u2019s goals to combat climate change and build a more sustainable city.\n\t3.\tHealth and Well-being\nCycling promotes physical health and mental well-being. Accessible bike lanes motivate more people to adopt an active lifestyle, reducing healthcare costs associated with sedentary behavior.\n\t4.\tTraffic Congestion Relief\nWell-planned bike lanes help reduce car traffic, as more people switch to cycling. This creates a more efficient transportation network, benefiting all commuters, including drivers.\n\t5.\tEconomic Advantages\nStudies show that bike-friendly infrastructure boosts local businesses by increasing foot traffic and accessibility. Cyclists are more likely to stop at shops and cafes, contributing to the local economy.\n\t6.\tEquity and Accessibility\nCycling is an affordable mode of transportation that serves individuals from diverse economic backgrounds. Expanding bike lanes ensures equitable access to safe and efficient travel for all residents.\n\t7.\tVision for a World-Class City\nMany global cities, including Amsterdam, Copenhagen, and even New York City, have invested heavily in cycling infrastructure to great success. Toronto has the opportunity to lead in North America by prioritizing a sustainable, multi-modal transportation system.\nEliminating bike lanes would be a step backward, compromising safety, accessibility, and progress toward a greener future. Instead, the city should expand its network of bike lanes to create a healthier, more vibrant, and connected Toronto for all residents.\n"

Bikeway infrastructure provisions serve as revenue generation within the core where visiting cyclists slow down and could spend more locally than automobile visitors who zoom past. Visitors to Toronto need safe bike infrastructure to travel for tourism and the removal of safe lanes limits tourists without vehicles\n"
