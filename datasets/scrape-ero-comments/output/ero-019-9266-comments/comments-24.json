        "comment": "I strongly oppose this legislation. First, the allocation space within municipally owned public rights of way is fundamentally a local issue best left to municipal councils, not the Province. Second, the criteria is too narrowly focused on movement of motor vehicles and should be focused on moving people agnostic of how they choose to move. Third, the legislation does not consider the broader costs, benefits, and risk of decision-making. Just like Metrolinx justifies the cost and disruption if major transit investments by their long term 30+ year lifecycle benefits\u2014in travel time savings, GHG emissions, safety, etc.\u2014so too must right of way reallocation decisions. This is the fundamental duty of our governments to thing behind the reactionary short term to future generations. Bike lanes in some instances may result in a short term increase in travel times, but the research is overwhelmingly conclusive that route and mode changes occur in the short term to adjust to the new network conditions. And since bike lanes have the potential to carry multiples more people per lane width than auto lanes, and every trip by bike saves OHIP money over the long term (opposite for car trips), it is imperative we set up our networks to encourage this shift, even if there is short term pain. Be bold. At the very least leave these decisions to cities.\n"

        "comment": "The province should not be able to dictate municipal policy. We need more bike lanes, not less. We need more protected bike lanes, wider sidewalks, lanes only for scooters and electric bikes. We need more infrastructure that allows getting around the city without a massive vehicle. I almost exclusively drive because of my disability and the traffic has gotten exponentially worse over the years, this is not because of bike lanes. It is because of the lack of funding for public transit and the lack of infrastructure for bikes and walking. Regardless though, these issues should be up to the municipality, not the provincial government.\n"

        "comment": "The entirety of this bill should be thrown in the trash. There is a mountain of evidence supporting the fact that the only way to reduce vehicular traffic congestion is to provide good quality alternatives. These alternatives are public transportation and cycling. It is unbelievable that this government that strives to reduce red tape, is proposing to create even more red tape. Even worse, this government proposes to spend tax payers money to remove existing bike lanes. I am an Ontario tax payer and if this PC government is about \"Respect for the Taxpayer\" then I feel incredibly disrespected.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 is a ridiculous notion - you are introducing another wasteful layer of oversight on municipalities, who are already doing the studies and consultation required before installing bike lanes. If the government wants to review the studies, they are already there in the public domain.\nIncreasing bureaucracy will not help alleviate congestion - it will slow any efforts to do so, delaying infrastructure that not only may improve traffic flow, but may also make it safer for the public.\n"

        "comment": "Over the past few years, the gradual introduction of bike infrastructure in my city has significantly improved mobility, allowing me and many others to make fewer trips by car. If cities are allowed to continue developing their cycling networks, more people can be encouraged to get out of their cars, reduce overall air pollution, and ease congestion for all road users (including drivers). Research consistently shows that when cities expand their cycling infrastructure, more people are encouraged to bike instead of drive. On the flip side, removing existing bike infrastructure may force me and others in the community to abandon cycling as a mode of transportation altogether. Due to the space inefficiency of the car, reverting cycling infrastructure to car lanes is unlikely to reduce congestion and may actually worsen it. Instead, the government should prioritize ways to encourage people to leave their cars at home. At the provincial level, this should be a continued or increased investment in public transportation.\nAdditionally, I believe that municipalities should have the autonomy to manage their own transportation systems. Local government leaders and urban planners are more familiar with the needs of their communities and so are better equipped to make decisions about bike infrastructure. Provincial intervention undermines the authority of those closest to the issue.\nBy investing in transportation alternatives to cars and allowing cities to continue developing their own bike networks, we can build more efficient transportation systems. I urge the Ontario government to rethink this legislation and prioritize the needs of all road users.\n"

Bike lanes actively reduce the number of cars on the road, which lessens congestion. Bike lanes are crucial for the safety of cyclists as well as the flow of car traffic!\n"

        "comment": "Literally every piece of data says this will make congestion worse, not better\nIf you wanted to improve congestion you'd look at street parking. How many major roads in Toronto have street parking taking up 50% of it? And cycle lanes are the problem?\nYou have four lanes, two of which are parking, two driving lanes. You could *add* a cycle lane, remove parking, and now have 3 24/7 365 driving lanes. Add in the middle lane alternating sides, which already happens in Toronto, and you have two full lanes in rush hour each way and 3 lanes all the time AND the benefits to local business from cyclists alongside taking cars off the road to reduce congestion\nBeyond that, it's *obviously* not the provincial governments responsibility to oversee this - why even have the charade of municipal governments?\n"

        "comment": "I urge the province to back away from challenging existing bike lanes and taking a role in approving new ones. I am a driver, cyclist, transit rider, and pedestrian in Toronto. As a driver, I prefer giving cyclists there own space on the road and as a cyclist, the safety I feel in a dedicated lane is very important to me. Additionally, a direct route, using arterial roads and not winding side streets makes cycling viable. If I had to only bike on side streets that didn't connect well, I may cycle less because it would take longer. That is not a good substitute for a direct bike lane.  A reduction in bike lanes could lead some cyclists to start driving, even worsening road congestion. Removing bike lanes will make Toronto and Ontario look amateurish and short-sighted compared to global cities like New York and Paris that are investing in cycling infrastructure.\n"

Im a resident of downtown Toronto with a car and I bike most of my trips - this isn't a battle against the car - active transportation options are a key to any successful city and REDUCE congestion by providing alternatives. If lanes are removed, I'll drive, adding one additional car to an already congested space - that's how this works.\nPlease focus on what matters and don't the blame of congestion on the cyclist, for god sakes.\n"

        "comment": "This is promising news to combat the bicycle madness at Toronto city hall.  Living in Etobicoke, the implementation of bike lanes on Bloor Street have created substantial traffic bottlenecks and subsequent delays in getting around. As i sit in traffic, where previous to the bike lanes, I never sat and waited before, I take note of the empty bikes lanes, where I rarely see a bicycle during commuting hours.  I seldom do see bikes here but they are usually recreational in nature, not commuters, and do not need to be on a major arterial road.\nThe am saddened this legislation won\u2019t repeal existing bike lanes.   To leave it to the municipality to provide information or statistics on bike lane use is faulty.  I worked for the city for over a decade and know how they work around these issues.  If a staffer is sent to count bikes on any given day, you can rest assured the day time and place of such data collection will be leaked and hundreds of bikes will appear to be counted.  Data collection must be done on a random basis with oversight directly from the province as well.\nThese bike lanes must be moved to a more appropriate location.  They do not work.\n"

Removing bike lanes for cyclists makes it much more dangerous to get around the city.\nEven if you do not feel bike lanes promote safety, it is Provincial over-reach to regulate bike lanes for municipalities. Let each municipality decide for itself what people in that city want.\n"

Reducing bike lanes will only increase traffic as it will force many to commute via driving, carpooling, ttc, etc. plus adding to our air pollution and reducing our air quality (which will have health implications as we age, leading to health consequences and increasing hospital care and bills = more money (what you\u2019re concerned about anyway)). There is no way that removing bike lanes is the solution.. actually do your research please on the satisfaction, cleanliness, air quality, overall health, etc on cities where people mainly commute by bike (e.g., any big city in Europe). And an even better idea try to commute by bike yourself - you might be able to see what it means to others and your health will benefit as well. Let\u2019s no be lazy and promote exercise and movement and a safe environment for all to get to and from work or whatever destination safely.\n"
