        "comment": "I believe the premise of this bill is fundamentally flawed and I would not support/vote for the party that pushes it. Biking lanes in Toronto, if anything, decongested the streets, allowing people to commute faster, healthier and with less environmental impact. There is no evidence that proves that removal of bike lanes will in any way help with gridlocks and time spent in traffic, it will definitely worsen it for folks who use bikes for commuting and will put their lives in danger. This bill is ultimately compromising the country level goal of moving towards better, carbon-free transportation solutions, it undermines people\u2019s belief in the intentions of this country towards solutions regarding climate change. This bill has also surfaced the incompetency of the provincial government and its lack of coordination of infrastructure efforts in its biggest city. While the money has been spent on creating the bike lanes, the money will be spent to remove them with total lack of evidence that this effort is necessary. It does not matter to me that the province plans to reimburse the city of Toronto for spendings associated with placement of bike lanes, because the money provide would provide to the city of Toronto could have been spent in much more productive ways.\n"

        "comment": "I am a pedestrian, a cyclist, a public transportation user and a driver in the City of Toronto.\nTraffic can be slow at peak hours - that isn't going to change with the removal of bike lanes. It will just add more cars to those streets. When I am driving on streets with bike lanes, I am significantly more alert to cyclists sharing the road with me. This means safer turns and lane changes. If I want to minimize my interactions with cyclists, I will change my route to not include streets with bike lanes. As a driver in Toronto, I accept the realities of sharing lanes with cyclists, with slow traffic and I plan my trip accordingly - because I am a responsible adult. I trust that others can do the same.\nAs a cyclist, I avoid streets without bike lanes when at all possible. Bike lanes naturally redirect cyclists to streets with bike lanes because it is safer, meaning less cyclists on other roads to interact with drivers.\nOn streets with bike lanes, as a cyclist - I feel significantly safer! I feel more visible, I feel like I've got more space and I'm less worried about being doored. When I bike on streets without bike lanes, I take up far more space on the road in order to protect myself and ensure I have space.\nLife is very busy, I have to work multiple jobs to afford my basic needs. My bike is ESSENTIAL for me to travel within the city, it keeps my transportation costs down. I don't have the opportunity to get to the gym or exercise classes (both because they are expensive and because I am working more than I should have too to survive), that means my bike is one of the main ways I am physically active. Cycling kills two birds with one stone - I commute to my destination & I get some cardio in.\nMy safety while cycling isn't worth drivers getting to their destination 5, maybe 10minutes earlier.\nAlso, to Doug Ford & the Ontario Conservative government - grow up, get out of municipal politics and instead of recklessly spending out tax payer dollars on ripping up bike lanes, use those funds to invest in health care, affordable housing & education.\nIf Doug Ford and his government decide to bully their way in (again) to Toronto politics, he better come with a cheque to reimburse Toronto for all the money spent on putting the bike lanes in & maintaining them.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 will do NOTHING to reduce gridlock. The way to reduce gridlock is to invest more of the government's funds toward public transit infrastructure, and supporting alternative forms of transportation to cars, like bike lanes and multi-use pathways. The removal of bike lanes will only have a negative impact on people who cannot afford a car or choose to bike as a low-cost, environmentally-friendly option. Increasing lanes of traffic in the city will also increase the amount of traffic proportionally, and thus will not even benefit car owners. This Bill will be a detriment to drivers, bikers, and pedestrians alike.\nInstead of pushing through this harmful Bill, the government should instead direct its funds, resources, and time to improving public transit in Toronto, making it easy for more people to get around by bike, and repairing the Gardiner Expressway.\nIn the \"Environmental Implications\" section, it simply states that \"implications for the environment will be considered.\" This statement is completely meaningless and demonstrates the utter disinterest this government has in improving the living environment for people living in Toronto. Ripping up bike lanes will introduce needless construction to the city, and the opening of further lanes for traffic will bring more car, noise, and air pollution.\nBill 212 is a disaster, and a slap in the face for working class people simply trying to get around in the city where they live.\n"

        "comment": "Keeping the current bike lanes in the city is essential for promoting sustainable transportation, enhancing public safety, and improving overall urban livability. Bike lanes provide a dedicated space for cyclists, reducing the likelihood of accidents involving vehicles and pedestrians. This not only encourages more people to consider biking as a viable commuting option but also helps to decrease traffic congestion and air pollution.\nRemoving these bike lanes would likely lead to an increase in car traffic, which can exacerbate road safety issues and diminish the quality of life for all residents. Moreover, bike lanes contribute to a sense of community by fostering active transportation and encouraging outdoor activity, which is beneficial for both physical and mental health. Maintaining and expanding bike infrastructure aligns with modern urban planning goals aimed at creating more walkable, bike-friendly cities. Let\u2019s prioritize the health of our environment and our communities by preserving and enhancing our bike lanes!\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nI would like to state my opposition to Bill 212 on various grounds. On top of being contrary to the conservative ethos, precedent within urban design shows that Bill 212 will inevitably fail to achieve its goal of \"Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time\".\nFirstly, this policy is a disgraceful overreach on the part of the Ford government. There is no precedent in municipal history within Ontario for the provincial government having such drastic control over how a city conducts itself. As a party that prides itself on governmental restraint, the Conservative party should be ashamed of itself to be so blatantly perpetuated the governmental overreach it proclaims to combat. This policy is against what it means to be a Conservative in Canada.\nAdditionally, the policy also goes against another principal of conservatism, that being that the state should not subsidize private citizens. The argument for the expansion of carcentric infrastructure within Toronto is not within conservative principles: it presumes that the province should expand its reach beyond its defined boundaries to specifically subsidise a certain subset of people (car-owners). Thus, in many ways, Bill 212 is a hypocritical piece of legislature that is NOT compliant with conservative philosophy.\nAdditionally, Bill 212 is not compliant with urban design principles. The creation of more space for cars in the City of Toronto perpetuates a phenomenon known as induced demand: making more space for cars encourages people to purchase and use cars,  which in turn creates more traffic. Contrary to popular thinking, bike lanes actually REDUCE traffic, as people who might take the car otherwise use bike lanes. (https://www.cbc.ca/news/science/bike-lanes-impacts-1.7358319) Bike lanes have a higher capacity for transportation of more people than car lanes do, and thus are a better usage of the city's space than more lanes for cars. The increase in gridlock in Toronto is not in fact a result of bike lanes, but rather that the city's population has increased drastically without accompanying public transit expansion, leaving most regions of the city dependent on cars for travel.\nSupposing the true concern of this bill genuinely is for traffic in the City of Toronto and not an attempt by the Conservative provincial to pander to car-owning suburbanites, the provincial government should actually look into INCREASING the amount of bike lanes, and public transportation within the city. Similarly to bike lanes, subways lines, as well as LRT and BRT, all decrease the amount of congestion on the road. These changes also make the cities more affordable for those who cannot afford a car in an already deeply unaffordable city, create more pleasant neighbourhoods, and reduce pollution both within the city on a global scale.\nBefore implementing this policy, I thus ask that you reconsider its ramifications. Bill 212 is a clear example of government overreach and subsidization of a specific sect of private citizens. Additionally, IT WILL NOT ACTUALLY REDUCE TRAFFIC WITHIN THE CITY OF TORONTO, AND WILL CREATE CREATE FURTHER CONGESTION. If the province is actually interesting in reducing congestion within Toronto, I highly recommend consulting with people who specialise in urban design, as the proponents of this bill clearly do not.\nSigned,\nA Concerned Citizen\n"

        "comment": "Let's talk about why keeping Toronto's bike lanes is essential for the well-being and growth of our city.\nRemoving them, as proposed by Doug Ford, risks unraveling years of progress toward a healthier, more connected, and more vibrant Toronto. Here\u2019s why keeping these lanes matters:\n1. Bike Lanes Make Our Streets Safer for Everyone\nBike lanes make roads safer, not just for cyclists, but for everyone- drivers, pedestrians, and transit riders. According to multiple studies, protected bike lanes can significantly reduce traffic-related injuries. In Toronto, where streets are bustling with diverse road users, dedicated bike lanes help keep everyone moving safely, reducing dangerous encounters between cars, bikes, and pedestrians. Removing these lanes exposes cyclists to higher risks, increases the likelihood of accidents, and makes our city less accessible for those who rely on cycling as their primary mode of transportation.\n2. Economic Benefits Are Significant\nResearch shows that bike lanes are good for business. A study conducted in Bloor West Village found that areas with bike lanes see increased retail foot traffic. People on bikes are more likely to stop and shop, visiting local businesses multiple times compared to car users who might pass by without stopping. Removing bike lanes could hurt local businesses in areas where cycling infrastructure has already made a positive economic impact, slowing down revenue growth and reducing the attractiveness of local storefronts.\n3. Environmental Benefits We Cannot Afford to Lose\nToronto, like cities worldwide, is grappling with the urgent need to combat climate change. Transportation accounts for 35% of our city\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. Bike lanes are a cost-effective, proven way to reduce car dependency, reduce emissions, and improve air quality. Removing them contradicts Toronto\u2019s commitment to sustainability and sends a signal that short-term inconvenience is being prioritized over long-term environmental resilience.\n4. Public Health Benefits We Shouldn\u2019t Overlook\nBike lanes are not just a way to get from A to B; they contribute directly to public health. Studies from cities around the world show that bike lanes encourage people to adopt a more active lifestyle, resulting in improved cardiovascular health, lower obesity rates, and reduced mental health issues. As we emerge from a pandemic that underscored the importance of public health, we need to keep and expand infrastructure that makes physical activity easy, accessible, and safe.\n5. Equity and Accessibility for All Torontonians\nBiking is one of the most affordable forms of transportation. For many Torontonians, particularly those who can\u2019t afford a car or live far from major transit hubs, bike lanes are a lifeline that connects them to work, school, and community resources. Removing bike lanes disregards the needs of lower-income residents who rely on affordable transportation options. Doug Ford\u2019s proposal risks creating a city that prioritizes car owners over everyone else, effectively making Toronto less equitable and inclusive.\n6. Traffic Flow and Congestion Reduction\nCounter to some beliefs, studies show that bike lanes can actually improve traffic flow by reducing the number of cars on the road. Cities like New York and Amsterdam have demonstrated that when cycling infrastructure is robust, car congestion decreases. Toronto is no different; well-designed bike lanes encourage more people to bike, taking cars off the streets and easing congestion, especially during peak hours.\n7. Revitalizing Neighborhoods and Community Life\nBike lanes don\u2019t just move people; they transform neighborhoods. Streets with bike lanes are more likely to have public spaces that feel lively, safe, and inviting, fostering a greater sense of community. Toronto\u2019s bike lanes have already spurred community engagement, connecting neighborhoods and creating more vibrant streetscapes where people want to walk, gather, and spend time. Removing these lanes would be a step backward in our city\u2019s cultural and social development.\nIn Conclusion: Toronto Deserves a Sustainable, Equitable Future\nIn a time when cities worldwide are doubling down on bike infrastructure as a critical solution to modern urban challenges, it would be both short-sighted and harmful for Toronto to backtrack. We owe it to ourselves and future generations to protect and expand our bike lanes, securing a Toronto that\u2019s safe, sustainable, and connected.\nI urge Doug Ford and those considering this decision to think beyond cars and congestion in the short term, especially when relying on exaggerated, limited, and obsolete data. Bike lanes are part of Toronto\u2019s identity, our health, our environment, our economy, and our community well-being.\n"

They just finished construction of the university Avenue bike lanes so it would be a waste of taxpayers money to now remove it shortly after completion. Adding more lanes will result in more cars downtown, so it will not relieve congestion. In the downtown core, we need to incentivize public transit, sidewalks and bike lanes given high density.\n"

        "comment": "It is absolutely insanity for the government to lie about the source of traffic congestion being bicycle lanes. I have been on numerous roads around Toronto without bicycle lanes and bicycles yet they still have congestion. If anything it is the cars in Toronto that are the source of congestion and certainly not the bicycles or bicycle lanes.\nI lived in Madrid Spain and there the government instituted a solution to traffic congestion caused by too many cars by simply allowing license plates ending with even numbers on a day followed by license plates ending with odd numbers on alternating days. This automatically reduced the traffic by 50% and eliminated congestion. Easy. If Ford gets his way I will be enforcing my right to use a car lane with my bicycle and the problem is that I do not ride fast and then cars will have real congestion.\n"

Safe and accessible bike lanes make all of this possible, allowing me to navigate Toronto with confidence and ease.\nI am concerned that removing bike lanes would not only make everyday trips more challenging and less safe for cyclists but would also disrupt the flow of people who contribute to our neighborhoods. Toronto\u2019s bike lanes enable countless residents like me to access local shops and services, bringing steady business to these essential spots in our community.\nI urge you to recognize the vital role that bike lanes play for so many of us and to reconsider any plans that could limit access to safe cycling routes.\nThank you for listening to the perspectives of Toronto cyclists.\n"

        "comment": "Hi I disagree with this proposal\nAll these lanes are recent additions, Toronto takes years to make these decisions after spending time and money on consultation, and now they've spent the money and actually installed them you want to get rid of them? Most of them are a few years old at most. It makes no sense and is not in the least bit fiscally sound.\nIt's also not safe. Have you seen people riding bikes on busy streets without bike lanes? I saw someone nearly sideswiped by a bus on Spadina. My sister just won her insurance claim this month after being injured when a driver didn't look before making a right turn.  My mom was hit when someone opened their car door. I haven't been hit yet but its either my 70 year old father or my turn next. Here's to hoping we survive.\nI expect as a response to this Bill there will be more bikes on sidewalks angering pedestrians, and more drivers mad as cyclists take the lane, as I would advise my fellow cyclists to start doing. We need to refuse to cycle in the gutter in what should be a world class City. We should also try to prevent death and injury, but it seems the province isn't interested in focusing on health or wellness.\nAlso this is a big City. Want to get rid of gridlock? Get rid of snow, construction and people. Can't do that? Then get rid of the cars. In 10 years, once this doesn't work and there's a government not as interested in interfering with City initiatives, how much is it going to cost to redo these lanes?\nI love spending my tax money on political power plays and watching my City fall apart in the process. It's great. Everything's awesome.\nThanks you for your time.\n"

        "comment": "I am shocked by this piece of legislation and oppose it.\nBike lanes are shown to reduce conjestion and increase safety for cyclists. Cities all over the world and Canada are increasing bike lanes to help create a safer environment for all pedestrians. I live on a bike lane that is well connected to the major Thames Valley Parkway in London Ontario. This lane is used very frequently. Other lanes in the city would be used as well, if only they were connected to the major pathways. Unfortunately, the paths are not linked in a way that makes cyclists feel safe using them.\nLondon could be a major destination for cycling tourism with a few more lanes. The Thames Valley Parkway is world class. It needs winter maintenence and better connections with outer parts of the city.\nI cycle with my children and I would like there to be increased safety for myself and my kids. Just yesterday, a 13 year old was killed by a car  in Ajax. Bike lanes are shown to decrease speeds on roads which increases safety for pedestrians and those in cars. Speed decreases lead to lower impacts in crashes and lower fatalities and injuries.\nCongestion in cities is a factor of induced demand more than any other cause. Induced demand for road travel can be broadly defined as \u2018the increment in new vehicle traffic that would\nnot have occurred without the improvement of the network capacity\u2019.\nThis legislation is a waste of tax payers money and will do nothing to increase travel time for cars in any city in Ontario.\n"
