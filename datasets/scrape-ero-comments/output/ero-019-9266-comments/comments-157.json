        "comment": "This proposal is utterly ridiculous. The province is not best positioned to understand the needs of individual communities. This is gross overstepping of provincial power. We elect municipal government to determine local needs. In the case of removing bike lanes, these lanes were purchased by local taxes. How dare the provincial govt waste hard earned tax dollars. This is a preposterous waste. Let the people locally determine what they believe is the right solution for their area.\nIn terms of environment, we should be PROMOTING non-gas powered forms of transportation. More bike lanes, not less. I have been to Amsterdam. Stunning infrastructure for bikes. Children bike to school. No school buses, even in rural areas.\nInstead of law, perhaps consider guidelines for consideration when new lanes are implemented. Look to solutions such as implemented in UK.\nIf Toronto is having traffic troubles, let TORONTO deal with it. Leave the rest of Ontario alone.\n"

        "comment": "I am absolutely opposed to building the 413, particularly because it will destroy farmland and wetlands. With Climate Change and the potential for supply chain interruptions, it's important we have food sources close to our urban centres. Paving over green spaces, not only takes away food production but also increases the risk of devastating floods.\nThe reality is the Conservative government should never have sold the 407, which was a terrible waste of taxpayer dollars.\nTo confirm, I am totally against the proposed building of highway 413 and the provincial government over-reach when it comes to bike lanes in our urban centres.\nStay in your lane, as they say...\nThank you for your consideration.\nR.\n"

        "comment": "If the province is so concerned about traffic, when will they hold Metrolinx to account on their numerous failures to deliver mass transit? Getting these projects running is not only the actual business of the province, but it's also far more likely to actually improve the flow of traffic by providing alternatives to putting more cars on the road.\nMoreover, the province has no business interfering in matters of municipal concern, and it's surprising where they think they'll find the time given the aforementioned transport issues that are explicitly their responsibility. If Ontario's many city councils are truly ill-advised in their transport planning let them suffer the ire of their constituents directly and on election day.\nIf the premier or the transport minister sincerely believe they've run out of problems to solve at the provincial level, then let them spend their idle time waiting to catch the Eglinton Crosstown.\n"

        "comment": "This is a terrible plan and a significant form of overreach into municipal politics.  It is municipalities which have the best data and capacity to plan where bike lanes should be installed.   This will have no effect on gridlock and will make life more dangerous for the people who ride bicycles.  The plan to have each bike lane submitted for review through the province is a bureaucratic nightmare.  How will the department of transportation handle the increased volume of requests, how will they understand the hyper local context of a proposed bike lane?  This is all a huge waste of money which will not make a difference to ending gridlock.  The provincial government leaves housing to the municipalities but uploads responsibility for bike lanes.  The provincial government is playing politics with the safety of thousands.  Do not implement this bill.\n"

        "comment": "I think this bill is an over-reach of provincial government and it is clearly a political stunt designed as a wedge issue for urban and suburban voters. Its embarrassing and disgusting that instead of dealing with real issues this government chooses to wedge Ontario residents apart for political gain. Absolutely disappointing and a step backwards for Ontario.\n"
