        "comment": "As a citizen of the province on Ontario, I don't often get to allocate time to provide my perspective on the things that matter to me; even those things that directly impact me. Frankly, because there is just so much of it; and so little I get to be made aware of it; and, of course, time.\nSo it pleases me to be able to add my voice to this; what I've been able to glean. Bill 212, or at least part of it, wants to assist in motorvehicle congestion - Toronto specifically; strangely... or ironically Doug? - by undoing and preventing the creation of alternative transportation (bicycles are the reference) dedicated 'roads'... especially when it comes to the redesignation of a motorvehicle road lane into a non-motorvehicle road lane. It somehow believes (this Bill... it has beliefs; now you know) that this will HELP reduce congestion. I STRONGLY DISAGREE.\n\"PRESCRIBED municipalities would be required to seek provincial approval to allow for the implementation of new bicycle lanes that require the removal of an existing lane of traffic. Approval will be based on a set of specified criteria, to be set out in guidance and/or regulation.\" Bill 212 would force municipal government to be contrained by provincial government. It will even give the province permission to force them to undo things they've done. I STRONGLY DISAGREE.\nAs I'm unclear how one differentiates municipalities between those that have a prescription and those who don't... I'm unclear who or what a prescribed municipality even means....\nAreas of Ontario like Toronto, Ottawa, and others that experience motorvehicle traffice congestion:\n1. Will NOT be helped by removing what has already been installed;\n2. Will NOT be helped by having contraints put on them because of a political agenda - what other valid reason does the province have? Truly, please tell me why this level of control/ oversight is needed.\n3. Will have GREATER, NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS if we don't add in more infrastructure changes that make commuting options - all of them - more in line with: mass transportation options & zero (environmentally harmful) emission options.\nI really hope Bills like this one are thrown out. This is a waste. Please make things better, not worse.\n"

        "comment": "As a driver and biker in the city I find this to be an outrageous waste of money that will only endanger people. Bikers will continue to bike and now they will have to share a lane with cars further slowing down traffic. Also these lanes were only recently put in and this money could be much better spent on education, healthcare and transit. Grid lock in this city cannot be blamed on bicycles. Cars create traffic. Invest in transit to solve this problem please.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 has the stated goal of reducing gridlock, saving Ontarians time, however there is no evidence to suggest any of the steps proposed will actually reduce gridlock, on the contrary it will increase congestion, by making it unsafe and inefficient traverse our cities and towns by any means other an automobile.\n\tBy limiting the installation of new bike lanes, the government is prioritizing the convenience of one group, motorists, over that of another, cyclists. This is despite there being no evidence to suggest that removing bike lanes in favour of additional lanes for cars will reduce travel times. There is a multitude of evidence showing that adding additional lanes for automobiles will not reduce congestion, as it simply induces more demand. This ultimately leads to more cars on the road, resulting in more pollution and more congestion. Just look at highway 401 for evidence of this, one of the largest highways in North America is still rife with congestion because adding more lanes in place of a viable alternative to driving has resulted in more people driving.\n\tThis same principle holds true for good bike infrastructure, build it and they will come. Instead of being forced into ripping up existing bike infrastructure, municipalities should be allowed to build out robust, well-connected bike infrastructure. Much of Ontario's bike infrastructure is in its infancy, many of the lanes are difficult to access and may not go between where people live and work. One wouldn't drive a car on a road that goes nowhere, how can someone be expected to ride a bike. Forcing bike lanes onto side streets is not a solution to this problem as the layouts of our cities and towns no longer follow a walkable grid but feature meandering subdivisions that go nowhere to cater to drivers. This means traffic, be it car, bike, or pedestrian, cannot be diverted away from major arteries as the alternatives are laughably inefficient.\n\tThe solution is to expand the bike infrastructure, not tear it out. Look at the success of this practice in places like the Netherlands, Paris, Belgium, and even Montreal. If biking can become a safe, practical alternative to driving, it will give people another choice in their commute besides purchasing an expensive car, or taking what is often underfunded public transit.\n\tFurthermore, the notion that the provincial government believes it can govern Ontario communities more effectively than the government those communities elected to govern themselves is laughable and an insult to the notion of democracy. All politics should serve local interests first. The idea that the provincial government would use its power to force municipalities to spend millions tearing up infrastructure they have already spent millions to install is spitting in the face of fiscal responsibility.\n"

        "comment": "The bike lanes have been build with tax payers money - now they should be removed? I can barely think of a more wasteful way to use taxes. Besides that, getting rid of the bike lanes won't solve any traffic jams - induced demand will just lead to more cars on the road and more gridlock. What this province needs is better public transit and more bike lanes, not less.\n"

        "comment": "Things that cause traffic congestion include too many vehicles, excessive large vehicles, on street parking, stopped vehicles, left turning vehicles, right turning vehicles, poorly trained drivers and very poorly trained commercial drivers.\nRemoving bike lanes will not remove bikes from the road - and will ultimately do nothing to decrease congestion.\nLeave city planning to cities.\nThe province should focus on better funding transit, getting the LONG overdue Eglinton LRT operational and improving existing highway infrastructure.\n"

        "comment": "Research consistently shows that cities with robust cycling infrastructure have safer streets for everyone. Protected bike lanes, in particular, create clear delineations between drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians, reducing the likelihood of collisions and enhancing overall traffic safety. Studies in North America and Europe confirm that bike-friendly cities have lower traffic injury and fatality rates for all road users, not just cyclists. For example, data from New York City and Vancouver show that protected bike lanes reduce collisions and injuries for cyclists and drivers alike. Safer streets contribute to stronger communities, as residents are more likely to feel comfortable and confident using active transportation when they know they are protected.\nMoreover, bike lanes help calm traffic, which reduces speeding and aggressive driving. This, in turn, creates a safer environment not only for cyclists but for drivers and pedestrians as well. Implementing bike lanes thus becomes a comprehensive approach to enhancing road safety\u2014a key responsibility of any government dedicated to public welfare.\nI and my wife mostly commute downtown via biking. We do not feel safe without quality protected bike lanes - especially at night. Removing bike lanes would restrict our options to get into the city.\n"

        "comment": "This is such a waste of public money and resources. We need bikes lanes and we do not need extra bureaucracy standing in the way of bike lanes. I commute on a bike and use a bike for errands, it is safer to have bike lanes. Drivers do not share the road. I can no longer count the number of times that I have almost been hit because the driver is doing something illegal or is being impatient. In a collision between a car and a bike, who is going to be unharmed? The driver of the car. The cyclist will likely be dead.\nThe bike lanes on University in Toronto are fantastic. It is not the bike lanes that are the problem for congestion. It is the construction for the underground transit projects. That construction is supposed to be temporary.\nHighway 413 is a waste as well. It will permanently scar our landscape, kill animals and habitats, destroy farm land and lives. We do not need more highways. We need better ways to move people - trains, busses, e-bikes, cycling infrastructure.\nUnfortunately, the current government is only beholden to its capitalist friends and cannot see the future. Perhaps it should actually be a government for the people, not just wealthy capitalist people.\nActive Transportation Advocate\nBurlington ON\n"

As a biker, I choose routes that include dedicated bike lanes for my safety and wellbeing because drivers are awful and put me at risk of an accident.\nBike lanes help reduce traffic by offering safe routes for alternative travel. Removing these safe bike lanes means people will be less likely to cycle for their commute, thus increasing road congestion.\nRemoving bike lanes also pushes bikes from the roads onto sidewalks, making it unsafe for pedestrians. As a parent to two young children, I want to know we\u2019re safe from being run over by bikes and scooters on the sidewalk.\nWe do not need more car lanes to beat road congestion.

Congestion will only be reduced if you give people robust and safe alternatives to driving.  Bike lanes are an investment in a sustainable future and will take time to yield benefits.  On the other hand, new car lanes will immediately be as congested as the current ones.  Let municipalities set their own priorities.  Please reconsider this policy.\n"

Cycling can be a reasonable alternative to driving, when the proper infrastructure is in place. If you remove existing infrastructure and slow the development of new infrastructure through increased bureaucracy, you make cycling harder and directly increase traffic. Please reconsider, as your proposal runs directly counter to your stated goals.\n"
