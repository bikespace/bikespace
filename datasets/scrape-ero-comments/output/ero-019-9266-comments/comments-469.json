Maintaining and reverting traffic lanes will only serve to prolong the problems we are facing of gridlock and long commutes, and will jeopardize the safety of cyclists in the process. On this matter, municipalities know what is best to meet the needs of their residents and business communities, and create healthier cities.\n"

All these occurred when there were no bike lanes.\nIn my last 3 years of commuting, bike lanes were installed and it instantly became safer and I no longer felt threatened and vulnerable. No incidents in 3 years!\nI also take the same roads at times with my car and witnessed that the bike lanes did not impede or slow traffic,  it is evident the impediment to traffic as it is the population growth in our cities are causing the traffic woes.  The 2001 Ottawa population was  774,072, in 2021 it was  1,017,449.  That is a whopping 31% increase in population.\nAt the same time in the last 3 years since bike lanes,   I saw a 200% increase in bike commuters as safe bike lanes were built, and a lack of locker and bike rack space in our building became a problem over the same period.  My office remained the same occupancy, so it is the availability of bike lanes that brought in more bike commuters.\nRemoving existing bike lanes goes against reducing traffic.  Mixing bikes with traffic will cause accidents which will \"stop\" traffic.\nUse the volumes of data from around the world to make policy, do not base policy on a frustrated car commuter focusing on the 4 feet of road space used by thousands of cyclists as the city grows 30%.\n"

There is absolutely no evidence to the claim that bike lanes increase traffic and substantial evidence to the contrary -- this has been proved time and time again in cities across the world. To waste our funding at a time when wait lists for family doctors are thousands long and our schools are in trouble -- and to waste it on something as  incredibly ill-conceived as this is shameful.\n"

        "comment": "This is a poorly conceived Bill, on a number of fronts.\nFirst, it is over-reach by a higher level of government into the affairs of the most local level. Municipal governments are best suited to understand and respond to the transportation of the needs of their citizens within a city.\nSecond, it runs contrary to all evidence. The most effective way to combat gridlock is not to add car lanes or remove bike lanes, thereby pushing people to drive more often. This only exacerbates the problems. What works all over the world, and yes, in Ontario, is to offer safe, efficient and attractive alternatives to the motor vehicle. By giving those who CAN take a bicycle for some of their trips the ability to do so in greater safety, more people will choose to take such trips more often.\nThird, this is the most economically inefficient way to move people. Building and maintaining lanes for motor vehicle use is a poor use of taxpayer dollars and of scarce space in dense cities, when walking, cycling and transit are far more efficient.\nFourth, it is based on the assumption that most people have access to a motor vehicle, can afford to own and operate one and pay for parking, and that they wish to use a car as opposed to a mode that offers greater freedom, fitness and flexibility.\nAll over the world, cities are shifting to prioritizing the use of the bicycle for more trips, and are saving money, freeing up space and reducing congestion. Restricting the construction of bicycle lanes or, worse, eliminating ones that have already been built at great cost and with strong community support is simply short-sighted and an example of big government imposing its will on the citizen.\nI thank you for considering my evidence-based comments. I have researched this issue all over the world. produced a documentary film on the topic (Bike City, Great City) and served eight years on City Council in Ottawa where the overwhelming majority of citizens and voters support more bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes is not only a waste of public money, but also going to achieve the exact opposite of what this bill intends to do. Less cyclists on the road means more cars, means more traffic. This is in addition to the higher traffic that will be caused while the demolition/construction is taking place.\nIt is also a massive overreach for the Ontario government to interfere with cities this way. More red tape for cities is not the way to improve things.\n"

        "comment": "Opposition to Ontario Bill 212: Prioritizing Safe and Sustainable Transportation\nI am firmly opposed to Ontario Bill 212 (Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024) for several compelling reasons. This legislation\u2019s proposal to remove bike lanes as a strategy to alleviate traffic congestion is fundamentally misguided and lacks substantial evidence to support its effectiveness. Rather than easing congestion, this policy is likely to lead to adverse outcomes, compromising both public safety and sustainable urban development.\nHistorical Lessons: Removing Bike Lanes Does Not Ease Congestion\nToronto\u2019s own history with similar measures demonstrates why this proposal is likely to fail. In 2011, bike lanes were removed from Jarvis Street with the aim of improving traffic flow; however, the city\u2019s own data subsequently revealed increased travel times and slower traffic\u2014precisely the opposite of what was intended. This precedent underscores the ineffectiveness of eliminating bike lanes as a means of reducing gridlock. Instead, it risks pushing more people toward car dependency, exacerbating congestion and increasing the strain on road infrastructure.\nPublic Health and Safety Risks\nRemoving bike lanes endangers cyclists and other vulnerable road users. The absence of dedicated lanes for cyclists has been shown to increase accidents, injuries, and fatalities. These preventable incidents result in higher healthcare costs, emergency response expenses, and legal fees\u2014all of which ultimately burden taxpayers. Protecting bike lanes is not only a matter of safety but also an economically sound choice that reduces long-term public health expenditures.\nPromoting Sustainable and Multimodal Transportation\nSustainable urban planning should prioritize multimodal transportation solutions, encouraging walking, cycling, and public transit over car dependency. Bill 212 moves us further from these goals by diminishing the infrastructure for safe, sustainable travel options. As global cities increasingly adopt green policies and expand biking infrastructure, Ontario risks lagging behind, both in terms of environmental responsibility and in creating a livable, accessible city for all residents.\nAlternative Investments for the Greater Good\nRather than dismantling urban infrastructure, the province should direct resources toward initiatives that offer broad, lasting benefits. By investing in healthcare, education, and efficient public transit systems, Ontario can address core issues affecting residents\u2019 quality of life while also easing congestion more effectively. Such measures would serve the long-term interests of Ontarians far better than temporary, reactionary fixes aimed solely at accommodating suburban commuters and drivers.\nConclusion: A Step Backward for Ontario\nBill 212 is ultimately a step backward for Ontario\u2019s cities and communities. Sustainable, inclusive urban planning calls for policies that prioritize safety, efficiency, and environmental stewardship. By preserving and expanding bike lanes, the government can foster a safer, more accessible cityscape that supports all modes of transport and contributes to a cleaner environment. Rather than catering solely to drivers, Ontario should adopt forward-thinking policies that build a resilient, inclusive future for all its residents.\n"

        "comment": "This law is completely ridiculous, trading people's lives for political points. Of course bike lanes appear empty, 100 bikes per hour is far less visible than 70 cars per hour because bikes are much much smaller. The lanes on Eglinton aren't used because the small sections that exist today are only a few blocks long and connect to nothing, as they are incomplete. I drive far more than I bike, and as a driver I love it when bicycles are completely out of my way instead of darting in and out of the gutter to dodge parked cars where no bike lanes exist. It's safer for them and me to have their own space. The current provincial government takes more time off than anyone, and yet somehow is supposed to have time to take over the minutia of city business? How about you focus on schools and healthcare, the stuff that you are actually supposed to be doing.\n"

Bike lane infrastructure provides safe and climate friendly modes of transportation. A good system of bike infrastructure will mean less cars in the road.  This and good reliable public transportation are what is needed to reduce gridlock.  Back off and let municipal govts plan the infrastructure that they determine aid needed.

        "comment": "I am curious what the rationale behind Bill 212 was, because none of the proposed actions make sense to me.\nI also recognize the need to \"get people and goods out of gridlock and save drivers and businesses time and money.\"  However, I have a hard time believing there is any research or data that supports the solution to this being building priority highways.  A much more efficient solution would be to further develop a comprehensive public transit system which could use the roads we already have and transport many people in one vehicle.  This also has the added benefit of reducing our collective carbon footprint, which can only be a good thing.\nAgain, I also recognize \"that accidents and lane closures can worsen traffic congestion and impact the quality of life of Ontarians.\"  And again, I do not see how removing bike lanes will help with this.  People will ride bikes no matter what, and by putting cyclists back on the road intermingling with vehicles the chances of accidents will be increased.  Not to mention the slowing down of traffic which occurs when cars get stuck behind slower cyclists.  By creating separate lanes for bikes, car traffic can move more freely and everyone is safer.\nTo whoever is in charge of deciding if this bill goes through, I suggest two things:\n- Take a day and cycle around downtown Toronto.  Use bike lanes and also roads without and see how you feel.\n- Look up the work and writings of the iconic Jane Jacobs, who knew decades ago that the car-centric approach is a mistake.\nIn the words of Jacobs herself, \u201cCities have the capability of providing something for everybody, only because, and only when, they are created by everybody.\u201d\nLet's make sure everyone's voice is heard and respected!\n"

Supporting the infrastructure to do these things safely contributes to a healthier population and a healthier planet. It also helps the economy via making short trips to local stores easier. Bike lanes are a key piece of city infrastructure that should be supported, not vilified.\nI do not support the removal of bike lanes. I also do not support a provincial government having authority over whether the city I live in chooses to implement bike lanes or not.\n"

The alternative is building the proposed highway 413 which will pave over farmland, take many years to build with cost overuns and minimize the environmental review process. Building additional lanes and highways does not reduce gridlock, individual drivers in cars commuting long distances to work cause gridlock.\nRegarding regional and city roads that have installed bicycle lanes after following their own review processes. Why should the provincial government step in to force them to retract their process, if the province oversteps its boundaries, I assume the provincial government will pay for the removal of the bicycle lanes.\n"

The bike lanes benefit us all by keeping everyone safe and moving. Forcing the people of Toronto to endure even more construction to remove existing bike infrastructure and requiring a regressive, car-first streetscape is inexcusable foolishness.\n"
