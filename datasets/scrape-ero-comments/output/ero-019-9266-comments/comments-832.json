        "comment": "I have been a resident in the Queen\u2019s Park District/Bay Cloverhill Community Association (BCCA) area for the last 26 years. The boundaries of the BCCA are Queen\u2019s Park, Queen\u2019s Park Crescent West, College Street, Yonge Street and Charles Street West. See:\nBay Cloverhill Community Association - Bay Cloverhill Community Association\nThe Ontario Legislative building sits within this mixed use community.\nI have seen the neighbourhood grow from 4, 000 residents to more than 18, 000 residents. When I first moved into the area there were narrow sidewalks, no cycling infrastructure and no Toronto Bike Share stations. When the BCCA members did cycling counts to support the creation of bike lanes on Wellesley Street we talked to the children, college and university students, health care workers, office workers, and seniors cycling on the street. They often mentioned how unsafe that they felt cycling in mixed traffic. Protected cycling routes were mentioned as a way to make all the major Streets such as Wellesley Street, University Avenue/Queen\u2019s Park, Yonge Street, College Street and Bloor Street safer for all transportation users.\nFrom doing litter clean ups, graffiti removal, forming a Friends of Queen\u2019s Park group and working on six community gardens in the area I have gotten to know my neighbourhood very well. I have seen a massive increase in people walking and cycling in the area. I have seen more of the parking spaces in residential buildings in the area become unused and the bike storage rooms having to expand capacity due to much higher demand from cyclists. I have watched families with children grow up and decide to stay in the area because of its amenities and active and safe active transportation options.\nFive years ago I was nearby killed while cycling southbound on Queen\u2019s Park in the curb lane just south of the ROM. The road then did not have any painted or delineated cycling infrastructure. The road was slick from a light early evening rain. I could see people in Queen\u2019s Park ahead recreating in the park. Three vehicles were drag racing southbound on Avenue Road and Queen\u2019s Park. The vehicles started to skid as they approached the north end of Queen\u2019s Park. I was in the curb lane and had to fall on the curb to not get hit by the speeding and skidding vehicles. One of the vehicles went air bound, rolled ,collided with and destroyed a mature tree and park bench in Queen\u2019s Park. The driver and passenger jumped out of the car and ran, not even caring if they might have killed someone on the road or park.\nWhen the pilot bike lanes and later cycle track was put in on Queen\u2019s Park, Queen\u2019s Park Crescent West and East and University Avenue speeding dropped significantly. The area is much safer pedestrians, cyclists, transit users and drivers. This cycling infrastructure keeps our large food delivery by bike workers safe and efficient.\nMy profession is City Planning. Complete streets implement City Council approved Vision Zero objectives and make streets safer for all transportation users \u2013 drivers, pedestrians, cyclists and transit users. Cycling infrastructure attracts young talent to the GTA. Researchers like Richard Florida (The Rise of the Creative Class) and companies like Amazon know this. Complete streets and cycling infrastructure make for a more economically competitive GTA. If Ontarians have transportation options that include active transportation they will have more money available to buy housing.\nI am a senior working full time. My primary mode of transportation is by bike \u2013 both Toronto Bike Share and my own bike. I choose to not own a car. The removal of the complete streets on University Avenue, Yonge Street and Bloor Street will put my life and others at risk daily by having to cycle in mixed traffic. I ask the sections of Bill 212 that relate to removal of the cycle tracks on University Avenue , Yonge Street and Bloor Street or references to the removal of any cycling infrastructure in Ontario be taken out of the proposed legislation.\n"

It is basically setting Ontario back decades in deciding to remove bike lanes at a time when we crucially need to decarbonize and reduce stress on our already overused and underfunded road systems.\nHowever, it is unscrupulous to try and sneak in highway 413 into this bill. This highway would ruin prime farmland in Ontario and create tremendous challenges to the watershed. I am vehemently against this as I am a fan of sustainable Ontario farming and access to clean, uncontaminated water. This highway is an environmental disaster and I cannot in good conscience remain silent on this true tragedy.\n"

        "comment": "To Whom It May Concern,\nI am writing to express my strong opposition to Bill 212 due to its implications for road safety and environmental sustainability.\nFirstly, Bill 212 raises serious road safety concerns. Prohibiting the installation of new bike lanes if motor vehicle lanes are removed, and removing heavily used bike lanes that provide viable commuting options for urban residents will have minimal impact on gridlock, but it will make roads less safe for all users, and will deter people from choosing more sustainable modes of transportation that  would reduce congestion. Supporting safe infrastructure such as bike lines should be a priority, and any policy that risks increasing accidents or injuries is unacceptable.\nAdditionally, the environmental implications of Bill 212 are deeply worrying. By exempting the proposed Highway 413 from the Greenbelt Plan and the Environmental Assessment Act, irrevocable damage will be done to local ecosystems and habitats, and the Green Belt as a whole,  jeopardizing the health and well-being of future generations.\nAs a parent, I want to see policies that improve safety, protect the environment and support sustainability for our children and future generations.\nI urge the provincial government to reconsider Bill 212 and engage in meaningful consultation with municipalities, environmental experts, and community members. Ontario needs policies that prioritize safety, sustainability, and local input to build a better future for all residents.\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\n"

This bill is against democracy, against the freedom to choose how to travel around the city, against the freedom over our own land, against the environment, and against the people of Ontario. Studies have shown bikes lanes are great for the environment, travel times, and business. Look at the studies and letters in this comment. Bikes lanes do not cause traffic. Environmental assessments need to be done by governments, and Highway 413 does not need more powers to steal land from Ontarians.\n"

        "comment": "Regarding the proposed amendments to Part XII: I am deeply concerned about the negative impact this legislation would have on cyclist safety and sustainable transportation initiatives in our community and across Ontario.\nI strongly reject the arguments presented by the Conservative government in support of this bill, which seem to be rooted in short-sighted concerns about traffic congestion and parking availability.\nThe MTO is all about being safe - they have rigid traffic control plans and mandatory safety requirements for their workers, contractors, or suppliers that work on Ontario roads. They do not take this issue lightly. In fact, as published in the 2021 Ontario Road Safety Annual Report forward, \"we are committed to improving safety for all drivers and passengers on our roads.\"\nThis proposed change in legislation goes against this core value of the MTO, which is related to keeping people safe. The focus is not safety - it is getting drivers to their destination faster and quicker, and safety is now no longer the MTO's priority. It begs Ontarians like myself to question - what other shortcuts is the MTO taking regarding the public's safety? If this bill is passed, it will be  clear to me that the MTO no longer puts safety as a priority.\nNo other provincial government in Canada has decision-making abilities over bike lane planning or placement. Why now must the Ontario Government feel they have to control this? It is truly a decision of the municipality and the population of that municipality when and where these bike lanes can and should be placed. For example, the MTO does not regulate where large shoulders should be placed to accommodate horse and buggy vehicles because this is not a province-wide issue. Selected communities in Ontario have a Mennonite population and they have specific requirements locally on accommodating these transportation needs.\nWe, as individuals, residents of Ontario, Canada, and the world, need to change our habits to adjust to the changing climate. It means we have to stop getting into our cars and try other forms of sustainable transportation. Expanding a bike lane network in any city is a continuing step to making these positive changes to help our climate. Removing these and adding more traffic lanes is a huge step back. Research consistently demonstrates that well-designed cycling infrastructure not only enhances safety for cyclists but also improves overall traffic flow and reduces congestion in the long term (Toronto Centre for Active Transportation, 2018). Additionally, studies show that businesses in areas with protected bike lanes tend to see an increase in sales, driven by greater foot and bicycle traffic (New York City Department of Transportation, 2014). These facts contradict the government\u2019s claims that bike lanes negatively impact local businesses and inconvenience motorists.\nI strongly urge you to remove the amendments to Part XII from Bill 212. This is not a provincial issue. Ontario has 444 municipalities. There is one municipality - the City of Toronto, which appears to be the reason for this change in legislation. The remaining 443 do not apply. Keep local issues at the municipal level and keep Ontario-wide issues at the provincial level.\n"

        "comment": "I am deeply concerned about Bill 212 and the Highway 413 Act. The former constitutes massive overreach of the provincial government into municipal affairs and both bills fail to address their stated goals, while putting public health and safety and the environment at risk.\nThe proposed Highway 413 cuts straight through the Greenbelt, impacting farmland, wetlands, and many at-risk species of flora and fauna; yet Bill 212 seeks to grant this project an exemption from the Environmental Assessment Act.\nAt a time when food prices are skyrocketing, do we really want to raze prime farmland?\nAt a time when extreme weather is only getting worse and more frequent, do we really want to pave over our watersheds and increase flooding risk?\nFurthermore, the highway will not even improve traffic in the long term. Induced demand is a well-studied phenomenon that we saw play out with highway 401. At best, highway 413 will provide temporary relief, but it will push more people to commute by car and the housing developments that will likely follow its construction will fill up the roads.\nIf the Ontario government really cares about reducing car traffic, they should be implementing and improving alternatives to driving. This is the most reliable method to reduce the number of cars on the road. Yet, Bill 212 seeks to hamper the ability of municipalities to build new bike lanes.\nRequiring provincial approval for any new bike lane that takes away a lane of traffic would seriously delay many bike infrastructure projects. Municipal governments are better equipped to analyse and understand the needs of their constituents. When the Ontario government seems obsessed with expediting the construction of a new freeway, why do they not extend this consideration to bike lanes? Bike lanes are part of building a strong network of transportation infrastructure that is safe and accessible to all Ontarians.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212, as drafted and tabled by the Progressive Conservative government under Premier Doug Ford, is fundamentally flawed in it's logic, lacks any science- or evidence-based credibility or merit, and must not be passed.\nThis proposed legislation goes against decades of well-documented research studies of traffic congestion regarding induced demand and traffic evaporation that prove:\n- bike lanes are good for adjacent businesses\n- bike lanes are great for people's health and well-being\n- bike lanes as part of complete streets create livable cities and towns\nThe existing bike lanes on Bloor St, Yonge St and University Ave absolutely must remain. The Province of Ontario must not spend any taxpayer dollars to remove existing bike lanes or other cycling infrastructure.\nSince Bill 212 was introduced, the cycling community in Toronto and across municipalities in Ontario has voice its strong oppososition to the bill, expressing calling out the need for more, not less, safe cycling infrastrucutre including separated bike lanes. BIAs in Toronto have stated their evidence-based support for bike lanes. The medical community stated its science-based support for bike lanes. The Mayor, Deputy Mayor and many Toronto City councillors have stated their fiscally responsible support for bike lanes.\nIf the Province of Ontario insists on overreach, instead of Bill 212, the Province of Ontario through the Ministry of Transportation, should be mandating that municipalities rapidly build active transportation infrastructure including separated cycling infrastructure in the context of the climate emergency and the need to rapidly reduce GHG emissions from motorized vehicles.\nThe government of Ontario should provide funding, currently allocated to unnecessary and environmentally destructive 400-series highway expansion, to municipalities across the province to build complete streets and active transportation infrastructure including separated bike lanes.\n"

The personal health impact of cycling: increased personal fitness, positive mental health.

        "comment": "The move to remove bike lanes from within the city of Toronto flies in the face of the very name of the bill, as it does not address the root cause of gridlock but rather is reducing part of the solution to it.\nAs someone who drives through the city regularly, it would seem that the inability to efficiently come in and out of the city via our major arteries (Gardiner expressway, 401) is a major culprit for the gridlock felt within the city itself. Adding one lane of capacity for stretches of inner city streets is not going to change the fact that nothing is moving on the highways in and out. The city is currently bounded by roads that are overcapacity particularly during the current ongoing gardiner construction. Removing bike lanes within the city does not change this.\nThe cost to remove these bike lanes, which were recently implemented, is an additional backstep. The money could very much more productively be applied to improving our transit system within the city, improving the transit system in and out of the city of Toronto and for that matter across the province. If more people were able to easily commute in and out of the city via trains, and then get to where they needed to go via public transit, there would be less cars on the road and the very cause of the gridlock we experience would begin to be addressed. The root cause of the gridlock problem in the city is the lack of mobility provided by alternatives to the car, such as public transit of bicycles. Removing bike lanes is not the answer.\nThis would seemingly be common sense, something the federal conservative party touts as their mantra. Perhaps the Ontario PC's should get on board with common sense and stop making decisions based on who's pockets their hands are currently in.\n"

        "comment": "I work at a traffic engineering company, so I\u2019ve got lots of experience with traffic patterns and historical traffic all around the GTA. As a result, I know that at most locations, traffic increases about 0.5% to 2% each year. And this makes sense: most areas of the GTA are increasing in population, and more people typically means more driving. As a result, many of the traffic studies that I do show that traffic is getting slightly worse each year.\nIt\u2019s admirable that the government wants to fix this. However, I\u2019d like to discuss the one area of the GTA that has already fixed this situation. This area does not have a positive growth rate in traffic, meaning that despite the increase in population, they aren\u2019t facing ever-increasing congestion. This area is downtown Toronto. This might sound strange, considering that downtown does experience congestion. But my point here is that downtown Toronto is the only place where the data consistently shows growth in the neighbourhood in general, i.e. economic growth, building development, etc. without an increase in traffic. Everywhere else, new growth means new traffic and new congestion and there's no good end game when those two things are tied together.\nThis obviously raises the question of why downtown Toronto isn\u2019t facing the year-over-year traffic growth that is threatening to cripple the GTA (and other parts of Ontario). The reason is that the other ways of getting around, like the subway, GO trains, walking, and biking, are actually good in downtown Toronto. The transit is good because it actually shows up more than once every 15 minutes, unlike in the rest of the GTA, and the long-distance transit actually travels fast. Walking is good because there are large sidewalks, narrow streets, and lots of storefronts, restaurants, entertainment venues, residences, and jobs all close together. All these destinations also makes biking good, along with the excellent Bike Share system and the protected bike infrastructure like the lanes you are currently targeting.\nIf you don\u2019t want to trust me, then listen to any of the other transportation, engineering, and city planner experts. The Ontario Professional Planners Institute knows when and where bike lanes are appropriate, and they disagree with the proposed law. Professional Engineers Ontario knows when and where bike lanes are appropriate, and they disagree with the proposed law. The Ontario Traffic Council knows when and where bike lanes are appropriate, and they disagree with the proposed law. Why does the Conservative Party think they are more knowledgeable that these organizations?\nAgain, I very much appreciate that your party is willing to explore options, take action, and spend taxes to try to fix traffic. But government after government has tried to fix traffic and failed. In order to succeed in fixing traffic, you are going to need to work with knowledgeable experts and not push through ham-fisted, one-size-fits-all laws.\n"

I live right on Bloor (across from High Park) and having bike lanes that have removed 2 critical lanes of traffic is absurd.\nFirstly, Bloor Street (and Yonge St) are both \u201csubway lines\u201d.  In addition to removing 2 lanes of traffic, thus making it challenging and difficult for emergency vehicles to get through\u2026 when there\u2019s a subway closure (and let\u2019s face reality\u2026 the TTC is broken). The amount of times the subway is down, and shuttle buses are required to replace a failing transit system, creates even more gridlock.\nThe second issue is the design of the bike lanes (including barriers, painted streets, etc)\nThe design has created blind spots for drivers who need  to make a simple right hand turn off of Bloor Street to any side street.  The cyclists (both sport riders & commuters), and the delivery persons on scooters or e-bikes (which btw can go up to speeds of 35-40km/hr - often faster than a car travelling along Bloor) are both zipping along Bloor St, and it\u2019s extremely difficult to see them coming behind you due to this poor design.\nThe city complains about the cost of installing and dismantling the bike lanes - both amounts seem outrageously inflated!! - yet, they continue to install bike traffic lights along Bloor Street West (Runnymede / Windermere) as recent as last week!!  I\u2019m sure they\u2019re going to say \u201cit was already in the works\u201d, yet we all know that these projects can be cancelled and funds repurposed towards other priorities like repairing our streets, helping the homeless, trying to keep the cost of living under control, etc\nWe need to have these bike lanes shifted to side streets, and alternate them every other street (one bike lane per street), so not to create congestion everywhere, and allow for the same amount of parking for residents.\nAs a resident of Bloor West village, I can hear and see how divisive this topic has become (especially around the city\u2019s latest project of installing bike lanes along Parkside Dr. I think any sane person can see how crazy this idea is.\nI hope our Premier and provincial government can help step in to prevent any further bike lanes from creating even more gridlock; and removing bikes lanes along Bloor St West, Yonge St and Hospital Row (University Ave)\n"
