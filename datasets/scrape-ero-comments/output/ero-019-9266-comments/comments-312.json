        "comment": "The provincial government should not be intervening in municipal affairs. Especially after municipalities have detailed studies before implementing things like bike lanes, detailing all of the added benefits.\nIt is a well known fact that having more bicycles on the road improves the capacity of traveller's on our streets, while taking up less volume, and would eliminate the need for more cars to be on the road in the first place.\nThis proposal is fundamentally flawed in its approach as it does not recognize bikers as commuters.\nPromoting these bike lanes, instead of removing or relocating them is a crucial mistake that will only make congestion worse as time passes.\nI urge this government to reconsider and abandon this bill.\n"

        "comment": "Why are you doubling down on your bad decisions here? An amendment detailing the removal of specific lanes in Toronto when no review of them has been done by the province as was originally proposed would happen - really? A removal that contradicts all existing evidence (data, studies, pilots, community consultations, expert opinions, environmental improvement plans, etc) which all tell the opposite story of what you are assuming they do.\nBike lanes IMPROVE traffic and make roads safer for ALL users! You can't ignore the facts.\nKeep Bloor/Danforth, Yonge & University bike lanes in Toronto. Keep other existing bike lanes across cities in Ontario. Allow municipalities to make decisions to build MORE bike lanes.\nAlso, use an environmental scan before you build things like highways! Don't sneak in lines within other legislations to circumvent useful protocols/process like an environmental scan before building something that might ruin the environment and wildlife in Ontario! Prove it is safe to build it, follow processes in place, consult Ontarians, then build it if it makes sense to do so!\n"

        "comment": "The update that requires removal of existing bloor, Yonge and university lanes makes this so much worse. Those are some of the safest areas of the city to ride, and encourage many people to ride, where they would have taken a car instead. Removing that safety encourages those people back into cars. Picture every cyclist you see, in a car instead, and imagine the increase in grid lock. Putting people on bikes, takes cars off the street and makes traffic lighter.\nThis bill has no basis in reality, is ill-defined for its own intended purpose and should be entirely scrapped.\n"

        "comment": "\"In alignment with these objectives, Ontario is looking to fight gridlock and get drivers where they need to go faster. Prescribed municipalities would be required to seek provincial approval to allow for the implementation of new bicycle lanes (\u201cbike lanes\u201d) that require the removal of an existing lane of traffic.\"\nHello! It feels highly inappropriate that the Government of Ontario is making a conclusion that the removal of bike lanes will have any impact in \"fighting gridlock and getting drivers where they need to go faster\" without doing any sort of evidence-based due diligence.\nStudy after study shows that multimodal transportation improves road traffic (by getting people off the road); adding hundreds of thousands of additional car trips from folks no longer able to bike to work doesn't reduce the number of cars.\nEven beyond the incorrect conclusion that removing travel options will speed up cars, a broader question is to be made as to why taxpayers that drive cars are being prioritized over those that don't, or can't.\n"

We should be encouraging more use of public transit and bikes instead of cars.\nAs a cyclist myself, I will feel much more unsafe biking on those busy roads if the bike lanes are removed. If they are removed, I will be taking up an entire lane of traffic, going the same speed as I was in a bike lane (or slower because of traffic) which will actually make traffic worse compared to if I was on a separated bike lane.\nThis decision seems to lack common sense and has no regard for the safety of bicyclists. This should also be a municipal issue, and not a provincial issue.\n"

        "comment": "I live in Etobicoke close to the Bloor bike lanes.  I use them often, and would like for my children and the children of others in our area to use them to safely get around.  This legislation ignores the mandate given to Toronto's mayor and city council, who were elected in a platform of bike lanes.  It ignores the petitions of UofT on safety, the annex BIA on the lanes helping their business, and frankly any evidence based approach to fighting gridlock and increasing safety.  The lives of our children should not be a tool the government uses to buy votes from wealthy donors and people who don't live in our neighborhoods.  This bill is shameful.\n"

        "comment": "I am enormously upset to hear about the Ford government's plan to rip out major bike lanes in Toronto and prevent many future bike lanes.\nFirst of all, there is NO evidence provided that these bike lanes create gridlock. In fact, by making it safer to bike in Toronto, bike lanes take cars off the road and help reduce gridlock.\nSecondly, bike lanes make it much safer for riders to get around the city, and encourage more people to commute this way.  This is good for the city. And it is good for cyclists and public health, because it is healthier than driving all the time.\nThirdly, getting people on bicycles is important for reducing climate change, and must be considered as part of the larger strategy.\nFourthly, why is this even the province's business?  The City of Toronto has the staff, the know-how and expertise to determine the best transportation options.  This is clearly overreach by the province.\nI feel extremely strongly about this issue and am willing to get politically involved to stop it from happening.  It is a backwards move and we need to be going forward.\n"

Bike rider concentrations are high in denser parts of the city and are highly utilized. Opening those areas for cars will not reduce gridlock, the volume of cars is simply too high, with too many stoplights.\nFurther, the provicial government is overreaching by getting involved in minor Municipal matters like bike lanes.

In 2023, that shot up to 5.7 million trips.\"\nhttps://www.cbc.ca/news/science/bike-lanes-impacts-1.7358319\nIn terms of the environment this is significantly reducing both grid lock and reducing emissions from using vehicles. There is a direct correlation with improving bike infrastructure and increase biking.\n\"That\u2019s because cycling has a carbon footprint of just 33 grams of CO2 per mile traveled. That\u2019s up to 30 times lower than that of a fossil fuel car, and even less than that of walking or taking public transportation. \"\n.\nIf we're serious about the environment and reducing gridlock this is no data to show this helping overall. Anyone driving those streets at rush hour can see there are other points causing the congestion (ie. People trying to get onto the Gardiner). If we're serious about improving congestion and the environment we would find ways to get people out of cars and onto other modes of transportation.\n"

This also completely ignores the EA process that took place prior to it's construction. Its a total waste of money to rip up newly constructed infrastructure because some people are abusing their new powers. Finally, this is a municipal road and should be designed and run as seen fit by the rightfully elected municipal council. Why should someone in Thunder Bay, London or Ottawa get a say on how Toronto develops specific roads. Stop micromanaging municipalities and focus on important provincial issues like healthcare.\n"
