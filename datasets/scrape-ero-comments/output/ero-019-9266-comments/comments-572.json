        "comment": "Bike lanes save lives, reduce congestion, and improve the quality of life of Torontonians.\nThis proposal is absurd. The city has invested $27 million in building this infrastructure which keeps traffic off the road and keeps cyclists safe. The cost to remove this infrastructure is $49 million. This proposal is an insult to tax payers.\nThe Premier of this Province needs to keep his filthy paws out of our city centre. This is a municipal issue that falls under the city's jurisdiction.\nLess than a third of my electoral riding uses cars as their primary mode of transportation. The majority of people use public transport, cycling, ride sharing or walking. These transport options are better for our health and our planet.\nDestroying infrastructure to support alternative modes of transportation is idiotic, so it's not surprising this is the brain child of our Premiere. But it is surprising that the Premiere thinks we will not fight tooth-and-nail to protect our infrastructure, and to keep his bad policy and bad intentions out of our city.\nThe Premiere thinks we want bike lanes out of city. But what we want out is him.\n"

        "comment": "Research shows that bike lanes reduce gridlock. Policy and legislative initiatives can incentivize behavior and this bill will encourage people to drive their cars. This will, in turn, cause more congestion and loss of productivity. Bike lanes provide a safe, healthy and environmentally friendly option to allow people to move through the city. In short, bike lanes are the solution, not the problem. Please do not remove the bike lanes on Bloor Street, Yonge Street and University Avenue. The City of Toronto invested a great deal  of thought, effort and financial resources in constructing these bike lanes. These bike lanes were installed after much careful consideration and research. These bike lanes are used quite heavily (I know because I use them daily) and tearing them out would be wasteful, dangerous and counter-productive.\nThank you for providing me an opportunity to offer my opinion!\n"

        "comment": "As someone who has been commuting by bike since I was in elementary school, the proposal to remove cycling infrastructure comes at a great disappointment. With 2024 having the highest cyclist death toll, is now really the time to be proposing to remove infrastructure that keeps cyclists safe? As a new driver, I am also in support of improving bike infrastructure around the city because having cyclists in the same lane as cars feels like it slows down traffic a lot more than having cyclists in their own separate lane. I think that this proposal prioritizes convenience for drivers over the safety and well-being of cyclists and I believe that safer streets and neighbourhoods can only be a net positive for everyone.\n"

        "comment": "The provincial government should avoid adding red tape that hinders local efforts to improve transportation options. Bike lanes are essential infrastructure, similar to sidewalks, that I rely on daily. They ensure safety for vulnerable road users and provide a dedicated space for cyclists, which reduces conflict with drivers. Bike lanes also enhance transit access by making it easier to reach stations. Preserving them supports a balanced approach to transportation, prioritizing both accessibility and safety over vehicle capacity alone.\n"

        "comment": "The provincial government\u2019s intervention in city infrastructure decisions, like bike lanes, is a clear overreach that undermines the very purpose of municipal governance. We elect city councils to represent our specific needs, and they are best positioned to make these decisions. Imposing costly mandates from the provincial level wastes taxpayer money and disregards local communities' priorities. Spending $48 million to remove established bike lanes\u2014without even accounting for the cost of installing them elsewhere\u2014is an irresponsible use of public funds and dismisses the growing need for sustainable, accessible transportation options.\nBike share Toronto usage has grown exponentially and the availability of safe, separated bike lanes is a major factor in that. The removal of bike lanes is not going to stop people from biking, especially at a time when cost of living is extremely high.\nIf the goal is genuinely to alleviate congestion, there are far more effective, cost-efficient ways to do it: improving public transit by investing in dedicated bus lanes and bus rapid transit, for instance, would provide immediate, broad-reaching benefits. Let the people who actually live in these cities decide how they want to grow. Provincial leaders should focus on enabling municipalities to address their unique transportation needs\u2014not dictating costly, disruptive changes that ignore the community\u2019s voice.\n"

They also provide safety for my five-year-old who regularly uses them on the weekend to get around the city. Removing these lanes would put my entire family in more danger. If it is no longer safe, then I will be forced to drive my car and add an additional vehicle to the radio horrific congestion on Toronto\u2019s roads. Highly recommend you revisit this proposal.\n"

        "comment": "The removal of the bike lanes in Toronto is a ridiculous idea particularly since it seems to be driven by a man who selfishly only wants it done because it \u201c interferes\u201d with his commute home. Since the installation of them, I have seen the increased use of them in vital commuting corridors as cyclists finally have a safe place to ride. The feeling of security they give to cyclists being separated from traffic is immeasurable. It is unfortunate that Doug Ford can only see things through his own lens as he is meant to be governing for the whole. As a taxpayer, the waste of money on un-installing them is absurd. If we can afford to spend $48 million on undoing something that does good, why can\u2019t we re-direct that money to say, foodbanks, healthcare raises for family doctors so people can get a g.p., pay increases for nurses so people will want to go into the profession, public housing, mental health supports, addiction support, transit infrastructure, you name it. What a waste of time and money! Please do not remove the bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "I think this proposal is a waste of money that won't actually solve gridlock. Gridlock is caused by poor driving not bike lanes or cyclists. Gridlock is caused when drivers drive into the intersection when there isn't space on the other side for them to fit. The light changes and suddenly they block the intersection. There's gridlock on three lane roads (HWY 7 in Markham) so increasing the number of lanes is not the solution. Driver education and reducing the number of cars downtown would be the solution the traffic and gridlock.\nRemoving additional lanes for years to be under construction also doesn't help reduce traffic or gridlock. Example being Yonge and Eglinton.\nRemoving bike lanes is also bad for all the university students who use them to get around. This would be the major population you are affecting because this is a huge part of the downtown population that needs multiple transit options because they can't afford cars. The buses get stuck in the same traffic as cars so many choose to cycle as an alternative. But to do that, many students would want to be in dedicated bike lanes because that provides separation and safety from the car traffic.\nThe province has separate responsibilities from the municipal government and I think this proposal encroaches on the city's territory. If the citizens of Toronto democratically elected a Mayor who supports these bike lanes, then the province shouldn't interfere. If the province focused on larger scale infrastructure, such a giving the northern Richmond Hill GO line dedicated track so it can run more than just commuter hours, then we can reduce congestion by reducing cars.\nThe transportation ministers talks about putting bike lanes \"where they make sense\" however I think they have never ridden a bike in the city before. Where it makes sense to add a bike lane is a place where people want to bike and it's too dangerous to. I don't think the lives of the people who have died while cycling in the city is worth the time taken away from drivers stuck in traffic, especially because when they are solely responsible for gridlock. We should be focused on the MOBILITY OF PEOPLE NOT CARS. You need to build bike lanes in places people want to go and they need to be maintained so that people want to use it. The reason people in Toronto don't bike in the winter is because the bike lanes are never plowed, therefore they don't bike because it is unsafe. If safe Infrastructure is provided, then people will use it. So I think the statistics the transportation ministers cites as a reason to remove the bike lanes is completely invalid because it doesn't take these matters into account.\nIn conclusion, this proposal doesn't actually reduce congestion or gridlock because gridlock is caused by poor driving and not cyclists. Removing them will result in more casualties of cyclists. I also don't believe the province should have control over municipal streets when the people of Toronto elected a local government that supports the bike lanes. This proposal is a waste of tax payer money that could be used better elsewhere.\n"

        "comment": "I live near Bloor St and Jane and do not find the  bike lanes contribute to gridlock. There are certainly traffic frustrations but it seems largely attributed to construction in the area with large condos going in and lane restrictions there and increasing traffic coming down Jane to get to the highway from the north end. The bike lanes provide safe transit options for the area and given the influx of condos along this route - are a viable option for those living and working in the city. High park is also trying to increase the walkability of the park and so the bike lanes allow for another mode of access to the park. These bike lanes, in addition to a viable transit option, provide safety for cyclists and reassurance for those of us driving that there is less likelihood that we may hit, \u201cdoor\u201d or injure a cyclist.\nThe plans noted here indicate the solution lies in adding more highways. This will increase travel through the city arteries as folks try to get to the highways (see studies quoted in attached article). A viable future forward vision to reduce congestion, rather than redirect and increase volume, would be to provide more regular and reliable transit options and alternates such as cycling in the city. Increasing rail options and schedules on GO, VIA rail and UPS would provide direct routes to the city for those in suburbs and areas outside the GTA area - making it more convenient and economical than driving - people need incentive, convenience and viable alternatives to driving into the city. Studies show that if travel is convenient and reliable - people will use it. Simply increasing roads and reasons to drive will increase drivers, cars, congestion and pollution. Transit and greater commuter options would make travel to and within the city more affordable to the people of Ontario and reduce pollution. More roads = more cars. We need to stop doing the same old thing (more lanes more highways) as the congestion has only gotten worse.\nRedirecting the cost of removing these lanes to an investment in provincial commuter services would be a much more valuable long term investment in our future. If trains to Hamilton, Niagara, Brampton, KW increased in offerings and were direct routes regularly - more people would use them regularly as it would be the most affordable and viable option.\n"

        "comment": "**Opposition to the Removal of Bike Lanes under Bill 212**\nI am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed removal of bike lanes on Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue as outlined in Bill 212. These bike lanes are vital infrastructure that benefit all road users and play a critical role in making Toronto\u2019s streets safer, more accessible, and more sustainable.\nFirstly, bike lanes save lives. Dedicated cycling infrastructure reduces collisions and fatalities by separating cyclists from motor vehicles. Toronto has seen too many tragic accidents, and removing these lanes would put more lives at risk. According to the City of Toronto\u2019s own reports, streets with bike lanes experience significantly fewer serious injuries and deaths.\nIn addition to safety, bike lanes support local businesses. Studies conducted along the Bloor Street bike lane show that retail sales increased after the lanes were installed. Cyclists are more likely to stop and shop at local businesses compared to drivers, and removing these lanes will hurt the economic vitality of these neighbourhoods.\nFurthermore, bike lanes are an essential tool in reducing traffic congestion. One less car on the road reduces gridlock for everyone. Encouraging active transportation through safe cycling infrastructure is a proven way to ease congestion and promote more efficient use of road space. Removing bike lanes will only increase car dependency and worsen gridlock, contradicting the bill\u2019s stated goal of improving mobility.\nLastly, bike lanes provide an affordable, accessible transportation option for those who cannot afford the high costs of vehicle ownership. By removing this infrastructure, the government is limiting equitable access to transportation and disproportionately harming low-income individuals who rely on cycling as a primary means of travel.\nI urge you to reconsider this damaging proposal. Removing bike lanes is not just a step backward for Toronto but a move that undermines the safety, economy, and livability of our city. Ontario should be expanding its cycling infrastructure, not dismantling it.\nSincerely,\nToronto St. Paul\u2019s resident\n"

        "comment": "Removal of bike lanes does not ease congestion. We know this.\nSetting aside the countless economic, social, and environmental benefits of cycling and reduced vehicle miles traveled, bikes take up less space on the road, and bike lanes enable more people of all comfort levels to cycle safely, reducing the number of cars on the road. Reducing the number of cars on the road (and in particular, single-occupant vehicles), is the only way to reduce congestion. Adding more car lanes to our roads only attracts more drivers, and increases the vehicle miles traveled, exacerbating congestion and traffic. Decades of research have proven this, and if the Ontario government wanted to address the issue of congestion as they say they do, they would be looking at the facts and trying to figure out how to improve conditions for alternative modes of transportation including cycling, walking, and transit. Wasting public funds in reversing well-planned infrastructure would be disastrous to Ontarian's quality of life not to mention the reputation of our world-class cities.\n"

If you look at the best cities in the world, all of them have great bike infrastructure.

A full 68 per cent of those collisions took place on streets without cycling infrastructure.\nThe report also refers to a study from Toronto Metropolitan University, which looked at cyclist-vehicle collisions before and after the city installed fully separated bike lanes between 2000 and 2016. That study found there were 2.57 times more people cycling on city streets and a 35 per cent drop in collision rates in surrounding areas after bike lanes were installed.\u201d\n\u201c Saxe believes Ford\u2019s plan to rip up bike lanes will not only make streets more congested, it will also make cycling less safe for those who choose to bike.\n\u201cLiterally, people will die,\u201d she says. \u201cBusinesses will make less money; air quality will be worse and the city will be more congested.\u201d\nSaxe says there is a \u201cif you build it, they will come\u201d factor when it comes to bike lanes.\n\u201cThere are lots of people waiting for a choice to get out of their cars and many don't have it yet,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd that's exactly the opposite of what the province is doing.

Having bike lanes seperate from main roads with dividers increases safety for both the person in the vehicle and the rider, as it forces people to drive slower and bikes don't have to ride next to cars. Biking also provides a cheap alternative to driving. Poorer Canadians can't always afford to get a car, and removing a way to commute to work will make it even harder to aquire wealth. Public transit isn't always a viable option, as buses can get stuck in the same traffic as the rest of vehicles on the road.\n"
