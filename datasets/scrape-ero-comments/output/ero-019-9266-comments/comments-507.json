        "comment": "As a primary user of Toronto downtown bicycle infrastructure from 2019-2022 I can say it allowed for me to start my career and afford to live in the city.\nI saw no possible alternative to live in this city if it wasn't for the dedicated bike lanes on Bloor, University, and Addelaide/Richmond (when they aren't under construction).\nI absent of a city planning degree can only speak personally about the necessity of dedicated lanes on arterial roads. Drawing on the eastern portion of Lakeshore bike trail, it is impractical and time-prohibitive to rely on residential routes as a primary route for commuters. The same conclusions can be drawn in the inner-city, with little to no option of a direct corridor on residential streets that span multiple areas in the inner city. Requirements change based on postal codes, regardless of city, and effective planning must consider integrating a bike network holistically.\nA case for reviewing proposed and fully implemented bike lanes should be had. It is however important to view primary commuters as those not only using bike lanes as a work commute; but rather those using it for their livelihoods and personal pleasure.\nAs a resident of another metropolitan center in the province, I worry about the current Governments plans to scrap Toronto's bike network still in it's infancy and with portions under scrutiny not yet completed. I will continue to use the bike network in my city for my work and personal commutes. And should plans for continued disinvestment in bike infrastructure continue, I have see no issue using the extended pedestrian walkways.. as there is no pedestrians using them (they're all in cars)\n"

        "comment": "As a resident of Toronto, I do NOT want to removal of bike lanes from the identified roadways. Cyclists use these major arteries to commute to work as well as motorists, and they have the right to commute in a safe way. Removal of those bike lanes will only endanger existing cyclists and they will not reduce the congestion your bill claims it will do. It's only when we DON'T ask commuters to rely solely on their cars that we'll see a reduction in congestion. I don't believe this bill has been put forward with the interests of all Toronto commuters in mind, and the provincial government would spend it's time better investing resources in improving and delivering mass transit plans that can reliably and efficiently move large groups of commuters, like the woefully delayed Eglinton Crosstown light rail.\n"

        "comment": "Time and time again roads are expanded to ease congestion and the results are always the same. A short period where commute times are shorter then they quickly return to pre-expansion times if not longer. This lowly citizen might humbly suggest that there is a pattern here and we should look for an actual solution instead of mindlessly walking into the exact same trap over and over again.\nOther countries have already solved this problem, we don't even need to figure out the solution for ourselves. Expanding bike lane coverage to cover more of their home cities, more investment into public transport, rezoning residential neighborhoods to reduce total travel distances. These things have worked in other countries and cities, why wouldn't they work here? Do you believe Canadians are so stupid as to be unable to take a bus or ride a bike? Or are you simply too lazy to do proper research on how to fix traffic?\nPeople always talk about how lovely European cities are, how wonderful Japan and Korea are to visit, so why aren't we trying to make our cities more like the ones which we admire so much? Why are we making our cities less walkable, more noisy and more gray? It this really the type of city we want?\n"

I hope this bill does not go through.\n"

        "comment": "I am a resident of Toronto who uses the bike lanes downtown every day, not only to go to work but also to attend classes, visit family and friends, run errands, and for recreational purposes. I want to reject this bill since it indiscriminately eliminates bike lanes, an essential piece of the traffic infrastructure, key for road safety as well as for traffic solutions, for the local economy, and for the health and wellbeing of the inhabitants.\nBike lanes play a vital role in ensuring road safety by keeping cyclists separate from cars, which drastically reduces accidents. Cities with dedicated bike lanes report fewer collisions and fatalities, as these lanes help both cyclists and drivers navigate more safely. Removing them will push cyclists into car-dense streets, making accidents more likely and putting more people at risk.\nFor traffic management, bike lanes are a proven way to alleviate congestion. In major cities, encouraging cycling over driving reduces traffic volume, making travel smoother and faster for everyone. Cutting bike lanes would only increase car dependency, leading to more gridlock on Toronto\u2019s already busy roads.\nEconomically, bike lanes benefit local businesses, as cyclists are more likely to stop at shops and restaurants than car commuters. Studies show that bike-friendly areas experience higher customer traffic for small businesses, a critical factor in supporting local economies. Removing bike lanes risks losing this benefit and slowing down urban economic growth.\nAdditionally, the 1.2% bike ridership figure cited by the provincial government misrepresents this urban area, where cycling is a primary means of transport for many, not only for commuting but also for any other purpose, even biking as a form of work, as delivery drivers do. This data is skewed with areas of poor cycling infrastructure and doesn\u2019t reflect the true importance of bike lanes in the city.\nThese are the bike lanes that currently allow me and many others to navigate the city safely. Removing them disregards our right to safe, accessible transportation and will increase congestion, accidents, and pollution. I strongly urge you to reconsider and reject this bill in the interest of a safer, healthier, and more sustainable Ontario.\n"

        "comment": "I am greatly concerned about the removal of existing bike lanes in Toronto. I am a four season cyclist who commutes from the High Park area to the University of Toronto. The Bloor bike lanes have made a huge difference in how safe my commute is. Also, I will note that data shows that accidents for cyclists, pedestrians and motorists along the Bloor corridor have been reduced significantly after the introduction of these bike lanes. Data from the Annex area also clearly shows that the economic impact of the bike lanes is not negative.\nIt is understandable that there is opposition to the more recently installed sections of the bike lanes. It takes time for public opinion to change. Tearing out the bike lanes west of Runnymede would be highly premature.\nFinally, everyone acknowledges that traffic congestion continues to get worse in Toronto. However, there are many causes other than bike lanes that contribute. Highest among these is the densification all across the city, leading to more cars on the road. This is unsustainable.  Along Bloor, given the planned developments in the six points area, it is not possible to accommodate all of the new commuters if they choose to drive. The city and the province have to give people alternatives to driving. Bike lanes are part of the solution, as is upgraded public transit.\n"

        "comment": "Biking is the fastest way to get around the Toronto core by at least 25% in all cases. I know, I've been timing and comparing it to other methods for a decade. Cars are never faster unless it's past 10pm, and trains go about the same speed with stops. Only if you need to cross the majority of the width of the TTC is using it faster than biking. When it comes to street cars, running is actually just as fast as using them. Bikes are provably the best way to move people of all incomes, it's classist to do otherwise.\n"

They get in my way, cause traffic accidents, drive unsafely, honk their horns, everything.\nIf you get rid of bike lanes, you'll be pushing more people to drive. This will make my commute and day to day worse.\nI want as many people as possible to take any other way (bike, bus, walk, I don't care) so I don't have to deal with them on the road.\nI only drive in one lane at a time. That's all I need. If you give me a choice between three lanes full of traffic or one lane with hardly any traffic, I'll take the one lane every time.\nI want more bike lanes, less cars, so I can enjoy driving.\n"

        "comment": "The provincial government shouldn't be adding red tape and bureaucracy to slow down local governments trying to increase transportation options. Bike lanes are essential transportation infrastructure like sidewalks. We need to think about guaranteeing safety and providing options for vulnerable road users instead of just maximizing the number of cars on the road. When I drive I would much rather cyclists be out of my way in their own bike lanes. Bike lanes support transit investments by making it easier to get to stations.\n"

        "comment": "The proposal to remove bike lanes on Bloor, Yonge, and University is concerning. Bike lanes provide a safe, efficient, and environmentally friendly way to commute, reducing the need to rely on cars or, for many, the TTC, which has become increasingly unsafe. By removing bike lanes, Ontario risks limiting viable transit options for people who depend on cycling as an alternative.\nThe bill\u2019s goal to ease gridlock is understandable, but removing bike lanes could backfire, pushing more people onto already crowded roads or back to the TTC, further burdening an already strained and, at times, unsafe transit system. Many cities worldwide are expanding, not shrinking, their bike networks, recognizing that active transportation supports traffic flow, urban safety, and environmental goals. Ontario should view cycling infrastructure as a valuable part of its overall transportation solution, balancing road access for all users rather than prioritizing cars alone.\n"

        "comment": "This is a very bad and backward proposed Act, from the perspective of a car driver and from the perspective of GOVERNANCE. I also note that no links are provided to any studies or evidence that support the proposal.\n\u2014 First of all, LEAVE TOWNS and CITIES to make their own decisions. The province has no business butting in, uninvited, to areas of town/city/municipal jurisdiction (the province sure doesn\u2019t like it when it perceives that the federal government it trying to involve itself in provincial areas of responsibility).\n\u2014 You are unnecessarily INCREASING BUREAUCRATIC PROCESSES and taking TAXPAYERS\u2019 MONEY by creating new processes. Towns and cities which are already apparently struggling financially would have to use resources to apply to the province's new requirements, or they would have to use their resources when compelled by the province to send it information [seriously?] and the province will also have to dedicate new resources to set up its new policies and review process. What a WASTE OF MONEY.\n\u2014 This will SLOW car/truck traffic! Reducing dedicated bicycle lanes in towns and cities will push bicycles INTO car lanes. In my experience, a bicyclist without a dedicated lane must take the middle of the lane to avoid being \u201ccar-doored\u201d and to prevent some drivers (most are very considerate) making dangerous passes (which usually just gets them to the next red light a little faster).\n\u2014 This will also SLOW car/truck traffic because it may INCREASE the use of cars. Dedicated and safe bicycle lanes increase the use of bicycles for transportation and reduce the number of people in cars.\n\u2014 This may INCREASE hospital care costs and demands on hospitals due to increased bicycle - car/truck collisions.\n"

        "comment": "I understand the frustration around traffic, but strongly support bike lanes on major roads.\nAs an Etobicoke resident and downtown business owner I use the Bloor and University bike lanes on a regular basis to commute to work. They improve safety for cyclists and other device users, keeping them  away from cars and pedestrians alike.\nI have felt the increase of traffic in my community but see the growth and densification happening and know that cars are not scalable transportation. Specifically with Etobicoke our community is at a massive change that will see more families and greater density that the planning and solutions for include more transportation options including cycling.\nRemoving bike lanes across the city now would be similar to the cancellation of the Eglinton subway in 1995. All reports and studies clearly showed the benefits and need of more transportation options that the Eglinton line would have created. The same is true of bike lanes. The project was re-imagined later at greater pain and expense to the city, with still no launch date or relief for residents in site.\nPlease don't make the same mistake with bike lanes.\n"

Cyclists will still bike\u2014often out of necessity because they're a far more economic option\u2014and these cyclists will be in more danger when sharing lanes with cars. And drivers won't be happier either with more cyclists taking up space in \"their\" lanes.\nCars are one of the most space-inefficient and expensive ways for people to move around a busy city like Toronto, and making more space for them is simply not the answer to gridlock.\nImagine if even a third of those 125,000 new Torontonians from 2022\u20132023 bought their own car into Toronto...the lane space gained by removing dedicated bike lanes would do nothing to reduce that massive increase in car traffic.\n"
