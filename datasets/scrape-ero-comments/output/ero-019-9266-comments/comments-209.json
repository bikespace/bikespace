I choose to use the bike lanes almost every day, it's a far more efficient way of getting around the city than my car. If we want to alleviate pressure on drivers let's improve the last mile transit options.\nWhy the province is getting involved in the city's decision is beyond me and smacks of unnecessary overreach.\n"

        "comment": "This bill undermines effective urban planning and road safety. Bike lanes play a critical role in reducing traffic congestion by keeping cyclists separated from motor vehicle lanes, which improves traffic flow and road safety for everyone.\nImposing provincial oversight discourages the development of this essential infrastructure, potentially leading to increased conflicts between cyclists and motorists, ultimately worsening congestion and contradicting the stated goal of reducing gridlock.\nMoreover, this bill introduces unnecessary regulatory hurdles that conflict with core Conservative values. By adding layers of approval and oversight, the bill increases bureaucracy and restricts municipalities\u2019 ability to make timely, localized decisions about infrastructure. This contradicts the principles of reducing regulatory barriers and promoting efficient governance.\nI urge you to reconsider this bill, as it poses significant risks to traffic management while adding unnecessary red tape that stifles municipal autonomy and progress. Thank you for considering my perspective.\n"

        "comment": "I am strongly opposed to Bill 212 (ERO #019-9266). As our cities grow we need more sustainable ways of transportation and bike lanes should be a significant part of that. In 2023 the Ontario Ministry of Transportation released their annual report which found that cars killed 616 people in Ontario alone and injured 36,090. In addition to their immediate harm to Ontario citizens, a report by Transport Canada shows that in 2021 over half of emission from transportation comes from passenger vehicles which led to more than 15,300 premature deaths form air pollution. Given how dangerous cars are we need less of them on our streets, not more and the easiest way to achieve this is by allowing cities to install bikes lanes where they see fit to promote other forms of transportation. For this reason, I believe Bill 212 (ERO #019-9266) is an overreach by the provincial government which will result in countless deaths which should not be taken lightly.\n"

        "comment": "As a commuter to Toronto from Mississauga, and an individual who is concerned about climate change and the impacts it will and is already causing, this bill to ban bike lanes, and even remove some from arterial streets in the city is appalling. Not only does it show a misunderstanding of how traffic and congestion is made, but a clear lack of understanding of the wants and needs of Toronto and GTA residents.\nLess bike lanes does not help with congestion, providing people with other means to get where they are going does. More transit options, such as bikes and trains will actively reduce congestion for vehicles that need it.\nDestroying successful public infrastructure, such as safe bike lanes, is an awful idea and the government should reverse course immediately.\n"

I bike almost everyday, including in the winter, with my family (3 small kids) as does my partner. I know at least 5 families that do the same. I cross the city daily from Danforth and Donlands to 20 Bay Street and back. I go to most of our family activities in the city by bike. If I take the train, I take a bike to the train station. Please don't remove the bike lanes that make this a safer activity for us. Please don't make us loop around to find safe roads and bike lanes. Cyclists need direct routes that are protected/safe to make cycling feasible. It is not a hobby for many and is a way of commuting.\nBike lanes keep many people out of ubers, cars and transit. The more high quality, protected bike lanes we have, the more people will cycle to help with congestion. Otherwise, you will definitely have more people in Ubers and cars to add to congestion on the road, and more cars parked on the road, which will defeat the purpose of removing bike lanes since these lanes will still be blocked by parked cars.\n"

        "comment": "The autonomy of municipalities in deciding when and how to introduce bike lanes is crucial for fostering safer, more efficient urban environments. Seeking approval from provincial authorities will delay the implementation of these life-saving measures, wasting valuable resources and time. Cyclists face significant risks on the roads, with injuries and fatalities climbing, the need for dedicated bike lanes becomes even more pressing. Research consistently demonstrates that bike lanes do not contribute to traffic congestion; in fact, they can enhance the flow of vehicles and promote healthier, more sustainable modes of transportation. Moreover, removing existing bike lanes would not only endanger cyclists but also squander taxpayer money that has already been invested in these infrastructures. By empowering municipalities to make timely decisions about bike lanes, cities can ensure safer, more accessible mobility for all residents.\n"

        "comment": "This proposition is critically flawed:\n1. Municipal traffic is the concern of the municipalities: bike lanes do not exist on highways and thus do not impact \"provincial\" (i.e. inter-city) travel, with perhaps very few exceptions; any perceived congestion impacts residents of the municipality almost exclusively; this makes as much sense as requiring provincial approval for repairing potholes or amending hours of a public swimming pool.\n2. There appears to be no evidence/data to support the potential removal of existing cycling infrastructure, specifically projections regarding future increase/decrease of cyclists in municipal areas; as cities (and provinces!) purport to be reducing congestion and improving, among other things, air quality, data would be helpful in motivating any prospective infrastructure changes.\n3. Persons who cycle out of necessity (e.g. commuters) fall into one of two categories: car owners who choose to cycle, and non-car owners for whom cycling is the best/only option. The former, if disincentivized from using bike lanes, will instead drive cars, which will -- it is unbelievable that this needs emphasizing -- generate more automobile traffic. The latter category will be forced to cycle on roads without cycling infrastructure, which can only further slow down automobile traffic and risk of accident.\n4. For a government that purportedly prides itself on \"red tape reduction,\" it seems at best antithetical and at worst petty and vindictive to add a layer of provincial bureaucracy to what is, again, a fundamentally municipal matter.\nAddendum: perhaps a viable alternative would be for the province to spearhead, and fund, construction of underground tunnels for cyclists in municipal areas.\n"

        "comment": "The stated, abstract objective of this Act is to reduce \u201cgridlock,\u201d using means which are proven to be detrimental to public health and safety, mobility and access to Ontario communities for all people, environmental protection, and will aid in worsening the ongoing climate emergency.\nDespite having the authority to do so per the Municipal Act, requiring provincial approval for construction of new bike lanes where they \u201creplace a lane of traffic\u201d is a dramatic overreach of government authority in the affairs of municipalities. This is meddlesome and suggests the provincial government doesn\u2019t have faith or trust in municipalities to manage their own affairs, and further suggests that the provincial government isn\u2019t interested in local democracy\u2014bike lanes aren\u2019t constructed without warning; they are built only after an extensive planning process, which includes considerable research and community input.\nFurthermore, it is an objective fact that more car lanes will not reduce traffic congestion: the concept of Induced Demand indicates that with more car lanes, there is more traffic. This phenomenon has been observed all over the world. If this government were serious about \u201creducing gridlock,\u201d it would be making investments to the tune of several billion dollars to prioritize development and construction of extensive transit projects all over the province, and would invest considerable time, money and effort into the construction of more, comprehensive cycling networks. One more bike on the road is one less car; bikes take up far less space on the road than a single occupancy vehicle, thereby making more room for those who are or who must drive.\nIt is important to mention as well that the three bike lanes Premier Ford has pledged to remove in Toronto also see thousands of users per day\u2014that\u2019s literally thousands of cars that are off the road as a result. Local businesses are more successful in areas with bike lanes (this is easily proven looking at the Bloor Bike Lane reports prepared by City staff in Toronto), and various Toronto BIAs have already come out in support of bike lanes and the detrimental impact their removal would have on local businesses.\nCycling is also the far healthier option: physical activity leads to better health outcomes which leads to less money required for healthcare services.\nInstallation of bike lanes also have the added advantage of making the entire streetscape safer to use for all mobility modes; cars, bikes, pedestrians, and all others. Their existence can save the lives of cyclists and many others. Six cyclists have died on Toronto streets this year, and that is six too many; innocent lives lost because the victims were trying to get across town. Utterly senseless, with families shattered as a result.\nPertaining to bike lanes, my final comment is that the existence of these lanes gives all people greater access to their municipality. Those without the financial means to own a car, pay for insurance, parking, gas, etc. are more able to traverse their municipality for work, recreation, and to support the local economy. A car-centric community is a community that closes itself off to a considerable portion of its population.\nOn the topic of exempting 413 lands from environmental assessments, this is yet another short-sighted policy that will result in disastrous outcomes for the environment. The area where the highway is intended to be built is environmentally sensitive land. Once paved over, that land is lost as a carbon sink, a natural habitat for native flora and fauna, and as a floodplain/natural flood control measure\u2014forever. The proposal that this highway should be exempted from any environmental assessment to expedite development suggests the government doesn\u2019t care whatsoever about the environment and, again, is not serious about eliminating gridlock: as mentioned above, the concept of induced demand means that on completion, it will create more gridlock and spew more harmful greenhouses gas emissions into the atmosphere. Here, again, I must emphasize that if the government is serious about reducing gridlock, the only way forward is to invest in and build a massive public transit infrastructure, and augment municipal streets with alternative means of mobility, such as bike lanes.\nI question whether any planners, environmentalists, engineers or any other credentialed experts were consulted at all in the creation of this bill.\nIn summary, Bill 212 is a backwards approach to \u201creducing\u201d gridlock which will have the complete opposite effect of its stated objective: gridlock will become worse, public safety will be worse, local economies will suffer, the environment will be senselessly, irreparably destroyed, and health outcomes for Ontarians will be worse, which will end up costing us more. This bill should not move forward.\n"

        "comment": "Not extending Ontario's bike lane network could have multiple negative effects on health, the environment, and community dynamics:\nRoad Safety Risks: Without dedicated bike lanes, cyclists are often forced to share roads with cars, increasing the likelihood of accidents. Expanding bike lanes can protect cyclists, lower accident rates, and encourage safer travel for both cyclists and drivers.\nEnvironmental Impact: Car dependency means more greenhouse gas emissions. By building bike lanes, Ontario could encourage cycling as a green alternative, helping to reduce emissions, improve air quality, and contribute to climate goals.\nHealth Benefits: Cycling promotes physical activity, which is linked to lower rates of obesity, heart disease, and mental health issues. Without bike lanes, many people might avoid cycling due to safety concerns, missing out on these health benefits.\nTraffic Reduction and Accessibility: More bike lanes can reduce car traffic, especially in urban areas. This shift can make commuting more efficient and create streets that are more accessible to everyone.\nEconomic Benefits: Communities with strong biking infrastructure often see boosts in local business as cyclists stop to shop more frequently. Bike lanes also help create job opportunities in bike-related industries, including sales, repairs, and rentals.\nBy not expanding Ontario's bike lane network, these potential benefits are missed, and the province may face a future of higher pollution, traffic, and health costs.\n"
