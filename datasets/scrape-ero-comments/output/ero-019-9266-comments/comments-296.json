        "comment": "I believe it is incredulous that the province would follow through on this motion that is so clearly opposed by the people who live in the city and are affected by it. It is abhorrent how blatantly the Premier is forcing his own agenda on the city at the cost of millions of dollars and countless hours of work, just to satisfy his own desires.\nBike lanes are integral to a significant population of commuters within the city with bike share use on the rise over the years. Bike lanes are more used now than before, and while the city needs to find a solution to the dreadful congestion we've experienced on the roads; tearing up Bike lanes that have just been installed is not the answer.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my deep concern and heartfelt opposition to the amended Bill 212 - Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024. As an avid cyclist who relies on the bike lanes along Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue every day, I am outraged by the proposal to rip out this crucial infrastructure and turn our city backward.\nThese bike lanes are lifelines for thousands of us. They provide safety, freedom, and a healthier alternative to gridlock and pollution. Removing them would put lives at risk, push more people back into cars, and make our streets less safe for everyone. The idea that bike lanes are causing gridlock is simply misguided and ignores the mountain of evidence to the contrary.\nGlobal cities have shown that investing in cycling infrastructure reduces congestion and pollution. In New York City, travel times for motorists decreased by 35% after bike lanes were installed. Paris, once choked with traffic, has embraced cycling and seen car use drop dramatically. We are not different or special in Ontario\u2014what works there can and does work here. Dismantling these lanes would be a catastrophic regression.\nBike lanes make our streets safer. They slow traffic, protect vulnerable road users, and save lives. Are we willing to trade these benefits for a misguided \u201csolution\u201d that prioritizes cars over people? Every second that traffic is slowed pales in comparison to the value of a life saved or the safety of a cyclist who can commute without fear.\nWhat\u2019s more, the plan to remove bike lanes without environmental assessments is appalling. As our planet grapples with the climate crisis, we should be moving boldly toward sustainability, not undermining the progress we\u2019ve made. Every cyclist represents one fewer car on the road, one fewer source of pollution, and one step closer to a healthier future.\nWe cannot afford to gamble with our safety, our environment, or our quality of life. I urge the Ontario government to listen to the people who live, work, and ride in our cities. Keep our bike lanes, expand them, and support a vision of Ontario where everyone\u2014cyclist or driver\u2014can share the road safely and responsibly.\nPlease, don\u2019t take us backward. Keep the bike lanes, and let\u2019s build a city that works for everyone.\n"

        "comment": "Evidence from around the world has shown that removing bike lanes does not help to reduce traffic. Bill 212 goes against expert advice and will make commuting times longer for drivers. It will also significantly reduce safety on our streets.\nAs an Ontario resident, I am strongly opposed to bill 212 and urge the government to instead fund viable alternatives to driving such as transit and biking infrastructure. These measures will actually help to reduce traffic.\n"

        "comment": "I live in Etobicoke, on Bloor between Kipling and Islington. I have waited two years for the completion of the Bloor bike lanes, only to have the province threaten to tear them out a season after they've finished. Since the bike lanes have been built, I have been able to shop in the Royal York area for the first time since living here. Removing the bike lanes will prevent me from shopping locally, as the road under the train bridge is very unsafe for cyclists.\nIn my neighbourhood, thousands of new condo units are being built with no car parking which all have bike parking. What are these new residents going to do without safe bike lanes? What are the existing Kipling bike lanes, and the new Dundas BRT bike lanes, going to connect to? This seems very short sighted.\nDue to the train tracks, Mimico creek, and the Humber river, there are no other paths a cyclist can take other than Bloor street. Is the province going to fund the construction of Bike lanes along Dundas in order to allow us to cross these three barriers?\nAs a voter in Etobicoke and a new cyclist, taking this action will force me to vote for a different provincial party that properly supports growth and safe travel in my neighbourhood.\n"

        "comment": "My life does not matter? Presently I ride to work along the Bloor protected bike lane from Jane to Sherbourne and then along the Sherbourne protected bike lane to King. I do this every working day of the year but active snow days. As Bloor is virtually the only street with a protected bike lane that goes this distance (in fact, from one end of the city to the other), its removal guarantees that there would be no other safe route to ride.\nThe idea that bike lanes on this route could be installed along parallel residential streets is laughable- just look at a map! The route would be almost twice as long with the umpteen north and south jogs required, and would remove parking from all of those streets people live on. No opposition to that? Sure.\nBefore the lanes were installed, I was hit by cars 3 times. Since? Zero. I want a safe, convenient and healthy alternative to driving a car!\nThis policy is regressive and dangerous.\n"

        "comment": "Cyclist/driver/transit user here. Regarding the upgraded proposal - Removing bike lanes from Bloor/University/Yonge will likely result in cyclists still using these roads to commute. They will either take the lane (which could result in injury if drivers are not respectful), force cyclists onto sidewalks for their safety, put more ubers/taxis/cars on the road or further congest transit. If street parking is allowed, this will definitely not solve the issue of congestion while increasing risk of injury, death and liability.\nRemoving Yonge bike lanes is especially concerning because there is NO North/South alternative that covers such a large stretch. Before considering removal of the Yonge, a feasible alternative must be proposed and implemented first.\n"

The reason traffic is bad in Toronto and will continue to get worse is that there are too many cars, and not enough alternatives to driving.\nDoes Amsterdam have bad traffic because of bikes? Does Copenhagen? Does any city in the world?\nToronto in 2024 is not the Toronto of decades past. We need transit, and we need cycling infrastructure. And every single driver should be thankful for transit and cycling infrastructure since every cyclist and every train rider is one fewer car in traffic.\n"

If it's only a minute or two, is that worth the return on investment that will be spent removing the lanes?\nBike lanes are a city issue, not a province issue.  Leave it to the cities to decide what it best for themselves.\nWhy doesn't the province care more about health care and education and saving lives instead of ending them?\n"
