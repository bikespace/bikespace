The Therme Scandal ($650 Million for a parking lot so that a European company can control a public park from the next century.)\n"

        "comment": "If your government is serious about reducing gridlock, you should invest in transit not only in the flashy ways that make headlines (subways, big projects), but get into the nitty-gritty of what makes transit work: make sure more buses are on the road and they have priority lanes, make sure streetcars get REAL priority (meaning they get to skip traffic lights so they don't get bunched up and we end up with three within 10 minutes and then none for the next 25 minutes).  THESE and many more are the moves that could make a difference -- not catering to motorists when the world is facing a climate emergency.\nThe standards you apply to bike lanes to prove that they are being used is ridiculous.  Most of these lanes aren't even safe enough in the first place because of the constant need to appease drivers.\nYour proposed bike lane legislation is just another in a long line of proposals and decisions that demonstrate that you are not serious people.  Good people who actually take these matters seriously will literally die for your ignorance.  It says a lot about your character that you can sleep at night with that on your conscience.\n"

        "comment": "I am a regular driver and occasional cyclist who is strongly opposed to the Ontario Government's initiative to over-rule and control Toronto's decision-making regarding bike lanes. Doug Ford needs to stay in his own lane and out of bike lanes. The city of Toronto is fully capable of making its own decisions regarding best practices for transportation. As a driver who hasn't riden a bike in decades, he is clearly biased against their use. In my opinion, bike lanes should be expanded, not reduced. But those decisions should be left to experts who study the problem, not politicians with an election agenda.\n"

        "comment": "As someone who relies on biking due to financial constraints, I\u2019m deeply concerned about the impact of this bill. I cannot afford the costs of driving, paid rides, or even frequent bus fare, so biking is my only viable option for getting around. Due to frequent close calls with vehicles, I often ride on the sidewalk despite bylaws, because safe, accessible bike lanes are limited. However, sidewalks are not always an option, meaning I must sometimes risk my safety on busy roads.\nThis bill, which prioritizes the convenience of drivers over the safety and accessibility of cyclists like me, sends a troubling message: that my life and mobility needs are secondary to the conveniences enjoyed by those who can afford to drive. My fear is that by restricting bike lanes, this bill will force cyclists into more dangerous conditions, all to save a few minutes for car commuters. It\u2019s disheartening and frustrating to feel that my safety is being overlooked in favour of convenience.\n"

Adding a further layer of non-local approval will bring no benefit to Ontarians living and cities and will only increase bureaucracy.\nWhat's the purpose of having municipal governments if the provincial government is going to step in and override the will of local populations whenever they disagree with broader provincial political leanings? Let local governments govern locally.\n"

        "comment": "This Bill is detrimental to the future of Toronto and Ontario. A clear overreach from the Province that is only going to exacerbate the car-centric culture responsible for all the negative externalities taxpayers pay on a daily basis. Please repeal the Bill!!\nAs a Toronto resident, I drive and cycle for utilitarian purposes every day. Before I only used to drive. Now I feel more comfortable riding a bike because the dedicated infrastructure makes me feel safer.\nSafety trumps congestion. Period.\nAll of the progressive cities around the world are investing in safe transportations options for people of all ages and abilities. This Bill is against providing these options just to save a few minutes for a minority of people who drive from the suburbs.\nThe Minister seems unqualified for his job and does not represent the interests of vulnerable groups or the majority of Toronto residents who do NOT drive. His recent opinion piece on The Toronto Star is clear evidence of his elitism bias assuming everyone experiences his sour commute. There is no evidence bike lanes are actually responsible for added congestion. All the literature and every professional 21st century urbanist can demonstrate that. It is preposterous that all the progress Toronto has made to offer residents safer and environmentally friendly options will be undermined by this Bill.\nThe Province should have no business with City-owned streets. Let residents and the community be the  judges of cycling projects through the proper project-specific consultation processes. Please stop meddling with local affairs and focus on the things that really matter (getting more transit projects realized and keeping highways in a good state). You are creating unnecessary culture wars that are only diving community members more instead of uniting use through positive common causes (e.g. addressing the climate crisis).\nPlease repeal this Bill!!\n"

        "comment": "This is absolutely ridiculous. The provincial government has no business deciding on municipal matters like bike lines on the roads. For the party that advocates for small government they sure have no problem overreaching in Toronto. Should we remove the bike lanes in every city because Ford doesn't like them?\nNot to mention bike lanes help congestion not hurt them by getting more people out of their cars and onto bikes. It also keeps them out of car lanes where they do more to slow things down.\nFurthermore it's an issue of safety. Bikes are simply not cars and pretending they are only causes frustrated drivers and accidents when bikers get hit by several thousand pounds of metal.\nAnyone that's travelled outside of Canada knows that our public transit infrastructure isn't just bad but straight embarrassing compared to the rest of the world. How about Ford focuses on getting the Eglinton line open? Or the subway improvements destroying Queen Street? Or maybe we could finally run the go trains consistently on all the lines which doesn't require any new infrastructure and would do far more for congestion than anything else.\nOlivia Chow said it best: \"stay in your lane\".\n"

        "comment": "Below you will find my comments related to Bill 212. I strongly oppose the recommendations in the proposal as set out below.\nBike lanes:\nHow can you propose legislation on bike lanes without better defining the criteria under which prescribed municipalities will be held to account \u2013 this is opaque and leaves no accountability to the government.\nAs the government of Ontario, stay out of municipal matters \u2013 you have bigger issues to deal with like health care. Ford did not get elected mayor of Toronto, so he should stop meddling as if he did.\nBike lanes provide safety and a physical gap between motor vehicles and cyclists. They are literally saving lives. If you don\u2019t allow municipalities to build bike lanes where they feel is best, you will have blood on your hands. There is no reason to divert bike lanes to side streets -  Bikes have equal right to any other vehicle to take the shortest, most expedient path of least resistance to their destination.\nHow much tax payer money are you going to waste this time in removing lanes that have already had tax payer money to install them. Let\u2019s have a bit of common sense here!\nBased on your opposition to Bike lanes, why not start by improving any of the following issues that would improve traffic:\nRemove street parking\nRemove construction taking up a full lane of traffic\nImprove and actually complete public transit projects on time (ahem, Metrolinx)\nImprove traffic light timing\nHighways:\nI am vehemently opposed to the need for highway 413, and even more so opposed to the proposal in Schedule 3 of this proposal to exempt the Environmental Assessment Act in relation to all activities associated with the proposed development of highway 413.  The Ontario PC\u2019s have done enough damage as is and gone against their election promises related to intrusion into the Greenbelt -  this is just another example of that same approach. I look forward to the RCMP investigation into the matter.\n"

Removing cars off the roads and providing Ontario residents with other transportation options needs to be a priority. Removing existing bike lanes is not the answer. Enhancing these lanes and roads so they can be used together with cars can work but the outright removal is not what is needed.\nWe need more trains, more bike lanes and less cars.

Municipalities have their own level of government and are closer to the specific needs of their towns & cities.

The single proposed metric for bike lane is geared to the immediate needs of motor vehicle traffic.\nThe value of a bike lane should be  found in by the existing environmental impact of motorized vehicles and the impact of the bike lane on emission reduction targets.\nAnd not least, the value of a bike lane should be found in the lives it could save by separating bike traffic from motorized traffic.\nAs a cyclist, transit user, car passenger, and taxpayer, our expanding bike lane network has improved the quality of life for me and others. Please do not undo the progress that has been made.\n"

Removing bike lanes simply forces cyclists onto the road or sidewalk, resulting in more congestion for cars and far less safety for cyclists.\nYou would think that a city with such a serious gridlock problem would be doing more to encourage people to use their cars less often, yet the opposite is occurring.\nThe proposed policy to remove bike lanes and to halt their construction where a traffic lane needs to be removed will have the opposite effect that is intended. Mr Ford should consult actual urban planners instead of making uninformed decisions based entirely on populism.\n"
