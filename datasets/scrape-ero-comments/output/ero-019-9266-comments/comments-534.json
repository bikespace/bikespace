        "comment": "This bill is both severely ill-advised and counterproductive, and I am NOT in favour. I will not have my tax dollars go towards ripping out existing infrastructure that, counter to the Ford government's claims, actually DOES help reduce traffic congestion. As someone who works at SickKids Hospital, directly in the affected area, I can confidently say that the existence of the University Ave bike lanes helps keep the space accessible, and reduces traffic as it is used by cyclists consistently throughout the day and the entire year. Bike lanes are good for the environment, good for pedestrians, and good for reducing car traffic, and this government's determination to destroy perfectly good existing infrastructure and prevent their construction elsewhere is honestly disgusting.\n"

        "comment": "I am a daily cyclist and lawyer. I commute to work and home every day on my bike. I'm a lifelong Toronto resident who grew up in both North York and Etobicoke; two areas of the city where until recently there was a lack of bike infrastructure.\nEvery day I bike to work and face the risk of injury or death. While this may seem like an exaggeration, the majority of City streets do not have separated bike lanes and require cyclists to share lanes with 2 ton vehicles. Every day I ring my bell at a car that comes too close to me, opens a door when parking or doesn't check their blindspot when making a turn. Biking in the city is already extremely dangerous and Bill 212 further serves to risk the lives of Ontario residents. We too are taxpayers and voters and deserve respect from the Government.\nGridlock is real. Fewer cars on the road in the form of cyclists, pedestrians and public transit users helps with gridlock. Ripping out bike lanes prioritizes a minute of a driver's time over the life of a cyclist.\nYou are a Conservative government that should care about fiscal responsibility and the efficient use of our tax dollars. Ripping up existing bike lanes is neither responsible nor efficient.\n"

        "comment": "It\u2019s essential to highlight the importance of protecting and expanding cycling infrastructure to prevent road deaths and support urban transit goals. Cyclist fatalities in Ontario are currently at their highest since 2021, underscoring an urgent need for improved cycling infrastructure rather than its reduction.\nBill 212 references that only 1.2% of commuters in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) use bicycles, which does not reflect downtown Toronto\u2019s high rates of cycle commuting. In downtown neighborhoods, around 44% of residents cycle regularly for work, shopping, and meeting friends. BikeShare Toronto usage has increased substantially, with annual trips rising from 665,000 in 2015 to over 6 million in 2024, further emphasizing the strong demand for cycling options.\nEvidence from various global studies demonstrates that well-designed bike lanes contribute significantly to reducing vehicle congestion rather than increasing it. For example, research has shown that bike lanes help streamline urban traffic flow by encouraging more people to use bicycles, thereby reducing the number of cars on the road. Cities with established bike lanes, such as Amsterdam and Copenhagen, have achieved both safer streets for cyclists and reduced road congestion for vehicles. In Toronto, bike lanes on Bloor Street have been particularly effective in increasing safety and accessibility without detrimentally impacting traffic flow.\nAdditionally, Bill 212 appears to overstep provincial jurisdiction by potentially mandating the removal of key bike lanes on Bloor, Yonge, and University without substantiating data on its benefits. While the bill requests municipalities to report on vehicle travel times, it proposes the removal of bike lanes on major Toronto streets without supporting data to justify this action. This approach disregards the positive impacts of bike lanes on both safety and congestion reduction. Toronto has invested significantly in cycling infrastructure to support sustainable and safe transit, and this bill threatens to undermine these efforts.\nProtecting Toronto\u2019s cycling infrastructure is crucial to ensuring safer streets, reducing congestion, and supporting a growing demand for sustainable transit alternatives. This decision should be informed by local commuting data and evidence-based research on urban transit, rather than broad policies that lack local context.\n"

        "comment": "As a Car owner in Toronto. I find many of the suggestions within this bill insultingly unscientific and without any consideration of empirical evidence. Study after study highlights how encouraging bike use leads to safer and less busy roads for all (one cited below). Other cities provide strong evidence that installing bike lanes in Paris has lead to a 5% decrease in the amount of cars on the road (less cars means less traffic). Evidence of the well known and empirically backed up phenomenon \u201cinduced demand\u201d showcases how increasing car lanes does not lead to less cars on the road. The complete opposite occurs, with roads becoming more clogged as more people turn to cars as their only option to commute. Supporters of this bill point to a report showcasing how Bloor street has rapidly increased in traffic since the installation of bike lanes; however, the inference that this is due to bike lanes is shaky. The extreme confounding variable present here is the end of Covid and the return to office that has brought people back into the city. More data is required in this post Covid era before one can start pointing at scape goats.\nAgain, as a car owner, I feel as though these policies will make my commute and ability to easily travel around the city and gta harder. To meet the ever growing population and transit needs of the gta, Ontario must invest in ALL means of transit (trains, subways, bike lanes, and busses) to encourage less cars on the road for better commutes. The obsession with roads will bring minimum relief to traffic. As a young professional working hard to make Toronto a great place to live for all, I feel compelled to move to more transit friendly cities such as New York or Chicago should these types of short sided policies continue to plague our legislative. I urge you to support bills that are founded in strong research and empirical evidence, rather than vague hutches that hurt everyone.\n"

        "comment": "We need to stick to the right vision for the City of Toronto and the Province of Ontario.\nDo we want a livable, healthy city and province with a high quality of life and excellent air quality?\nI oppose this bill to give extra rights to the Minister of Transport to single handedly determine which bike lanes to approve or remove.  This is a municipal matter and these decisions should be made by the people closest to the matter. Building bike lanes now in the suburbs of the city will encourage more bike riders as it is cheaper and healthier.  Riders will start to rider more because they will feel safe from motor traffic.  Downtown is where it is needed the most, not more lanes for cars and trucks.  Delivery trucks that part illegally are causing problems by cutting off the bike lanes and blocking vehicle lanes. If the Ministry would like to make a difference, please work with businesses that do rely on deliveries, by perhaps incentivizing deliveries during off hours and spreading out the density of traffic by encouraging users of Public transit and bikes.\nThe presence of bike lanes supports that vision. Given population growth, Toronto is densifying. In my own neighbourhood of Riverdale a 49 story condo building is being built at the corner of Pape and Danforth. There will be thousands of new residents moving in.\nWe need multiple options for commuting. Bike lanes provide an economical, healthy, environmentally-sound and safe way to commute. The province needs to be investing in more bike lanes, not removing bike lines. The answer to gridlock is to get more cars off the road and more bikes onto the road and to enhance the public transit system. Bike lanes and public transit is where the province should be investing. In addition, municipal governments know their local needs best. It is an overreach for the province to try to take control over where bike lines should and should not be.\nI strongly oppose the proposed Bill 212 for these reasons and others. The Province would be more successful in addressing gridlock by investing in public transit and in bike lanes.\n\u2014\u2014\nI am a longtime resident of Toronto. I get around the city by many means: bike, public transit, foot and car. I do not think the proposed legislation is sound for many reasons.\n1. Municipalities know their needs best so decisions regarding bike lanes should remain a municipal government responsibility not a provincial one.\n2.  Bike lanes provide a safer way for residents to get around the city by bike/e-bike/e-scooter/hover board and roller blade resulting in fewer cars on the road.\n3. Bike lanes save lives and minimize accidents. Their removal would result in more serious injuries and deaths.\n4. Studies show that bike lanes do not contribute to gridlock even when a car lane has had to be removed to allow for the creation of a bike lane. This is evidence-based.\n5. Bike lanes allow residents to travel without getting in a car thereby reducing carbon emissions from cars. Bike lanes contribute to better air quality.\n6. Bike lanes provide a healthy alternative and improve users\u2019 health and the city\u2019s livability.\nIf the intent is to reduce gridlock then the answer lies in investing in public transit and more bike lanes. I oppose the proposed legislation. Thank you for the opportunity to submit my comments which I hope have an impact.\n"

I am a driver who regularly drives on the streets (Bloor, Yonge, University) where the bike lanes will be removed.\nLet me be crystal clear: this is a spiteful, cowardly initiative that will do absolutely nothing to improve traffic in Toronto. Instead, it will make things worse for both drivers and cyclists and directly lead to deaths on our roads. It is plainly obvious that no amount of contrary evidence will alter this proposal. This is all about trying to divide Ontarians before an election.\nTo Minister Sarkaria and the MTO MO: if you had any integrity you would resign before enacting such a pathetic edict from the Premier. Many years from now, your political legacy will not be building transit or highways or \"Getting it Done\", but that you made a craven decision today that killed someone's son or daughter, all just to score a cheap political point. Imagine it was your son or daughter. Think about the grief that those families will feel. I hope that you are reminded of this with every funeral of a cyclist you caused by this decision. I hope too that the shame and guilt you should feel haunt you long after you have left political life.\n"

Ensuring adequate environmental assessments are conducted for all major infrastructure projects is of vital importance and there should be no exceptions made for highway 413. A desire to expedite the project should not override the requirements under the Environmental Assessment Act.\n- The Expropriations Act should continue to apply to all expropriations of land, there should be no exception for expropriations made under section 10 of the Ministry of Infrastructure Act, 2011. All people deserve to continue to benefit from the protections of the Expropriations Act and should be allowed due and fair process when facing an expropriation of their land.\n- Ministry approval should not be required for the building of infrastructure within municipal jurisdictions. Bike lane infrastructure most predominately affects those within a given municipality and should therefore be subject to the plans set forth by the municipal government who was elected by the people within that jurisdiction. The provincial government is overstepping their lane by interfering in these decisions and is undermining the electoral process by making choices for people who did not elect them to do so.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to comment specifically on section 195.2, regarding the construction of bicycle lanes in municipalities. As a Toronto resident who uses a bicycle as a mode of transportation, and in the past has used it as a primary mode, I believe the bicycle lanes that have been constructed in the city have made the streets safer and more organised for both motorists and cyclists. As for their impact on traffic, in many areas of Yonge, Bloor and University, a lane of traffic was not removed in order to accommodate them; space previously used for on-street parking was adjusted to make room for them. Thus, removing the bike lane would not restore a driving lane as promised. In other areas, bike lanes have required the removal of turning lanes; are there not alternatives to compensating for such changes?\nSection 195.2 specifically mentions \u201chighways,\u201d which from what I understand is what allows the Ministry to regulate Yonge, Bloor and University streets. The rationale stated elsewhere is these are arterial roads, and traffic should flow freely on them. If so, why is on-street parking allowed on these streets? Prior to the construction of the Bloor bike lanes, I frequently observed slowed motorist traffic during rush hour due to parked or stopped vehicles. If the goal of the Bill is to reduce motorist gridlock, why does it not address this? Furthermore, as a resident of an uptown neighbourhood, Yonge and Avenue Road are my only convenient links north and south; there are no alternative routes. This is the very nature of arterial roads, for cyclists as well as drivers.\nThis brings to my final point, is that these proposed changes will not remove cyclists from these roads. I can speak to first-hand experience that the Bloor Street bike lanes were built in response to the number of cyclists using that route. Removing the bike lanes will return everyone to the time of mixed traffic, which I do not believe will result in the benefit that is being sought.\nPlease reconsider these changes. Thank you.\n"
