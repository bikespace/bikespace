        "comment": "I do not understand why the Ontario government wants to implement such a short-term policy of spending more money to remove all the bike lanes after we have already spent all this time and money to get them all approved and built. Especially since many (most?) civil engineers and urban planners are beginning to agree that providing alternatives to driving is the only long term solution to dealing with population growth and meeting environmental goals. We can't keep looking to the urban development strategies of the 1960s Robert Moses era when we now have overwhelming evidence of the damage they've done to cities across North America.\nDedicated separated bike lanes keep cars and cyclists apart, improving safety and speed for both. When I ride my bike somewhere that has separated bike lanes, I'm not really worried about my safety. I don't have large vehicles passing uncomfortably close, sometimes at speeds of 80 km/h (or more). If a car so much as grazes me in those situations, I'm almost certainly dead.\nI've had a few close calls over the past few decades of cycling. Thanks to all the new bike lanes we've built, I often don't think of cycling as a high-risk sport like rock climbing or skiing. It's something I can do to pick up groceries or get to a concert or game, thanks to the new bike lanes we've built in the last few years. I'd stopped biking when I moved to the city, opting instead to drive the few blocks to the nearby grocery store. The bike lanes we've built along Danforth in the last few years have allowed me to start biking there and back instead, and even to my job during rush hour in the summer. Do you want me back in a car during rush hour?\nWhen I drive places, not having to worry about giving cyclists space when I pass them is also amazing. When passing a cyclist and the oncoming lane is busy, I often have to do this awkward dance of getting dangerously close to oncoming vehicles to give the cyclist enough room. If I can't pass safely, I'm stuck going as fast as the cyclist and increasing the road rage and angry honking of the people stuck behind me. So let's get them off the road by building them lanes. Not only that, but making biking safer will encourage people to bike instead of drive, which will get even more people off the road. Win-win!\nThe only cyclists we're going to get off the road by tearing out all the existing bike lanes are casual cyclists like you and me. But if you've ridden in the last few years since the pandemic, you know that the majority of cyclists are delivery drivers. They don't get into cars. Professional cyclists, like taxi drivers, are more than happy to play the aggressive road game with cars. They've got a job to do, with our without a dedicated bike lane. I don't want to have to deal with them on the street when I go somewhere, so let's build bike infrastructure.\nOne more lane isn't going to fix it. Seriously, look up Marchetti's constant and Braess's paradox. We have a lot of research from decades of highway construction that shows the problem is inescapable with every highway design we've tried.  It's why we now have both the widest highway in North America and the worst traffic all on the same highway, and we're not even a third the size of New York or Mexico City, both of which still have reasonable congestion. Why is that? They both spent their transportation money over the last few decades on rail, bike, and pedestrian infrastructure, all of which have lower lifetime costs and higher commuter throughput than roads. It's just cost effective.\nFrom a casual look at available research data, a single lane of cars can move about 2,000 people per hour, while the same lane for bikes can move 14,000 per hour. By replacing bike lanes with car lanes, we're reducing, not increasing, the number of people who can commute through the city. In case you were wondering, why has commuting gotten so slow since we built them? It's population growth. Since the pandemic started in 2019, there are over a million more people commuting into the city. That's the other problem with roads, they don't slow down linearly. They work fine up to about 70-80% capacity, and then suddenly they slow down significantly. Having so many people commuting has pushed us over that limit. Adding a few more lanes isn't going to give us that much headroom.\nPeople drive when it's the most convenient way to get somewhere. If we reduce transportation options or make them impractical, we'll all be forced to get in our cars. I love that, depending on the distance, I can take the train, catch a flight, or ride my bike to my destination. The reality of southern Ontario makes anything but driving a non-starter in most places. I'd trade my flights for train travel, but Via Rail is slow and way too expensive. Go trains are far too infrequent on many routes, which means I often drive to a lot of places outside the city even though Go Train technically has a route that goes there. Inside the city, I can take the TTC just about anywhere long distance, and bike to a lot of medium to local places. As we've gotten more bike infrastructure, I've only imagined that this would increase. Hearing that we're going to remove all our bike lanes means I'll probably just get back in my car for short trips.\nTo solve the congestion problem, you need to fix the number, size and occupancy of cars coming into the city. You could subsidize telecommuting initiatives, give tax breaks to large employers/developers to build office buildings outside of Toronto, build more rail into the city and run more trains more often to get commuters off the road, put a toll on the DVP, discourage private cars from driving between Dufferin-Bloor-Parlement and build free parking structures on the outskirts, provide tax breaks or free parking for small cars and carpools, remove that one lane on the 401 that ends just past Salem in Ajax (so much traffic heading east is the result of that one lane ending).\nIn short, part of the solution is to get people out of cars and onto bikes, not off bikes and into cars. The bigger solution will require us to think more broadly than just cars when planning our transportation infrastructure for the next half century. I know it doesn't poll well, but trying not to deal with it for so long is why things have gotten so bad.\n"

        "comment": "As a longtime resident of Toronto who both owns a car and cycles in the city, I am absolutely confident the major issues with gridlock in this province come from the underfunding of regional transit infrastructure and large trucks clogging our highways. Instead of eliminating or limiting bike lanes, the province should work within their existing powers to improve these areas: fund GO, the TTC, and work to install high speed rail between Niagara Falls and Montreal, and allow trucks to use the 407 toll-free. Bike lanes on major arteries save taxpayers time, money, and lives. Let cities decide what is best for their residents on their roads.\n"

Why is the provincial government so anti- science and anti- data?\nData shows that bike lanes improve gridlock, often by taking cars off the road or by improving traffic flow.\nDoug Ford has explicitly acknowledged that removing bike lanes will likely result in making roads less safe for cyclists and possibly lead to more deaths.\nIncreased infrastructure for biking has been shown time and again, across Canada and the world, to increase the number of people cycling. This leads to fewer gridlock-causing cars.\n"

Cycling on the road with large SUVs and trucks is incredibly dangerous. I cannot afford the disappearance of bike lanes and neither can Ontario's healthcare system.\nI've cycled in Toronto for 6 years, and personally witnessed two fatal accidents. Cyclists are our mothers, fathers, sons and daughters. Every year we kill and injure dozens of Ontarions as a result of poor infrastructure that has historically benefited drivers above all else.\nIn recent years it has felt like we have turned a page, and had begun to take cycling infrastructure more seriously in this province, to the benefit of everyone. This proposal would send us backwards.\n"

Studies show that it's cars and not bikes that contribute to road congestion, especially when you consider that without bike infrastructure even more people are encouraged to drive leading to further gridlock. I can only speak to the GTA and not other municipalities. We would benefit from more transit infrastructure and alternative modes of transport rather than car heavy infrastructure. Please reconsider reducing or removing infrastructure for bikes.\n"

        "comment": "The premier and minister has continually referred to the goal of this to improve traffic flow - what they fail to consider is that cyclists *are* traffic.  Like drivers they are trying to get where they are going as quickly as possible, as safely as possible and by a mode of transportation that isn't a car.  To suggest that cyclists 'just use side streets' ignores the fact that cyclists, especially ones cycling in three or four seasons are more exposed to weather and road conditions, the city does not have a good program for regular clearing of bike lanes and the main roads are usually the only ones with bridges and other accesses across obstacles or the most direct to and from main work/living areas.\nThe backlash from drivers is simply the effect of for the first time ever needing to share the infrastructural pie.  Cyclists and public transit users pay taxes and participate in the economy just the same as drivers - and you might argue that since some of the drivers are commuting from out of jurisdiction (and thus not paying to maintain those roads) that cyclists are *more* entitled to the infrastructure than a nonresident driver.\nAcademic studies are completely clear - more lanes don't reduce traffic gridlock - otherwise the 401 would flow freely all the time.  Induced demand is real and eliminating bike lanes will do nothing in the medium run to actually address any of the issues.\nInduced demand works for cyclists too - when more cycling infrastructure is availiable - particular cycling infrastructure that makes cyclists feel safe like cycle tracks, cycling goes up.  See the growth of Toronto bike share or Toronto studies on bike traffic growth following installation of bike lanes.\nArguments about seasonability are also readily debunked - far from 'nobody' cycles in the winter.  If we use Bike Share Toronto data - the winter cycling volume is approximately 20% of the Summer peak volume - and Feb 2024 data (usually the lowest ridership month) looks to be approximately the same as the 2023 average across the whole year.  Also Montreal has more severe winters than Toronto - but double the bike lanes, a specific program for snow removal that seems to increase winter ridership drastically.\nIf I can't bike safely then i'll need to get a car - if I get a car then the lanes freed up by removing the bike lane get used up by my car.\nIt also isn't clear that bike lanes even cause congestion - there are several notable examples where congestion goes down once signal timing and other change are implemented - notably:\nMajor City Studies\nNew York City: After installing protected bike lanes on 9th Avenue, travel times for vehicles decreased by 35% in the corridor\nLondon: Cycling improvements on several major corridors showed neutral or positive impacts on vehicle flow\nToronto: Richmond-Adelaide cycle tracks study showed vehicle travel times remained stable or improved after bike lane installation\n\"Making Way for Green Modes\" (Transport Reviews, 2021)\nAnalysis of 23 case studies\nFound no evidence of worsened congestion after bike lane installation\nPositive Impact Cases: Adding Bike Lanes\n1.

Cars are getting bigger and heavier and evidence from speed cameras is that drivers continue to drive them at or above posted speed limits.  Fewer bike lanes lead to more cyclist deaths - its as simple as that - and when weighing a few extra minutes of a drivers time vs. a cyclists life there is really no comparison.\nReferences for induced demand:\nSpeck, J., & Speck, J.

        "comment": "Bill 212 represents a misguided use of taxpayer money, centered around a divisive political issue. Bike lanes, especially protected ones, provide a safe, efficient alternative to car travel, offering residents the choice to adopt more sustainable transportation methods. Limiting or removing bike lanes will only exacerbate traffic congestion, as more cars return to already overcrowded roads. The best way to alleviate gridlock is by expanding diverse, affordable, and reliable public transit options that serve the needs of all citizens.\nMany city residents would prefer public transit over the high costs of car ownership\u2014expenses such as purchasing, maintaining, insuring, fueling, and parking a vehicle, not to mention the risk of theft. The focus should shift toward improving public transit systems and addressing other pressing issues, including housing, homelessness, social services, mental health and addiction treatment, healthcare, and education.\nInvesting in these areas will provide long-term benefits for the entire community, rather than wasting resources on counterproductive measures like Bill 212.\n"

        "comment": "I wholeheartedly oppose Bill 212. I bike, drive, and take transit in downtown Toronto, giving me firsthand experience with the city\u2019s transportation challenges from all perspectives. In my experience, bike lanes have never been the cause of our traffic woes, and nothing the Ontario government has proposed has changed that understanding. The recent measures outlined in Bill 212 overlook decades of research, consultations, and real-world data that show bike lanes are essential to the communities they serve. The City of Toronto alone has surely spent thousands or even millions of dollars already validating this. Reversing the course on bike infrastructure now would be a costly decision, particularly when we are already looking for funds to support projects like the proposed multi-billion-dollar 401 tunnel.\nCongestion in Toronto has undeniably worsened, but bike lanes are not the root cause by any measure. Ongoing construction projects, such as the Ontario Line, have pushed our streets to their limits, while inexplicable delays in critical transit lines like the Hurontario LRT, Eglinton Crosstown LRT, and Finch West LRT continue to leave fewer viable alternatives to driving. This lack of coordination and persistent delays, not bike lanes, are the real issue. The current situation also underscores the chronic underfunding of public transit, which has undermined the delivery of efficient service in Toronto. Our issues hardly require visionary thinking\u2014in fact, they demand basic accountability: completing projects on time and properly funding existing transit services would do far more to ease traffic than what Bill 212 proposes. Taking Bill 212 at face value, the proposed solution would be a net negative in every conceivable way.\nSetting aside congestion, I must say that I consider Safety to be the most critical issue to consider here. As the Toronto Star recently noted, between August 2014 and August 2024, there were 1,487 collisions on Parkside Drive alone, five of which led to serious injuries and two resulted in deaths. The city\u2019s own reports highlight that Parkside\u2019s current design is not up to standard for sidewalks, motor vehicle lanes, or cyclist protection. Blocking the installation of bike lanes in areas like Parkside would leave these safety concerns dramatically unaddressed. It\u2019s important to recognize that bike lanes aren\u2019t just a matter of transit convenience\u2014they are a matter of public safety, and the evidence shows they save lives. Moving forward without addressing these risks would have serious consequences for the safety of road users.\nAnother concern is the bill\u2019s exemption for major highway projects like Highway 413 from environmental assessment requirements. This raises questions about Ontario\u2019s commitment to sustainability. Bike lanes are a proven way to reduce emissions and promote greener modes of transportation. Prioritizing highways over sustainable infrastructure sends the wrong message about the province\u2019s long-term environmental goals.\nAt a time when cities like Toronto are struggling to fund vital infrastructure projects, it\u2019s critical to avoid creating unnecessary financial and administrative hurdles. By imposing delays and potentially blocking projects like bike lanes that have already been thoroughly researched and approved, we risk putting additional strain on municipalities that are already stretched thin. Instead, we should be focusing on moving forward with cost-effective solutions that benefit all residents, especially those that enhance safety and support sustainable growth.\nWe need to build a city that works for all its people\u2014not just cars. Safe, accessible routes for everyone\u2014whether they walk, bike, drive, or take transit\u2014must be a priority. A city built for the future\u2014where 15-minute cities are possible, where alternative modes of transit flourish, and where quality of life improves for all\u2014will always include bike lanes. I urge the government to ensure that its decisions are based on evidence, support long-term progress, and serve the needs of all citizens. Toronto\u2019s future depends on it.\n"
