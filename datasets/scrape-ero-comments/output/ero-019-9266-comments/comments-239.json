        "comment": "This is terrible legislation on multiple levels.\nFirst, it is an absurd overreach of provincial power. Why is the province wasting its time and resources micro managing municipalities?\nSecond, ripping out existing bike lines is a complete waste of taxpayer money.\nYou want to reduce gridlock? You need to reduce the number of people in cars. That's it. There is data provided demonstrating this. You will not solve gridlock with new lanes, highway 413 or by wasting billions of dollars on a tunnel. You need to\na) Divert people away from high density areas. People should not be growing THROUGH Toronto unless their destination is in Toronto (congestion pricing)\nb) Providing effective alternative transport methods such as robust public transit and avenues for active transport (LIKE BIKE LANES), so people can do things other then drive.\nc) Change zoning laws to allow for more mixed use neighbourhoods so more people can live close to where they work so they don't have to commute, or at the very least, live close to shops and services so they can access the majority of what they need either without a car, or with a very short drive.\nIf you pass legislation like this, the blood of every cyclist killed on our roads will be on your hands\n"

Putting more cars on the road does nothing to move people more quickly. We need options that move people in a more efficient manner.  Bike lanes, trains and even busses are what need to be expanded.   One need only look at European countries for examples of how this could work.   Please, don\u2019t go backward in our attempts to decrease greenhouse gasses and our efforts to move people efficiently.\n"

        "comment": "The minimally used bike lanes on Yonge Street and Bloor Street are causing significant congestion and overall frustrations for motorists who have no other option then to drive. A bike lane that takes up a lane of traffic in an already densely populated city is a poorly designed one. Not everyone can ride a bike to get to where they are going and the public transit system is not adequately designed not to mention dangerous. People need to drive and drivers should not be punished by having to accept  the consequences of poor city planning.\n"

I will repeat it again - the ONLY solution to car traffic is viable alternatives to driving. Adding a layer of red tape to constructions of new bike lanes will make it that much harder for municipalities to grow in a way that facilitates human-scale, productive, vibrant, walkable neighbourhoods. Why does the provincial government believe that it knows what a community needs better than those who live and work there? Car-centric urban development is the core of what makes North American cities miserable to travel and live in.\n"

        "comment": "The proposed legislation requiring municipalities to obtain provincial approval to implement new bike lanes that would remove existing car lanes is based on flawed assumptions about how to address traffic congestion. The approach fails to acknowledge evidence from urban planning and transportation studies, which show that more roads and highways do not resolve congestion. Furthermore, it overlooks research demonstrating that bike lanes do not increase congestion but rather provide substantial benefits for local economies, public health, and community connectivity.\nIncreasing Highways and Roads Does Not Reduce Congestion\nThe notion that new highways or expanded roadways reduce traffic congestion has been consistently debunked. The phenomenon of \u201cinduced demand\u201d shows that increasing roadway capacity only encourages more driving, thereby returning congestion to prior levels or even worsening it over time. Research in Texas, California, and New York has shown that adding highway lanes or constructing new highways initially reduces congestion but leads to increased vehicle miles traveled (VMT) in the long term. Specifically, studies from the University of California, Davis, and Texas A&M Transportation Institute show that adding new lanes leads to a nearly proportional increase in traffic within five years.\nInstead, municipalities worldwide have achieved congestion reduction by investing in multimodal transportation solutions, including cycling infrastructure. For instance, Paris and Amsterdam have reduced road congestion by emphasizing active transport and decreasing car dependency through extensive networks of protected bike lanes and pedestrian infrastructure. In these cases, cycling infrastructure has led to substantial decreases in traffic volume and an overall reduction in congestion.\nBike Lanes Alleviate, Not Contribute to, Congestion\nBike lanes can actually alleviate traffic congestion by offering residents a safe and efficient alternative to driving, particularly for shorter trips, which constitute a significant proportion of urban traffic. Cycling infrastructure allows for more people to be transported within the same space, moving more people while using fewer resources than car-centric transportation. In Toronto, the Bloor Street bike lanes have improved transportation efficiency and safety without increasing congestion. Data from the Toronto Centre for Active Transportation show that businesses in the area experienced economic growth after bike lanes were installed.\nFurthermore, studies from New York and Minneapolis show that bike lanes can reduce pressure on existing roadways. New York\u2019s protected bike lanes on major routes like 8th Avenue have led to a reduction in car traffic volumes by facilitating quicker, safer travel for cyclists, in turn reducing vehicle-to-vehicle interactions and incidents, which are major contributors to congestion.\nImportance of Multimodal Infrastructure Over Car Dependency\nExpanding multimodal infrastructure\u2014such as bike lanes, public transit, and pedestrian spaces\u2014reduces dependence on cars, which is crucial in addressing congestion in growing urban environments. Cities that prioritize multimodal transport options see lower rates of gridlock. For instance, Copenhagen and Barcelona have reduced car traffic and congestion by investing in integrated cycling infrastructure and transit systems. These initiatives have made transportation more efficient and accessible for all residents while cutting down on emissions and improving air quality.\nEconomic, Health, and Environmental Benefits of Cycling Infrastructure\nIn addition to alleviating congestion, cycling infrastructure provides significant economic, health, and environmental benefits. Studies from Portland State University show that retail sales along streets with bike lanes often outperform those without them, as bike lanes increase foot and bike traffic that benefits local businesses. This is evident not only in international cities but also in Canadian settings, such as along Bloor Street in Toronto, where businesses have reported increased or stable customer visits and sales following bike lane installation.\nCycling infrastructure also promotes public health by encouraging active transportation, reducing car-related air pollution, and improving mental well-being. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), active transport options, including bike lanes, are essential to addressing public health crises related to air pollution and sedentary lifestyles.\nThe proposed legislation restricting municipalities from implementing new bike lanes contradicts evidence-based transportation and urban planning strategies that demonstrate the value of cycling infrastructure in reducing congestion and enhancing community livability. Instead of mandating approvals for bike lanes, the province would benefit from supporting municipalities in creating multimodal infrastructure that provides residents with safer, more efficient, and healthier transportation options. A comprehensive approach that includes bike lanes, pedestrian areas, and public transit investments will foster a resilient, economically vibrant Ontario equipped to meet the demands of a growing population.\n"

Sounds like you have no intention of helping your constituents live long and healthy lives.\nI continue to be embarrassed by your incredibly poor use of public funds and your disregard for what most Ontarians want and need.\nMore people want to take public transportation and use other non-car methods of transportation. I promise you that. The reason people are taking cars more and more is the complete lack of safe and reliable infrastructure and resources to do so. And that is on you, the federal government, and our municipalities. No, you are not alone in creating worse living situations for Ontarians, but you are absolutely a big part of the problem.\nI demand that you do not make the creation of safe transportation infrastructure more difficult. Put your time and energy to good use and stop with Bill 212.\nCheers,\nMaddy\n"

        "comment": "Ripping out existing bike lanes so that cars and trucks will have more lanes for so called easing congestion is a waste of taxpayer's money!  It is often more expensive to rip out bike lanes than it is to build good biking infrastrucure.  Instead of spending money on ripping out existing bikes lanes, the money could be better spent on housing, health care, education or improving access to public transit.\nI feel the province is overreaching with this draconian law.  Local infrastructure should remain with municipalities as they are closer to the people and communities that they serve.  Provincial government should but out.\nProvincial governments do not like when the federal government overrides their jurisdiction and interferes with provincial responsibilities. The same goes for municipalities, they do not like it when the provincial governments override their jurisdiction and interfere with municipalities responsibilities.\n"
