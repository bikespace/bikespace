Not only will it make our roads more unsafe for people who cycle, walk or drive it is also yet another overstep on the authority of municipalities.\nThe legislation will also put unnecessary financial strain on taxpayers for the potential cost of removing existing bike lanes and will add more not less bureaucracy and red tape to approval of new and in many cases, already-approved active transportation projects.\nOntarians do not want another culture war and more division - they want for themselves and their families to be safe on the road.\nOntarians know that easing traffic congestion is about giving people more transportation options, not fewer. We want to achieve net zero for a greener, healthier future and want our communities to be connected so that not every trip to school, to the store, or to work has to be taken by car.\nAs reported in a recent CBC article, the data is clear, building more car lanes and widening roads does not ease gridlock and building more bike lanes does not make it worse but in fact does the opposite.\nWe need bike lanes, and we don't want the province saying where they can or can't be built because bike lanes are good for the environment, good for business, for personal and public health and they save lives.\nPlease listen to residents of this province, the majority oppose this misinformed piece of legislation.\n"

        "comment": "This is a terrible idea! First of all will it lead to the death of cyclists who are no longer protected on roads. But since the only constituents that you seem concerned about are drivers let's consider the impacts on them. For example, I currently take my daughter to daycare on a bike but if that no longer feels safe I will be forced to drive a car. This means I will be adding to the gridlock on the vast majority of streets and highways that do not have bike lanes. How will this benefit drivers? One of the points in this bill is about making data used to inform bike lane decisions public. That seems like a good idea, in the spirit of that where is your data that will explain how pushing cyclists out of safe bike lanes will affect traffic? Where will those commuters go? Many like myself will likely start driving more and contributing to gridlock. Others who don't have the luxury of owning a car will end up on our already overwhelmed and under services transit systems. The remained who continue to cycle will be less safe and more likely to end up in our overwhelmed and under resourced hospitals. Tax payers will lose, cyclists will lose, drivers will lose and the only one who benefits will be Doug Ford who manages to convince a few voters that he is on their side. Shame on you\n"

There have been countless tax payer dollars spent on construction projects that will now be destroyed and there is no positive alternative other than \u201copening a lane or traffic\u201d. That is against the majority of worldwide research supporting alternative modes of transportation to ease traffic congestion and help the environment. With one bike lane you can have 10x the amount of people moving to their destination rather than blocking space with single occupancy vehicles.\nDoug Ford shame on you for destroying Ontario and not caring as long as it benefits you and your friends.\n"

        "comment": "The very premise of this bill is entirely, willfully, ignorant to the concept of induced demand, and to the facts and findings of every single study on the matter. The facts are simply that motor vehicles are the single least-efficient method by which to move people. Bike lanes can move far more people using far less space. Every city that has invested in bike lanes and public transportation have seen their traffic congestion decrease, and every city that has instead focused on providing more lanes for motor vehicles have seen those lanes quickly become congested. If you incentivize people to ride bikes and take streetcars and buses, by building bike lanes and leaving streets for streetcars and buses rather than motor vehicles, you can move far greater quantities of people faster, more efficiently, and taking up less space. If you incentivize them to drive, by taking away these options and instead offering them only more car lanes, they will choose to drive and very quickly congest those street lanes again. Cities simply contain far too many people in too dense of a space for cars to be an effective means of transportation. If you want to improve traffic congestion, the results of every single study are crystal clear: build more bike lanes and public transportation. Leave the streets for streetcars and buses.\n"

The province should be focused on improving road safety (which more bike lanes contribute to), encouraging environmentally friendly modes of transportation in this age of climate crisis, and supporting small businesses: per the below linked CBC article, according to a 2019 report looking at the impacts of bike lanes on a different stretch of Bloor Street, local businesses reported getting more customers since the lanes were installed!\n"

        "comment": "Protect Toronto\u2019s Existing Bike Lanes\nDear Province of Ontario,\nI am writing to express my deep concern over the proposal to limit or remove existing bike lanes in Toronto. As an avid cyclist who lives in the east end and relies on these lanes to safely commute to my job in healthcare on Hospital Row, they are an essential part of my daily life and that of many others in the city.\nBiking is not only efficient and environmentally friendly but also helps alleviate congestion. Each day, I share these lanes with countless other cyclists \u2013 a visible reminder of how vital they are in reducing gridlock. If we were all driving single-occupancy vehicles, it would only increase traffic and contribute to more emissions. I also own a car and do not feel that cyclists on Danforth, where there\u2019s a shared lane, impede my driving time; rather, they enhance the flow by keeping cars off the road.\nFor healthcare workers like myself, biking provides affordable, reliable transportation, especially for late shifts when public transit is not available. Driving downtown is often not a feasible alternative given the high parking costs and limited spaces, making bike lanes crucial for safe, accessible commuting.\nAdditionally, eliminating bike lanes may not even achieve the intended results: on any given day, I encounter vehicles unloading goods that temporarily block bike lanes. Removing bike lanes would only push these vehicles into the main traffic lanes, adding further obstacles for drivers without real benefit.\nBeyond practicality, biking is a joy and a way of connecting with our city. It\u2019s a positive, community-oriented alternative that encourages active transportation and benefits local businesses by reducing parking demand and increasing foot traffic.\nFor all of these reasons, I urge you to reconsider the plan and protect the bike lanes that Toronto residents have come to rely on and enjoy. They are essential to a more livable, sustainable city.\nThank you for your consideration.\nSincerely,\nAn avid Toronto cyclist/Healthcare worker\n"

The province should not be allowed to approve or deny changes to municipal roads, nor should it be allowed to make our streets less safe for cyclists by removing existing lanes.\nOntario needs more infrastructure for cyclists and pedestrians, NOT more infrastructure for cars.\nAs a person who owns a car, but also uses public transit and cycles depending on my destination, I am fully aware of the downfalls of each method. I also understand that travelling by car is a privilege that is not available to everyone, and therefore should not be the priority of any government.\nFor equality, we should be focusing on methods of transport that are available to ALL first and foremost.\nI strongly disagree with the content of this bill.\n"

It is not just to protect cyclists, but our population as a whole.\nIn an age where food delivery is common place, bike lanes provide an infrastructure to support that industry as well as many people who rely on bicycles as a means of income. To focus our transportation systems solely on cars is overly entitled and inconsiderate.\nAs a whole, proper cycling, infrastructure, only shows positive improvements. If on the other hand, we prioritize cars, we are opening the door to fatal pedestrian and cyclist accidents, increased air pollution and more gridlock.\nPlease keep and continue to improve Ontario cycling network.\n"

        "comment": "Hi,\nI would like to express that I oppose the Province's intervention in what I consider as municipal matters. I live in Swansea, directly south of the section of Bloor St. that the Premier references as an area where a recently implemented bike lane should be removed. I agree that vehicular congestion is an issue during peak hours, and is far from ideal, however I do not think the solution is to remove the bike lane. In fact the solution should be to encourage and support non-vehicular/car traffic to ease congestion, through better transit and safe routes for pedestrians and cyclists, which includes safe cross walks for pedestrians and bike lanes for cyclists.\nThanks,\nEvelyn\n"

        "comment": "I am strongly opposed to this legislation. Municipalities should have autonomy over city planning decisions including bike lanes. The province should be focused on strategies to actually reduce congestion - like public transit. A car is the worst way to get around and we should be building cities and towns (especially cities) that are walkable, bike able, and accessible by transit. Building cities around people, not cars, benefits everyone. Traffic congestion is reduced when more people walk, bike, and take transit to work. These are also better for the environment.\nStudies show that more available lanes of traffic actually increase congestion over time. I urge the province to look at the data and research and to make decisions based on facts, not on ideology or because of an unfair bias against cyclists. I am a health care worker in the province who rides my bike to and from work every day. I was hit by a driver earlier this year when I was following all rules of traffic - the driver was just not paying attention. As a cyclist, I am a vulnerable road user. We need to ensure our infrastructure supports *my* safety and the safety of other cyclists and pedestrians to prevent harm and death. We cannot compromise this for the convenience of drivers. It is morally wrong. I implore provincial lawmakers to withdraw this legislation in the name of safety and common sense.\n"

        "comment": "No evidence has proven that removing and/or limiting bike lanes will minimize gridlock. Decades of research have shown how induced demand has made gridlock even worse. To reduce gridlock, cities must provide people with more options to get where they need to go. These options include promoting active transportation such as adding cycling lanes, not removing them. From an equity perspective, this act does not consider the fact that there are thousands of Ontarians who rely on cycling infrastructure since they cannot afford a car or are unable to drive.\nThis act also puts the safety of cyclists in danger due to the lack of separation from cars. In the age of new mobility, the consensus among cities is that they must plan to move people, not cars. Not only does this way give people options for how they get around, but it also reduces demand for driving. However, this act is another example of how irresponsible this government is by ignoring modern-day planning practices and research, in favour of their political agenda. This over-step truly shows how irresponsible this government has been by moving forward their political agenda at the expense of Ontarians.\n"

        "comment": "\"Prescribed municipalities would be required to seek provincial approval to allow for the implementation of new bicycle lanes (\u201cbike lanes\u201d) that require the removal of an existing lane of traffic. Approval will be based on a set of specified criteria, to be set out in guidance and/or regulation.\"\nThe criteria, guidance, regulation should be determined by urban city planners that do not have a vested interested in political gain. Designing a city for the humans inside of it should not be determined by a policy analyst and approved by an Exec that sits in their concrete building, making over $100,000 a year, driving a fancy car, and shitting on cyclists because It is Fun to Hate People.\nThere is a way to balance a beautifully designed city that encourages economic growth, transportation of people and goods, encourages exercise (better health = fewer hospitalizations), and lower emissions, and still manages to make rich people rich. Hire some skilled URBAN DESIGNERS to design the regulations. DO NOT leave it up to the idiots that are the little brother of Paul that runs the construction business that will benefit from destroying community infrastructure.\nI do not understand why Ontario tries so hard to be a place devoid of humanity. If you want business, be an attractive location. An attractive location has cool businesses, great multi-functional methods to access businesses and community areas.\n"
