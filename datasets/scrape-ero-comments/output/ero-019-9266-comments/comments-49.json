As a driver, cyclist, and father of four active children, who we have taught to cycle safely in the city, putting additional regulatory hurdles in place in order to create bike lanes in our city will put my children and me at additional risk. We need to make it easier for municipalities to create bike lanes, not harder.\nThe evidence clearly shows bike lanes keep commuters safer and encourage more people to ride bikes. All while adding seconds to drivers\u2019 commutes. Yes, Toronto\u2019s gridlock situation is dire. But this is not the solution.\nThis seems like a petty and cynical attempt to win votes by Premier Ford. Please do not move forward with this antisocial and nonsensical motion.\n"

By giving residents safe options for cycling, we decrease reliance on cars, ultimately easing gridlock over time. In addition, bike lanes promote public health by encouraging physical activity and reducing stress related to traffic. Restricting municipal authority undermines local efforts to create sustainable, healthy cities.\nMunicipal governments should have the autonomy to install bike lanes where needed, without unnecessary provincial barriers.\n"

Most people stuck in traffic are drivers who don't live in the city of Toronto. Bike lanes move more people than cars on aggregate. There are no studies that prove that adding more lanes eases congestion.\nBike lanes have a greater passenger capacity than lanes for vehicular traffic. The average single lane of private motor-vehicle traffic has a capacity of between 600 and 900 vehicles per hour, representing between 600 and 1,800 people (and it\u2019s closer to the lower end of that range because most cars have but a single occupant).\nBy contrast, the average two-way protected bike lane (which typically occupies less space than a single lane of traffic), has a capacity of 7,500 people per hour.\nhttps://www.tvo.org/article/debunking-three-big-myths-about-bike-lanes\nStop with your government overreach.\n"

And if they do want to meddle, why not interfere in demanding more on an issue that is having huge impacts on the province - housing.\nBike infrastructure take people off the road and increases safety for everyone - yes even cars.\nThe cities that have included bike lanes in their planning recognize the need to transform we have traditionally moved people from place to place and should be rewarded with even more bike lane projects. As a young person in this province, these steps to stop a clearly beneficial trend in our cities by the province make me lose hope in our leadership and the people that continue to undermine progress in the name of dumb politics.\n"

I don't support making huge changes like this without actual study and research being done.\nI also question the validity of the go's of this bill for streets with 2-4 lanes of traffic going in either direction. Typically, cars are parked (legally or illegally) in the right lane, so removing a bike lane in many situations won't make a difference.\nWhat we will end up with are fewer people getting to where they need to go, and mounting frustration towards the government that made the change. I don't think this bill is well thought out unless you're trying to achieve something completely different that you haven't shared with the public.\nMy next concern is the what will now be wasted money that went into revamping streets with bike lanes. I don't see value in cities getting that money back from the Ontario government when the bike lanes have been providing value already.\nI summary, the decision is premature and poorly planned, and toying with taxpayers' money is irresponsible.\nThank you for reading my feedback.\n"

I use my car frequently when I need to run errands or leave the city, otherwise I use my bike about 80% of the time to travel within the city. To work, to meet friends and for leisure. I love riding my bike. The bike lane network in Toronto and around the province is growing. I use the bike network in Toronto everyday, including the GREAT new lanes on University. The bike network is integral to keeping the city moving, reducing it would only make things worse with short term construction to rip them out and overall more car lanes = more traffic. I do not support Doug Fords Conversatives to remove bike lanes. This is unsafe, as it will not remove the amount of people who bike, it will only make them bike on the road with vehicular traffic - slowing more cars down and increasing the risk of accident.\nBike lanes save lives and help people move around the city.\nIf Doug Ford was really concerned about traffic he would ban on street parking on these busy streets and not have patios on the streets all summer. I\u2019m not sure how bike lanes contribute more traffic than these.\nAll to be said I can\u2019t say enough how much I do not support this motion. It\u2019s a distraction for the other things this government is mismanaging or flat out lying about. What are you distracting us from Doug?\n"

        "comment": "Hi Minister,\nRevoke Bill 212. It is a huge overstep by the provincial government to interfere with municipal governing of bike lanes. These roads come under the jurisdiction of municipal governments.\nI refuse to vote for the Conservative Party in the next election because of this huge breach of democracy.\nThe bill is allegedly intended to reduce traffic congestion by reviewing and removing bike lanes, however this is not backed by data; in fact the data shows the exact opposite: introducing bike lanes has a huge benefit to the community, increases safety for all road users, and increases speed for short term trips.\nAs a Toronto citizen I will focus on my city, however evidence shows that bike lanes provide the following benefits:\nEMS vehicles are not delayed by bike lanes in getting folks to emergency rooms as confirmed by the City of Toronto\u2019s EMS leads.\nThere is not a petition of 50,000 people against the bike lanes on Bloor. It\u2019s more like 13,000 who\u2019ve signed over several years now and Cycle Toronto\u2019s petition in support of bike lanes is approaching that number in just weeks.\nBike lanes are good for business! They boost sales in areas they are installed, attract higher spending clientele, can increase property values, and even attract talented work forces.\nBike lanes do not increase congestion, they move people around more efficiently, create safer driving routes (less collisions, less congestion), and get people out of single occupancy motor vehicle, which actually are the cause of congestion.\nSide streets are not the answer. Unconnected segments of bike lanes that force cyclists to take circuitous routes on various side streets will not encourage people to get out of their cars and onto bikes.\nIf you care about congestion, revoke bill 212. This bill is a dog whistle to your voter base who for inexplicable reasons have decided bike lanes are the root of all evil, and this bill is deplorable.\n"

        "comment": "This bill undermines local democracy and will put lives at risk. Bike lanes are an essential part of transportation routes in safe, clean neighbourhoods, which reduce congestion, not add to it.\nMunicipalities should have the ability to improve transportation routes in ways that make sense for their communities, in consultation with the people who live in them. Giving this power to the provincial government is government overreach and adds more red tape to city improvement initiatives. It undermines democracy in our communities.\nBike lanes are essential to keeping cyclists safe on the road. Many cyclists are children, families, and young people. Their lives are put at risk without bike lanes. Prioritizing cars at the expense of the safety of cyclists is wrong. My 29-year-old brother died while cycling to work\u2014a bike lane would have saved his life.\nCycling improves people\u2019s health, and gets people out of cars, reducing pollution and gridlock. This government should be finding ways to get more people out of their cars and on to public transit, walking, and cycling instead of focusing on cars. The climate crisis is real. Once you realize that and start acting accordingly, you\u2019ll have a chance to be on the right side of history. If you don\u2019t, there may not be any more history.\nThis bill is wrongheaded and will cost people\u2019s lives in the short and long terms.\n"

        "comment": "I am deeply concerned with this proposed legislation, and sincerely hope the government reconsiders it. This is not an exhaustive list, but here are some reasons:\n1.\u2060 \u2060I live near Bloor Street West, and as a pedestrian I feel significantly safer on the street since the bike lanes were installed (all three phases). The bike lanes also make the street feel more community-oriented, improving sidewalk feel.\n2.\u2060 \u2060I am afraid for the safety of bike-riders. I remember before the bike lanes were installed, there were only a few riders along Bloor, but now the bike lanes are congested every morning, with lineups at signalled intersections as numerous as cars. These people have built their lives around the infrastructure, and will likely continue to bike, but this bill will make it more dangerous for them.\nThis has been the deadliest year in Toronto for bike-riders, with 6 people killed, and the people who would be most affected are some out of province\u2019s most vulnerable workers: the gig-economy food delivery riders. I would hope the government would encourage further safety measures, rather than remove them.\n3.\u2060 \u2060I have had the privilege of living in other cities both within and outside Canada, and can attest to how a mature cycling network works to relieve traffic congestion. There are hundreds of studies to support it, but having lived in it, I can tell you that once the network is vast enough to connect to enough amenities, people begin to use it more often, leaving space in the car lanes for those who have fewer options. It\u2019s a win-win, but it requires patience and investment.\n4.\u2060 \u2060It is a waste of my, a humble tax-payer this government pretends to care about, taxes. I am confident that when the government changes, whether that\u2019s in 1,2, or 6 years, that the routes removed will be reinstalled, and we will have paid for their installation twice (and their removal). The whole world is moving towards encouraging active transportation to mitigate climate change, congestion, and obesity, and bike lanes make it safer and more convenient for cyclists and\u2014crucially\u2014to get around their communities. Ontario and Toronto are not unique; this infrastructure is popular worldwide, and road users will and already demand them. I do not understand why this government would waste my taxes on demolishing this crucial infrastructure.\n5.\u2060 \u2060I believe municipal governments should be trusted to make decisions about their road infrastructure without interference from the province. I believe firmly in the intimate democratic process at city halls, and feel that these matters are local ones. The legislation promises to make these decisions more expensive, more prone to unnecessary delays, and I fear, much less likely to be green-lit.\n6.\u2060 \u2060Bike lanes are not the cause of congestion, and removing or limiting serves no benefit! This legislation will invite only more cars to the road, further clogging up the roads which already have capacity issues, and have no room to grow without demolishing the liveability of our neighbourhoods. You cannot solve cars with cars\u2014this province needs to embrace and invest in other transportation modes to reduce congestion, and a mature network of bike lanes are an important piece, alongside well-funded public transit.\n7. I am disappointed that the provincial government is spending their time and efforts meddling in municipal business, obliterating the democratic will of the residents on the very streets this bill will affect. Furthermore, this is an undermining of the work of experts and local leaders who worked tirelessly for decades to get these bike lanes approved and installed, with many, many rounds of public consultation involved with every step. The provincial government butting in like this is undemocratic, unsafe, and ignores the wishes of the people who live in the nighbourhoods these streets are in. Drivers pass through these areas. I actually live here. Please consider those outside of motor vehicles.\nThank you for taking the time to consider my response to this legislation. I am deeply disappointed in the government\u2019s logic in introducing this bill, and hope it will reconsider it before bringing it to a vote.\n"

By investing in bike lanes and other sustainable transportation options, Ontario can reduce gridlock, promote active transportation, and create healthier and more vibrant communities.\nIn conclusion, Ontario's Bill 212 - reducing gridlock should prioritize the expansion and improvement of bike lanes as a critical strategy for addressing traffic congestion. The importance of bike lanes cannot be overstated, as they provide a safe and dedicated space for cyclists, encourage more people to choose cycling over driving, and contribute to cities' overall sustainability and livability. There are more viable solutions to reducing traffic congestion than removing bike lanes. Instead, a comprehensive approach to traffic management that includes bike lanes and other sustainable transportation options should be pursued.\n"

Imagine the road congestion if every 16+ yrs old person needs a car. It is in the province's best interest to not force those potential bike riders to get into debt to buy cars because they dont have other ways to move around more efficiently (not everyone has a bus / train nearby or within their direct route) and thus avoiding further congestion. Municipalities are the ones that know their people, and where they move and want to go. It makes no sense for the province to be determining bike lanes for all towns /cities, unless those are inter-cities bike connections.
