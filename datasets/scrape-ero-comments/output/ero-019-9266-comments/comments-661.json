        "comment": "Please do not move forward with Bill 212. I am a graduate student at the University of Toronto and I live in the Bloorcourt neighbourhood. The easiest and most affordable for me to get to school each day is to bike using the bike lane on Bloor Street. I am very grateful for this infrastructure because it makes my commute way safer. I encounter many other people using the bike lane every morning and evening. Often, parents will have their young children on the bikes with them.\nWhen I have to bike on streets that do not have bike lanes, like College Street I feel very on edge and unsafe which adds unneeded stress to my day.\nBike lanes create a fair separation between cars and bikes and I feel that drivers are more aware of me when I am in a bike lane. I believe that removing the bike lane will increase traffic as more people will need to rely on cars to get to where they're going. Also, having cars and bikes in the same areas creates unneeded congestion because a bike goes slower that traffic, so when bikes are forced to go into car lanes the whole system slows down. I have also been told many horror stories of bikers being killed by vehicles when biking on roads that do not have bike lanes.\nRemoving already existing bicycle infrastructure is a complete waste of tax payer money, and will not speed up driving times because of the bikers that will be forced into taking up a lane to bike safely to where they're going. Thank you for reading my comment and I sincerely hope that you will preserve the bike lanes that make biking in Toronto possible.\n"

        "comment": "I am a Toronto resident and I am writing to express my concerns for Bill 212.\nThe solution to congestion in Ontario is not removing bike lanes in Toronto. Bike lanes in Toronto have nothing to do with provincial flow of traffic and in fact removing them will pose a risk to both drivers and bikers. The Bill also proposes the building of highway 413 through the Greenbelt to alleviate congestion, but the 407 is already an existing and underused highway that needs to be addressed first before spending billions to pave way for another highway that will likely be tolled with the proposal for broadband internet. We need another solution for density in our province.\nImpact of Bike Lanes\nThe province is overstepping its jurisdiction by proposing Bill 212 to remove and assess every bike lane in the city of Toronto. Bike lanes are a matter for municipalities, not provinces. The bike lane across the city, especially the ones on University, Bloor and Yonge are keeping both drivers and bikers safe. I am a driver in the city and wouldn't feel safe without dedicated and protected bike lanes to separate bikers from drivers. Our city also depends on delivery bikers to deliver our foods and goods. This demand for food delivery will not stop because there are no more bike lanes, in fact what is likely to happen is an increase in collisions and fatalities as all road users try to negotiate unclear roads. Removing bike lanes in the city will push our city back decades in creating infrastructure for all. Cities across North America like Montreal, Vancouver, Ottawa, Halifax, Saskatoon, New York, Washington, San Francisco, Chicago and many more have extensive bike networks that allow residents to unlock the full potential of their cities.\nImpact of Highway 413\nThe solution to congestion is not a new highway which extensive research by experts has shown will increase congestion even more. Research indicates that expanding road capacity often leads to induced demand,  where increased roadway space attracts more drivers, eventually resulting in congestion levels similar to those before expansion. Experts like Matthew Turner, a professor of economics at Brown University, emphasize that expanding road capacity without considering induced demand overlooks historical patterns of traffic behaviour. Turner notes that building more highways has consistently failed to alleviate congestion in the long term. To effectively address traffic congestion, experts advocate for a multifaceted approach that includes investments in public transit like high speed trains, development of cycling infrastructure, and implementation of policies that encourage alternative modes of transportation.\nThere is already an existing and underused highway: the 407. Why is broadband internet needed for this proposed highway if it\u2019s not intended to be used for tolls? If the province is planning on tolling highway 413, it would likely be significantly underused just like the 407. The proposed bill also wants an exemption from the Environmental Assessment Act - why? These environmental acts exist  to assess the potential environmental effects before a project begins. Building a new highway through the Greenbelt will not alleviate congestion in Ontario and in fact could cause more congestion by incentivising people to use their cars more. . Great case studies are cities like\nWe need better infrastructure that can manage the density of our province for years to come, not short term solutions like highway 413 and removing bike lanes in Toronto.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is a gross overstep of provincial power. Bike lanes are a municipal issue and affect the residents of the city they are implemented in. Suburbanites should not take priority to those who actually live in the city. Bike lanes are VITAL to reducing congestion. Providing alternatives to driving is, i.e. biking, is what actually gets people out of congestion. It should be a good thing to see cyclists passing traffic because that means there is a viable alternative to driving and those who don't need to drive may choose a different method. There is NO possible way to have EVERYONE on the road in cars and somehow not have congestion, the only way is encourage different modes of transportation, i.e. bike lanes. On street parking is a much bigger waste of space than functioning bike lanes. Bike lanes are functional, and healthy and good for the city.\nIf the province actually cared about reducing congestion, they would create a comprehensive network of bike lanes that are safe and maintained instead of ripping them out. But in the end this is a municipal issue that the province should NOT have control over.\nFrom every angle bike lanes are a good thing. Getting rid of them would be a huge step backwards, therefore they should not be under the jurisdiction of the province.\n"

While I understand the importance of infrastructure development, I believe the approach outlined in the bill raises significant concerns.\nFirstly, the expanded powers for expropriation without sufficient public consultation, as described in the Building Broadband Faster Act, 2021 and the Building Highways Faster Act, 2024, undermine landowners' rights and due process. Stripping protections such as hearings of necessity fails to balance infrastructure needs with community impacts.\nSecondly, the amendments to the Highway Traffic Act that restrict municipal authority over bike lane projects are a step backward for sustainable urban planning. Removing or limiting bike lanes compromises efforts to reduce emissions and promote safe, active transportation for residents.\nI urge the government to reconsider these provisions and ensure that infrastructure projects prioritize environmental stewardship, community input, and fairness.\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\n"

Our transit system cannot accommodate everyone who would ride it if it were more convenient.\nSafe bike lanes remove cars from the roads, significantly reducing traffic.  The appeal to people who reject bike lanes only serves the self-indulgence of those who can afford a car.  Removing bike lanes actually increases their commute times in most cases.\nThis is in addition to the environmental problems when downtowns are clogged with traffic.

I don't even live in Toronto and I think this is a ridiculous waste of taxpayer money and a total overreach of the Doug Ford government. I voted for Ford in the last election because he promised Red Tape Reduction, but here he is now, wasting time and MY non-Toronto money on Toronto issues so that his commute will be shorter.\nI also don't want to share the lane with bikes when I drive! The fact that this bill applies to ALL cities in Ontario means that my city will also stop moving cyclists into their own lane. I want cyclists OFF the road. I understand some people need to bike because they are poor or enjoy fitness. It is more dangerous and stressful to have to follow a bicycle moving slowly in my lane, versus the cyclists having their own lane. I don't understand why Doug Ford and Minister Sarkaria think that mixing cyclists into the driving lanes will make traffic move faster!\nOverall, this is a very disappointing step for a conservative government. I want to see smaller government focused on the issues that matter to all Ontario residents, not $50 million dollar pet projects on the Premier's commute. My commute has also gotten longer and more congested, but no one is spending $50 million dollars to help ME.\nThank you.\n"

It\u2019s been and still is my main means of getting around. About eight years ago, when I was approaching 80 and we were downsizing, I thought of giving up cycling.\nI decided not to in part because the City of Toronto was becoming serious about providing good facilities for cyclists. The bike lane in front the apartment we moved into is among the best in the world, and I\u2019ve seen very many while travelling and working on five continents. Now, perhaps two thirds of my bike riding is on good bike lanes, most occupying a sliver of the width of major roads.\nIf these bike lanes are removed, I\u2019ll stop cycling. The sidewalks are becoming more hazardous for elderly people. I feel safer on my bike in a bike lane than when walking on an uneven sidewalk. Transit has become unreliable. I\u2019ll stay at home more. I\u2019ll become less healthy, and I\u2019m of an age when getting sick costs the community a lot.\nYou may think I\u2019m too old to be riding a bike. But I see many of my age in the bike lanes. I  see children too, in a safer space for their bike riding than on the sidewalk or the regular pavement.\nAnd I\u2019m not even touching on the absurdity of a provincial government obsessing about bike lanes when there are evident major challenges in almost everything in Ontario a provincial government is normally concerned about.\n"

        "comment": "I am not a cyclist, but I am OPPOSED to the proposed Bill 212. The proposed bill is irresponsible, out of touch, and harmful to all, including drivers.\nLet me tell you why. When I was in university, I once used a friend\u2019s bike to ride to school. Because I was learning to drive at the time, I knew I was supposed to use the road. I had been riding bikes on lanes so I thought I would do fine, but no, the entire trip was terrifying. I was constantly feeling I would be hit by cars. The trauma was so great I have not used the bike ever since, not even today.\nA few years ago, I was downtown in Toronto, right near a major intersection, near Bay and Dundas, and I witnessed a bike being hit by a car. The person on the bike was literally flown into the air by about three metres.\nA few weeks ago, during my usual bus trip in uptown Toronto, a bus had to slow down because a bike was on the road. Any driver would have encountered this scenario many many times.\nBikes are unsafe on roads and slow down cars. That\u2019s why people ride on sidewalks, but bikes on sidewalks pose danger to pedestrians.\nThere\u2019s an easy solution to this problem: Bike lanes, so that pedestrians can feel safe, and ideally well-separated bike lanes so that cyclists will not feel danger from cars. And with bike lanes cars won\u2019t have to constantly slow down because, obviously, bikes are slower than cars.\nFor a government that shuts down the Ontario Science Centre when it posed no imminent danger, it\u2019s unconceivable it would table a bill that will pose immediate danger to pedestrians, cyclists and drivers alike. Bill 212 is completely irresponsible.\nCars are being slowed down because bike lanes are disjoint. People are using bike lanes less than during COVID because people worry about being hit by cars. Instead of shutting down bike lanes,  more bike lanes should be built so that they are continuous. THAT will make traffic go smoother.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to the province's proposed plan to limit the construction of bike lanes in municipalities across Ontario. This decision is not just short-sighted; it undermines the very foundations of effective urban planning and the pressing need for sustainable transportation solutions.\nFirstly, and from a legislative perspective, requiring provincial approval for bike lanes is an overreach into municipal jurisdiction. Drawing on local expertise and community feedback, municipalities create transportation plans that effectively balance traffic management with key priorities such as active transportation, multimodal transit options, and environmental protection. It remains unclear how the Ministry of Transportation can make more informed decisions about local transportation issues than the municipalities themselves. Instead of micromanaging bicycle lane implementation, the Ministry could better support the development of new housing by streamlining its own approval processes.\nAs for the impact of bike lanes, evidence consistently demonstrates that bike lanes significantly reduce gridlock and greenhouse gas emissions while enhancing overall traffic flow. In a time when many residents are grappling with the rising cost of living, bike lanes are vital for those relying on affordable transportation options, including delivery drivers and individuals without vehicle access. Limiting this infrastructure would not only ignore the needs of these residents but also exacerbate existing inequalities in transportation access.\nTraffic congestion is a self-perpetuating problem; more cars lead to more gridlock. Expanding bike lanes offers a viable solution by encouraging alternative modes of transport and alleviating congestion. This is essential for the health and safety of our communities, as well as for combating climate change. The failure to invest in safe and accessible cycling infrastructure demonstrates a lack of vision and leadership in addressing urban challenges.\nClaims that bike lanes hinder emergency response are unfounded. The City of Toronto has stated that emergency services are fully capable of navigating existing cycling infrastructure, debunking the notion that bike lanes contribute to delays. In contrast, restricting bike lanes will directly endanger lives, particularly vulnerable road users, and impede the transformative projects outlined in Toronto's approved plan to add 100 kilometres of bike lanes over the next three years.\nWe need a government that prioritizes evidence-based decision-making rather than succumbing to political pressures that distract from the real issues at hand. The proposed legislation risks not only the progress made in Toronto, but also undermines efforts across the province to create affordable and accessible cities.\nI urge you to reconsider this plan and stand for a vision of a city that embraces sustainable transportation options, prioritizing the well-being of its residents and the environment. The province must respect local decision-making when considering transportation planning.\n"

        "comment": "Hello and thank you for the opportunity to provide feedback on this proposal.\nOf the 4 priorities our government has identified, I am only in agreement with the third, specifically, \"speeding up the delivery of broadband projects that will connect people in all parts of Ontario, including rural areas, with reliable internet access.\" In the 21st century, access to online services is essential for all people.\nWhere the other three priorities are concerned, I am in complete disagreement -- especially with:\n- ...the need to build priority highways faster as our province grows in order to get people and goods out of gridlock and save drivers and businesses time and money.\"\n- ...building Highway 413, recognizing the importance of this highway to millions of drivers from across Ontario.\"\nWe DO NOT need more highways. The proposal to subsidize Highway 407 for trucks rather than build an adjacent roadway/tunnel at the taxpayers' expense -- for the second time -- is far more reasonable and will facilitate the shipment of goods efficiently, freeing up Highway 401 for drivers. Moreover, the people who use the roads should pay for them. Toll roads exist all over the world and across the US, and should be implemented more widely here in Ontario and Canada.\nWe DO need to increase accessible public transportation across the province. This means buses and/or trains. I was just visiting friends in the North Bay area last week and learned of the utter lack of transportation options for cancer patients commuting to Princess Margaret Hospital for treatments. They simply should not have to drive. Ours is a large province and to rely solely on cars to travel to and from our various centres in the year 2024 is unreasonable.\nWe DO need to open and operate the Eglinton Crosstown. As a publicly funded transit line (i.e., one paid for by the taxpayers) there should be complete transparency around the deadline for its completion. This is particularly noteworthy given the disruption the construction of the Ontario Line is currently causing to so many Toronto taxpayers. To commence an expansive project without demonstrating the capacity to complete another, is just bad practice and bad PR. Why should we have any confidence that Metrolinx can build the (much-needed) Ontario relief line, when it can't complete the Crosstown LRT on budget and on time?\nNot only should Metrolinx be more accountable and efficient, it should offer more affordable fares to encourage publicly funded transit options -- for example, its GO fares to and from the GTA. This would be much more cost-effective than building an entirely new highway to accommodate more cars in this time of climate change when we must cut our carbon emissions.\nTo this end, the construction and use of bike lanes is forward-looking. We need and SHOULD NOT eliminate bike lanes. They contribute to the livability of our city. Without them, the streets and sidewalks will become overwhelmed with e-scooters, e-bikes and e-couriers -- many of whom are currently making our bike lanes unsafe, because they do not follow the rules of the road: they ride without lights; they do not use bells; they do not stop at intersections; they jump on and off sidewalks.  Should the provincial government eliminate bike lanes, they will bring this behaviour onto our roads, wreaking havoc and confusion in traffic.\nAs a point of fact, city bike lanes are the municipal government's purview to manage. Toronto City Council is better positioned and more knowledgeable about the needs of its constituents. The provincial government should focus its attention on efficient transit options to and from our provincial centres, and not within them.\nRather than eliminating bike lanes, we should plan development/construction projects strategically. Multiple arteries (east/west and north/south) should not be dug up at once. Infrastructure projects are crucial, but require careful and strategic scheduling. We should also consider restricting driving in parts of the city, as they have done in Time Square in New York City and London UK's Congestion Zone; and consider implementing one-way streets like those in Manhattan.\nIn summary, poor planning, incomplete transit projects, and unaffordable bus and/or train commuting options are causing gridlock. As Mayor Chow has pointed out, if we were to build more highways around the GTA, their construction will cause even longer commuting times.\nInstead of the priorities set out in Bill 212, we should:\n- Implement tolls for commuters who do not pay taxes in Toronto but benefit from all the benefits the city has to offer (i.e. employment, entertainment, hospitality);\n- Increase affordable transit options within Toronto (like the Eglinton Crosstown LRT) AND across the province with Metrolinx systems (e.g. GO Trains & Buses);\n- Properly manage Metrolinx and development projects so they are planned/scheduled strategically, and consider alternate traffic patterns within the city to keep traffic moving;\n- MAINTAIN existing bike lanes, so that roads can be free of bikes, scooters, e-bikes and e-scooters.\nI am a longstanding city resident, driver, transit user, taxpayer, cyclist and active participant in our urban community. My government's disregard for this country's largest city -- its livability, its affordability -- is heart-breaking, and astonishingly irresponsible. This poorly conceived Bill 212 is both an enormous disappointment and a wasteful proposal of public spending.\nThank you.\nAV\n"
