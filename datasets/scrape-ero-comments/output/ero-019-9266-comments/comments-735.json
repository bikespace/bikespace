        "comment": "As a long time supporter of the PC, I can say this is right up there with one of the most ridiculous ideas. You should be promoting other methods of travel rather than looking at gasers as the main focus. Focus on public transit and think outside of the box. Look at smaller footprint vehicles like scooters, mopeds and get with the times. We have some great options for e-bikes that can easily meet the road worthy criteria with mirrors, lights, turn signals and a horn such as Surron ebikes. I'd leave my truck at home and make use of this if I could legally drive it on public roads. It's crazy to think we are shunning new technology when there is little difference between this and something like a Honda ct125 that can be plated.\n"

Although they may at times slow traffic, their benefits far outweigh this potential drawback, including protecting vulnerable road users\u2019 lives, reducing emissions, improving health, and promoting local shopping and community engagement. Removing bike lanes will not solve Toronto\u2019s traffic problems, nor will it take cyclists off the road\u2014drivers will have to contend more with sharing lanes with cyclists and as studies have shown, more road space for cars often leads to more cars using that space, not better traffic flow. Why should drivers always have the priority in our lawmaking, especially when cars have such a negative impact on the environment? Cyclists are commuters and people with families, too. We deserve safe road space. I value bike lanes for my family and they are part of what makes Toronto a great city to live in.  Removing them would have severe negative consequences for citizens and nature.\n"

        "comment": "As a cyclist and parent of two children in Toronto, I\u2019ve seen firsthand how vital our municipal bike lanes are for the safety and well-being of cyclists, pedestrians, and even drivers. These lanes provide a protected space that helps reduce accidents, encourages more people to bike, and contributes to cleaner air by reducing car dependence. The Ontario government's interference in these lanes could undo years of progress we\u2019ve made in creating a safer, more sustainable city.\nToronto\u2019s bike lanes are designed based on local needs and expertise, taking into account the unique layout and congestion of our streets. Provincial interference risks imposing one-size-fits-all solutions that may not be suited for the diverse neighborhoods and cycling conditions here. Moreover, the city has a clear mandate to prioritize sustainable transportation options, and removing or reducing bike lanes would undermine that goal.\nThere\u2019s also the issue of induced demand\u2014an economic principle that suggests building more vehicle lanes to alleviate traffic actually leads to more cars on the road, worsening congestion over time. Studies from cities like Vancouver and New York show that expanding roads can temporarily reduce traffic, but it encourages more people to drive, eventually leading to even worse gridlock. Instead of building more lanes for cars, we should be investing in infrastructure that encourages alternatives like cycling, which can help reduce traffic congestion and improve quality of life for everyone.\nCycling is a key part of the solution to Toronto\u2019s traffic congestion and environmental issues. The city's efforts to expand bike lanes have made cycling more accessible and less intimidating, especially for newcomers or those who are less experienced. We need the Ontario government to support Toronto's bike infrastructure decisions, not interfere with them. After all, no one understands Toronto's cycling needs better than the people who live and bike here.\n"

        "comment": "I am opposed to almost all of this bill.\nWe can start with schedule 4. Preventing bike lane construction, and taking away the ability of local government to build bike lanes where needed, takes away individual freedom by removing and reducing an option for safe local travel. Provincial government is simply too large and too far removed from the local level to make decisions on bike lanes across the province. No planners, and indeed no data I'm aware of from anywhere in the world, support avoiding construction of or the removal of bike lanes as a way to improve traffic, the ostensible reason for this part of the bill.\nSchedule 3 speeds up the process of assessment, taking away from the public the time to become familiar with and see the results of assessments. Especially for such large and expensive projects, the public deserves a chance to learn and see the assessments in order to form an opinion and discuss it with their MP.\nSchedule 2 takes away more rights and freedoms from citizens. Rather than any ability to have individual circumstances reviewed and involve a judge to evaluate those circumstances, it allows the bureaucracy of the provincial government to dictate what people must do and when they must leave their property with no respect for the individual.\nBesides all this bill does to remove existing rights and freedoms from citizens, my view at this point is that highway 413 in particular does not have enough net public benefit to be justified. Using schedule 3 to start the process before full assessment is done suggests the current government values completing the project over all else, but they should be concerned about overall value to the public. In other words, bill 212 is simply helping to support wasteful spending.\n"

For many, biking is their only choice of getting around - it\u2019s cheap and efficient, and owning a car comes with huge costs. In many cases, biking is faster and more reliable than the ttc.\nFor citizens who choose to bike, we deserve safe infrastructure! The city cannot only cater to drivers! Where there is travel demand for biking, bike lanes should remain in place. A simple glance at Bloor, University, and other major arteries shows that they are heavily used - more bikes pass by than cars in the summer!\nReducing congestion in a city as massive as Toronto doesn\u2019t mean getting rid of bikers - it means making alternatives to driving as accessible and convenient as possible. The density of the downtown core simply cannot accommodate enough vehicles if everyone chooses to drive, and getting rid of bike lanes won\u2019t change that!\nFinally, bike lanes should be a municipal choice - it is in Toronto\u2019s backyard and should be chosen by Torontonians, NOT the provincial government!\n"

Since it plays a vital role in my daily routine, my social life, and my friends' social life, it has a huge impact on the quality of our lives. We have our biking community which means a sense of community we share and social events we attend.\nI will not be able to use the bus or Uber, or I cannot drive because I do not have a car. Because I care about my health, fitness, time, and the life quality of where I live. I care about the planet that I live on and I want to keep Waterloo as green and clean as possible.\nI cannot imagine Waterloo without its bike lanes because I do not want to live in a city like Toronto. That simply means that I do not like air pollution, noise pollution, constant stress of getting to work, road raging at other citizens, wasting my time in traffic, and wasting my money on other modes of transportation.\nGiven all that, instead of wasting taxpayer dollars by adding red tape and bureaucracy, the government should invest in constructing more bike lanes so that cyclists are able to bike safely in rainy and snowy days of Winter. That should be our next project.\nIs it not the 21st century? Is it not time to move forward instead of backward? Have we not caused enough exploitation and violation? Why can we not think less about exploiting each other?\n"

        "comment": "Ontario is heavily lacking in its infrastructure for non-car transportation. The removal of bike lanes will further exacerbate this issue.\nBiking would be the best mode of transportation for my daily commutes, as it's faster than walking or public transportation but more flexible than cars (especially for those who live in a single-car household). However, the lack of proper biking infrastructure around the GTA makes biking a less safe option.\nThough few, the existing bike lanes are often unprotected, used for car parking , and inconsistent. Removing these lanes will not address these issues. Instead, it will force bikers to share lanes with cars, increasing the risk of accidents. Removing bike lanes means reducing the number of people using this mode of transportation, as we don't want to be maimed by the vehicles we are forced to share lanes with.\nEven as a driver, the removal of these lanes is not beneficial. Moving bikers off their designated lanes and into driving lanes would only cause more accidents and traffic. Even making a road completely unbikeable will not resolve our traffic issues. Traffic is caused by too many cars on the road. Forcing more people to drive will create more traffic.\nOn roads without bike lanes, there is still traffic.\nOn roads without bikes, there is still traffic.\nWe can not keep scapegoating other modes of transportation in pursuit of a car-centered infrastructure. The removal of non-car infrastructure in the USA and other car-centric regions has led to a rise in car usage, traffic, and accidents. I do not believe it is wise for Ontario to blindly follow a path proven to be destructive.\nWe need to provide options for those who prefer not to drive so that drivers can use the roads more freely.\n"

        "comment": "1. The bike lane on Bloor Street is an important laneway and path for cyclists. Many people, use it everyday to get to work to commute downtown for work. The removal of this lane wouldn't necessarily help the flow of vehicular traffic as the amount of space the bike lanes take up is not large enough as a second lane.\n2. Bike lanes create accessible modes of transport for people who also would like access to businesses along this street. The Toronto BIA has stated that removing them would hurt businesses.\n3. The statistics reveal that bike lanes do not actually cause more traffic. That is a simple correlation that is misguided. What increases more traffic is an increase in the City's population. In fact, City's across the world have said that by building more bike lanes, more people are likely to use this as a mode of transportation. Complaining about bike congestion is less likely to occur than vehicular traffic congestion.\n4. Bike lanes also decrease the speed of cars on roads, making these streets safer for all including pedestrians.\n5. Building Highway 413 will destroy the already dwindling environmental habitats of this province and that there are existing highways which can be used as alternatives to help increase the flow of traffic (make them toll free). Part of good design is to utilize what is already existing. With climate change consistently affecting all parts of our lives (including the economy) we need better commitments from our Government officials in reducing the number of new builds and utilizing what we currently have. There are plenty of unused spaces and places that can be used to solve issues that we are currently facing now. With a shift in perspective and innovation this can be achieved.\n"

        "comment": "Dear cyclists,\nA challenge for you.\u00a0\nBut first, a confession.\nI'm giving up the bike. After two decades of commuting on two wheels, I've determined it's time to exercise my prerogative as an Ontarian.\nI'm getting a car.\nNow, before you flip me off for changing lanes, hear me out.\nFor starters, we cyclists have been missing out on the savings afforded to car users in this province. Not only has Premier Ford generously eliminated licence plate renewal fees, he also plans to extend\u200a-\u200afor a third time\u200a-\u200aa tax rebate at the pumps.\nThese reductions, Finance Minister Bethlenfalvy reminds us, are the government's way of \"helping to keep costs down for the people of Ontario.\"\u00a0\nBy 'people,' of course, he doesn't mean you. He means the people with cars. He means the people of Ontario.\nPerhaps you're thinking: 'But I save thousands a year by foregoing insurance premiums and parking costs and maintenance fees. And I never buy gas.'\nI wouldn't be so smug. You'll soon be made to direct some of those savings toward cost of the much-needed improvements outlined in Bill 212, Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act. This long-overdue bill will earmark even more of your income\u200a-\u200ato the tune of tens of millions of dollars, by one recent estimate\u200a-\u200ato delete bikes lanes from GTA streets.\nThen there's the six billion dollar price tag for the proposed highway 413. Perhaps you're wondering: Does Ontario need yet another highway? One that will cost over $1,000 per Ontarian? One that will raze ecologically sensitive wetlands in order to save, at best, minutes to the commutes of a minority of Ontarians?\nI used to ask those kinds of questions, too. Then I decided to get a car.\nSee, if you, like me, warmed to the dictum of 'four wheels good, two wheels bad', you might come to appreciate how, though these figures seem exorbitant\u200a-\u200aan amount of money that could, say, fund a provincial breakfast program for students, or take an ailing healthcare system off life support\u200a-\u200athere's no price too high when it comes to getting the people of Ontario moving again.\u00a0\nPerhaps you're wondering: Haven't the experts told us time and again that lane removals and new highways won't solve gridlock?\u00a0\nWell, the people of Ontario disagree. Rip up the lanes, and urban congestion will at last disappear. Build the highways, and your soul-sucking commute will become a relic. That is a vision that we, the people of Ontario, believe. One which we are prepared to work for and pay for.\nDear cyclists, wouldn't you like to be counted among us, the people of Ontario? By most estimates, there are hundreds of thousands of utilitarian cyclists in the GTA alone. Bill 212 would ensure that there'd be room enough for all of us on our streets and highways.\nAnd so, my challenge: join me. Get a car. Let's all get cars. Thanks to the Premier's vision and fiscal conservative leadership, our roads will once again be free and flowing and yours to discover.\u00a0\nDitch the bike and buckle up. It's your prerogative, after all.\n"

For one, Bloor has been blocked for ages to construct the bike land. And it is getting so close to being done.\nIt seems absolutely insane to scrap all of those efforts at the point that we are at. So close to actually having them installed. Where actual data could be collected on the impact of traffic and how much they are used.\nOne of the immensely special things of Urban locales is that they are bikeable.  As an avid bike rider, this is to me one of the things that make Toronto great.  That I can bike across the city.\nI have been very impressed over the years at the new bike lanes. Grateful for them, as a biker but also as a driver.  I have a car share membership and find myself driving in the city 2-4 times a week for 30min-1hr.  And there is a greater relaxation as a driver on roads that have dedicated bike lanes.\nI don\u2019t agree that the provincial government should be overriding the municipal in the decision around bike lanes.  The provincial government  is representing a vast amount of people across the province, of which a very small percentage would be bike riders or use biking as a mode of daily transportation.  Thus their knowledge and expertise would be elsewhere.  Toronto as a city has a huge number of people who use biking as a daily mode of transportation. It is an important part of the transportation strategy in a city of this size.\nA crucial one.\nPlease support bike lanes.\nAnd at the very least keep them long enough to collect actual data about their impact on traffic.\nOf all the places I struggle with driving in the city, I would name the entry points, the 401 highway and the 400 highway. Those to me are the most stressful driving experiences.\n"

Here in Ottawa a great deal of time and money has been spent on creating a cycling infrastructure that compliments the rest of the roads and eliminating it would create more expense and havoc. I do not believe it would prevent accident and I state that as the partner of a cyclist who has been involved in minor accidents with cars in the past, before the addition of bicycle lanes in heavy traffic areas.

As a person who regularly commutes by bicycle in the city, I depend on streets with bike lanes to make sure I can get to my destination safely. The province would be better off investing time and money on cracking down on the thousands of motor vehicles who drive unsafely in the city, speeding through neighbourhoods and turning at intersections when it's not their turn\u2014among other things.\nAs well, bike lanes don't impede traffic flow, they improve it. The places where bikes get in the way of vehicle traffic the most is on routes that don't have bike lanes and cyclists are forced to travel among the motored vehicles. The removal of these lanes will likely lead to more traffic injuries/deaths of cyclists. If the city needs more lanes of traffic, maybe consider getting rid of on-street parking on roads such as St. Clair, where traffic is typically very congested.\nThe province should be dealing with other more important things and leave city matters in the hands of the people who run the city.\n"
