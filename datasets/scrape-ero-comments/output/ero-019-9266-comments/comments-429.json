        "comment": "In the interests of reducing gridlock in the City of Toronto, decisions on the introduction and removal of bike lanes should be left to the City itself. Funding should be increased to the City so it can better plan and phase in these changes.\nRemoving existing bike lanes will lead to additional confusion as drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians get used to yet another change to the roads. Also, many young people in the City rely on bikes since they cannot afford cars. Younger children are being raised to ride safely on bicycles. Their families have chosen not to have cars. This proposal will put these young people at additional risk and also may force their parents to acquire cars and thus increase gridlock.\nA better use of time and Provincial and City funding would be to support a better bike lane system and to increase funding to transit so people can again rely on transit and stay out of cars.\nAlso, it should be noted that gridlock in the City is being caused by the construction needed to maintain city streets and improve transit with such projects as the Eglinton Crosstown and the Ontario Line. No thought seems to have been given to coordinating this construction and the impact it  has on drivers.\nThank you for your consideration.\n"

        "comment": "On Bike Lanes:\nI grew up in Toronto, over a decade ago. Every day, when I could, I biked to school and back. My elementary was too close to justify anything past a brisk walk, but by bike my middle and high school were no more than short trip away. I intend to return to Toronto once my career allows it and live the rest of my life there, preferably car-free until my twilight years. I write this portion of the comment as a Torontonian first and Ontarian second.\nBill 212 saves nobody no time whatsoever. For those taking moderate journeys, it either returns them to their vehicles, throws them onto the main lane, or into the winding web of side streets that twist and turn in a direction vaguely parallel to the main. For those taking longer journeys by car, it ensures that they are stuck behind the extra vehicles - or worse, the cyclists who chose not to compromise by side street.\nPedestrians are the lifeblood of a city's retail area. They need little more space than that which they occupy and are easily swayed into entering a business, needing no thought as to the nearest parking space, nor to fees, nor fear of traffic around them. Cyclists are capable of a far greater range in which to roam, and though they must account for parking their bikes, they have no other disadvantages to the pedestrian. Twelve bikes can confidently fit within a single vehicle's parking space, guaranteeing double the capacity of a motor vehicle - if we assume that each vehicle is filled with five passengers every trip. Removing bicycle infrastructure from the most commercial streets removes this benefit of cycling, both making fewer people want to start trips to commercial areas and eliminating the possibility of impromptu stops.\nIn the same vein, up to six cyclists can proceed within the space a single car takes up. Removing two (half-width) bike lanes in exchange for two full lanes means potentially dumping up to four extra vehicles onto roads. Even with the increased capacity of the road, each lane can contend with, at the worst, two extra vehicles per lane per direction for every one car already on the road, that could have been instead off to the side, out of the way of the people who need to use their cars for distance or carrying capacity. It's worth noting that cycling increases disproportionately to how connected a network is - the sun is still rising on Toronto's ability to be a cycling city, and the results already make good on much of the promise. This bill will end that prematurely, returning Toronto to the very congestion that existed in the 2000s - which the bike lanes are solving!\nFinally, I believe this bill to be an absolute overreach of provincial powers. It should be the City's task to determine how best to manage its streets and transportation infrastructure. This sort of meddling is beyond what the Province's government should be engaged in, and the only silver lining is that by being a provincial bill, it allows me to express my disdain at it through this forum from my residence elsewhere in Ontario.\nOn Highways:\nWhile most of the above reasoning can be discarded, I believe that the conclusion is similar: the government should strive to find alternatives that keep people merely travelling from one place to another out of the way of those who are bringing food and products into the areas that most need them. Adding a lane just means you have four lanes of people stuck in traffic instead of three. Investing in transit means you have four lanes of people in a single streetcar instead.\nRegardless, some of the chicanery\nOn Broadband:\nThis seems an unusual bill to put such a matter in, and should be passed separately. That said, better internet access may reduce the number of trips taken on roads, making this, ironically, the only part of the bill that promises to actually improve roads for the public at large.\n"

It has been shown again and again that the only way to reduce congestion and improve driving is viable alternatives to driving. Bike lanes play an important part in keeping cars off the rode and improving safety for bikes and pedestrians alike.\nThe new amendment to the proposal is very distressing; specifying bike lanes that were recently introduced. Tearing these out will be a great cost in terms of wasted taxpayer dollars, hurting local businesses, and overall travel times in Toronto for motorists and cyclists alike.\nThis proposal is a step backwards for Ontario - it is actively wasting money to *remove* alternative modes of transportation that have been proven to reduce gridlock.\n"

In a growing city, where congestion, air quality, and accessibility are pressing issues, it\u2019s critical that we look to the future and support transportation options that are sustainable, equitable, and beneficial to all Torontonians.\nBike lanes aren\u2019t just about bicycles; they are part of a broader vision of city planning that prioritizes people, not just cars. They create safer streets, reduce emissions, and improve health outcomes, all while making it easier for residents to choose sustainable and affordable transportation options. By encouraging more cycling and walking, we can relieve traffic congestion in ways that make our streets more livable and our neighborhoods more connected.\nCities worldwide are investing in bike infrastructure to address precisely the issues we face in Toronto. Removing bike lanes is a step backward at a time when we need to be bold in designing streets that serve everyone, from drivers to cyclists to pedestrians. Let\u2019s build a city that encourages diverse transportation options and prioritizes the safety, health, and well-being of all residents.\n"

        "comment": "Ontario needs bike lanes for its economy to grow.\nIt has been repeatedly shown that improving bike infrastructure improves the local economy and vibrancy of a location. People using bikes stop more frequently to shop, meaning they are partaking in local businesses rather than buying. This means local neighbourhoods can support more stores, meaning more businesses are able to flourish and grow. This includes important neighbourhood services like grocery stores and hardware stores, but also restaurants and cafes which in turn improve the vibrancy of the location. By removing or restricting bike lanes, we create \"drive-through\" neighbourhoods which discourage local businesses and spending.\nVibrant neighbourhoods are not only good for the local economies, but also create interest among visitors, including those visiting from other cities, provinces and countries. By creating vibrant spaces in Ontario towns and cities, we therefore tap into an important economic boost.\nI live in Toronto near a newly installed bike lane that has changed my local neighbourhood for the better. As a pedestrian, I feel safer in walking on and crossing the road. The neighbourhood businesses, which do want the bike lanes, have enjoyed better sales than comparable non-bike friendly areas in Toronto. I see them in heavy use, and enjoyed by all kinds of people of all ages--some are riding to work, some are riding for fun, some are riding to school with their kids. They feel safer and there is a clear uptick in usage which will boost the local neighbourhood even more. The area feels vibrant and healthy.\nI see this mode of transport as a key part of Ontario's future, and look forward to different types of transport being available at different times for different users in different contexts. If we can reduce one or two car trips per person per week on average, that will make an enormous difference to traffic in cities where car travel times are only increasing year over year, plus reduce pollution and save energy use--both often crucial considerations for many people who decide to walk or cycle on a given trip.\nBike lanes will seem under-used prior to them being completed. \"Completed\" means networks have to be continuous and safe along key routes and between key locations. An incomplete bike lane can be compared to a road missing a bridge and perhaps offering vehicles a chance of fording a river. Of course, most users without a safe crossing method will not choose this route. Arguments based on use data collected from incomplete networks are invalid and I hope that decision-makers will not consider use-data from incomplete or not-fit-for-purpose routes as evidence.\nLastly, every day I walk by memorials representing individuals who have died on Toronto roads near me. In my years in Toronto, I have had friends injured by car collisions, and friends who are now gone due to a failure to create road infrastructure that is safe for all users. I was therefore extremely glad and relieved to see the bike lanes installed, as I hope they will help save the lives of Ontarians who are riding to work, school, or the store.\nBike infrastructure is about lives, movement, environment and the economy. All four are positives, and I hope that in a future Ontario we can have vibrant, safe neighbourhoods in which all people move freely about in ways that's appropriate for them and their trip.\n"

Doing so will put my safety at risk, and also that of my family, friends, colleagues and community. I use these bike lanes every day, all year round, to get to and from work, and to get around the city for errands and liesure. These bike lanes keep me safe from motor traffic.\nTraveling by bike is essential for those without cars (most condos now do not have sufficient parking for all), for those who cannot afford a car, or for those like me, who prefer to use their car only when traveling away from the city. When getting around the city, cycling is my preferred mode of transportation as it is healthier, more enjoyable, affordable, often faster, and I do not need to stress about parking or damage/theft to my car. These bike lanes move a tremendous amount of people (me) and goods (grocery and food delivery), and removing them may have the undesired effect of putting incremental cars on the road, for example me, if I don't feel safe now cycling. I do not want to drive in the city. Also, when I do or must drive, I much prefer when cyclists are in their own dedicated lanes, rather than sharing a lane with cars - I don't have to worry about collisions and potential deaths.\nI also disagree with the broader proposal to establish a new committee that oversees municipality decisions on road and bike lane infrastructure, where they are in fact most closely connected to communities needs. This is a misappropriation of my tax dollars. We want smaller, more efficient government with less bureaucracy. This money should go directly toward road maintenance, transit, sidewalks, highways, bridges and other safety and transportation infrastructure.\nResident of West Bend (Bloor-Dundas), Toronto\n"

        "comment": "This seems like poor urban planning and I am very skeptical that this will resolve our congestion problems. Major international cities like London and Paris have excellent public transit and bike lanes. The infrastructure enables large numbers of people to travel from different points in the city to others. Removal of the bike lanes will add more drivers because those who are cycling will drive instead. I know many people who have opted to cycle because of congestion. If you want to reduce congestion, leave the bike lanes as they are and in addition, run more buses, streetcars, and Go trains. Then there will be fewer cars on the road, allowing people who need to drive to get places. I am not a cyclist but I see removal of the bike lanes as a source of more, not less congestion. Plus, it is a huge waste of our taxpayers dollars to remove what we have paid for. If the premier is serious about reducing Toronto congestion, provide provincial funding for more public transit.\n"

Cycling is the fastest way to get around in the city and bike lanes - especially separated lanes - are very important to me. As much as I love my car and use it quite frequently, I would rather there be safe and separate bike lanes than for my car trips to save a couple minutes.\nThe major reason why I reject this bill is because it is undemocratic. Our city has gone through the democratic process of building these bike lanes and now the provincial government is going to steamroll into the city\u2019s business and start dictating what bike lanes can be made and what cannot, seems like an extreme overreach.

Highway 413 is not necessary to reduce gridlock--there is not that much existing demand to travel along its route. Rather, the government wants a highway there because they have an interest in making the land along its proposed route more attractive for development.\nThe problem is, this will worsen gridlock in the GTA as all this development will be of the type that requires residence to get around by driving (there will not be adequate public transit options), leading our streets to get even more clogged up with vehicles.\nThis kind of development is also exactly why a proper environmental assessment is needed.

        "comment": "To Whom It May Concern,\nIt is beyond contradictory that a government that has established a Ministry of Red Tape Reduction would propose to introduce a provincial red tape process for municipal affairs. Municipalities may exist at the pleasure of the province, but they exist with a democratic mandate and this proposal is nonetheless an afront to voters who have made their preference clear for years now by continuing to elect municipal governments that expand the cycling networks in their jurisdiction.\nSetting aside the anti-democratic nature of this proposal, it is also gallingly terrible policy. The three bike lanes that have clearly earned the particular ire of the premier serve the downtown core of Toronto, an area that has seen a massive population boom as people from around the world have flocked to this increasingly dense and multi-cultural city with jobs and opportunity. Toronto cannot sustain this as a car centric population - ripping out the bike lanes would not be enough. There just aren't enough bike lanes to rip out.\nThe only sustainable way for Toronto to accomodate even the population it now has, much less the growth expected, is to encourage greater use of public transit and alternate modes of transit. If these bike lanes, which serve thousands of users each day, are removed that will just mean yet more drivers on the road. Many of those cyclists in those bike lanes represent one less car on that same street.\nPutting bike lanes on side streets is no answer either. There aren't side streets that run the length of the Bloor, University, and Yonge lanes proposed for removal. And the point of a transit network, whether roads for cars or train lines or bike lanes, is to provide access to a wide variety of destinations in as direct a way as possible. Replacing these three bike lanes with a bunch of disconnected and indirect lanes is not replacing them at all - it's simple destruction of the cycling network.\nBeyond the value destroying and short sighted nature of the proposal, it is also violent. Bike lanes save lives. Cyclists and other vulnerable road users have a right to safety. The pandemic has broken the driving culture in Ontario, with reckless driving now the norm. Speeding, running red lights, blocking intersections - all behaviours of drivers that are much more common than they were, and which makes our streets less safe for everyone - cyclist, pedestrian, and driver alike.\nLastly, and personally, I appreciate streets with dedicated (and ideally fully separated) bike lanes. As a driver I find it encourages predictable cycling behaviour and makes driving less stressful for me. As a father of a young child, I want to encourage healthy habits and lifestyle, and that includes active modes of transit like walking and cycling - which is only possible when those modes are safe.\nIf this government wants to reduce gridlock, I would encourage them to look for policies and proposals that would improve driver behaviour. I would encourage them to look for policies and proposals that would reduce the number of drivers on the road in the first place - including ways to encourage journeys currently being done by car to happen with other modes.\nIt doesn't matter whether you walk, bike, take transit, or drive, I think we all want the same thing: fewer drivers.\n"

        "comment": "This bill, proposing the removal of many kilometres of existing bike lanes, as well as adding red tape/bureaucracy to the implementation of new cycling infrastructure is a proven deficit to the safety of human life. As a born Torontonian and someone who grew up using cycling as my primary method of transportation, particularly on the Bloor/Danforth corridor, the removal of these existing bike lanes is a destructive step backwards into dark and dangerous times. As it has been proven again and again by many studies, more lanes does not alleviate traffic congestion. When I say removal I mean removal. The proposed \u201cmoving\u201d of bike lanes to adjacent side streets not only significantly lengthens trip time for existing cyclists (therefore reducing the amount of cyclists willing to use these alternate routes) but also practically guarantees that the city/province will absolutely drag its feet wherever possible when actually implementing these new, longer, more useless routes. Secondarily, the removal of years of dedicated cycling infrastructure along bloor will also cost taxpayer dollars and cause congestion given the required construction crews and road work. Every single point I can possibly think of is rallied against this bill, and it is evident to me that this is blatant disregard for human life in favour of saving drivers unlikely minutes on their commutes (that could have been faster if they felt safe riding a bike). For years upon years I have cycled across the city, and passed thousands or tens of thousands of cars sitting in gridlock, whether bike lanes exist or not. Just know, that if this bill passes I can guarantee you one thing; that I will take the full car lane that the law states I have a right to. Doesn\u2019t that sound slower to you?\n"
