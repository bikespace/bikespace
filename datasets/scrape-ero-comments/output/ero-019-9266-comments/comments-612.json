        "comment": "As someone who frequently drives, cycles, walks, as well as subways on Bloor Street quite often, I believe that the removal of these bike lanes will only cause more distress and be an overall kerfuffle to both drivers and cyclists.\nAlthough I walk and subway on Bloor street often enough, I will focus on the perspective of a driver and cyclist, since I believe those would be the two most impacted personas from this proposal. The conclusion that I attempt to express is that both folks, drivers and cyclists, will be negatively affected by the removal of these bike lanes.\nAs with any downtown, driving in downtown Toronto is busy and hectic. Bloor street is no exception to this. As a driver, I am always vigilant of my surroundings. As drivers are aware, there are a multitude of things to be aware of while driving in order to stay safe as a driver, and also to ensure you do not put others in danger. When I am driving, one great thing I appreciate and love about the bike lanes is that it separates bikes from cars. This means that I can focus on one less possible interaction on the road, while driving between intersections. Let's think about what would happen if we removed the bike lanes. Cyclists would share the road, and vehicles would have to share the road with cyclists. This adds an additional stress on drivers to ensure that they do not endanger cyclists.\nAs a cyclist, cycling in a guarded bike lane (as we have on Bloor street with concrete barriers, rather than just paint), I feel safer from the possibility of being hit by a car. This makes biking along Bloor street a very peaceful and enjoyable experience. Not needing to constantly brake and reaccelerate (which on a manual cycle means exerting more physical effort, which I don't always have when rushing to work in the morning) leaves me getting to work on time in a safe and consistent manner. If bike lanes are removed, almost all of this peacefulness and safety that the bike lanes provide would be removed. If I still was to bike, I would be stressed sharing the road with cars, thinking about my safety when surrounding myself between vehicles. If I wasn't cycling, I would have to take another mode of transportation. The only two modes of transportation that would compare to the speed of a cycle would be a vehicle or the subway. The subway is fine, and can hold lots of capacity. However, cars take up a whole lot more space and are not space efficient. The removal of a bike lane would thus induce more demand for cars on the road. Cycles are much more space efficient than cars. So what would end up happening is that many cyclists would be displaced to driving cars, making Bloor street a lot busier to drive on as a car driver.\nIf the whole point of this project was to reduce traffic on Bloor street, we see that removing bike lanes on Bloor street would only cause more cyclists to drive, thus making traffic worse. Providing cyclists their own proper lane would promote more cyclists to bike there, leaving more space for people who want to drive.\nI genuinely hope that these bike lanes are not removed. They make my life easier as a driver and a cyclist in Toronto.\nThank you. :)\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nI am quite concerned about the plans to remove bike lanes along Bloor, Yonge, and University.\n1. I believe the bike lanes along University Avenue were just recently installed. To remove it would cost 48 million. Who would pay for this? The city, who had to spend $130,000 to install the lanes and now has to remove it? Are we going to have a repeat of the Scarborough RT, where replacing the trains that would have run alongside the route costed more money, pushed the project back by a year, and costed the province more money to fix the issues that plagued the line?\n2. I travel along Bloor Street from time to time to reach where I work. I have never seen any issues with traffic at all. But the removal would cause traffic wouldn\u2019t it? And what would happen when Line 2 closes? That is guaranteed to generate even more traffic.\n3. Speaking of, those lanes not only protect bikers (which I will bring up later), but most importantly, gives them space to ride safely. Where would the bikers go when the lanes are removed? The sidewalk? In downtown, especially on Yonge and University Streets, that would be a nightmare especially for people walking and navigating the area by foot? On the road? In downtown? Traffic on the aforementioned roads is oftimes at a standstill. Add people biking on the roads into this and this is a disaster waiting to happen. Especially during this time when, for the past 10 years, about 400 biker have been injured, with 28 of them succumbing to their wounds!\nThere are more ways the 48 million can be well spent. Adding more doctors, education, improvements to healthcare, transit, or investing into affordable housing. Why is it that removing bike lanes of all things is the top priority? It certainly won\u2019t help people like me struggling to make a living.\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nI am very concerned about the proposed removal of bike lanes in Toronto. First, as a cyclist myself, I want to have a safe and protected way to get around (to work, to the store, to visit friends, etc., not just for commuting!).\nSecond, I have two children who bike, and I want them to be able to get around safely!\nThird, cars are the biggest killers in our cities. I want cars to harm less people by driving slower. The bike lanes slow the cars down.\nMore people will choose to bike instead of driving if there are bike lanes to keep them safe - replacing cars with bikes will reduce gridlock.\nIf we want to have any hope of meeting our climate commitments, we want to give people more options for getting around quickly and safely without using a car. Please keep the bike lanes and build more!\n"

        "comment": "This bill is a complete waste of money and goes against all accepted city-planning expertise and decades of studies supporting bike lanes as safe. More lanes just gives more traffic and fewer safe alternatives. This is not the province's jurisdiction--everything about this bill is ignorant and inappropriate. Toronto should be introducing congestion charging and investing in public transit as well as MORE bike lanes if it wants to address its gridlock. Any sensible city planner knows this, and it's been demonstrated in cities around the world (including cities colder and snowier than ours).\n"

        "comment": "I am a practicing professional transportation planner, road safety analyst and infrastructure designer who lives in Ottawa and practices all over Canada. The proposed requirement to obtain approval from the Ministry of Transportation before constructing new bike lanes that would reduce the number of lanes available for motor vehicle traffic is problematic for several reasons.\nUndermining Local Autonomy\nFirstly, the bill undermines local autonomy and expertise in transportation planning. Municipalities are best positioned to understand the unique needs and challenges of their communities. By centralizing the decision-making process, Bill 212 disregards the nuanced and context-specific knowledge that local planners bring to the table. This top-down approach could lead to decisions that do not adequately address local traffic patterns, safety concerns, or community preferences. Local governments have historically been responsible for making transportation decisions that reflect the specific needs of their residents, and this bill disrupts that balance.\nPrioritizing Motor Vehicle Traffic\nSecondly, Bill 212 prioritizes motor vehicle traffic over the safety and convenience of cyclists and pedestrians. The bill's emphasis on maintaining lanes for cars overlooks the benefits of bike lanes, which include improved safety for cyclists, reduced traffic congestion, and enhanced public health. Studies have shown that well-designed bike facilities can significantly reduce accidents and fatalities among cyclists. By making it more difficult to implement these bike lanes, the bill could discourage cycling, a sustainable and healthy mode of transportation. This is particularly concerning given the growing need for environmentally friendly transportation options to combat climate change.\nEnvironmental Impact\nMoreover, the bill's focus on reducing gridlock for cars fails to consider the broader benefits of bike lanes. Bike lanes can contribute to a more balanced and efficient transportation system by encouraging more people to cycle instead of drive. This shift can lead to reduced traffic congestion, lower greenhouse gas emissions, and improved air quality. In the context of the global climate crisis, promoting cycling and other forms of active transportation is more important than ever. Cities around the world, including in Ontario, are increasingly recognizing the importance of and reaping the benefits of creating inclusive and multi-modal transportation networks that accommodate cyclists, pedestrians, and public transit users.\nPublic Health and Quality of Life\nAdditionally, effective transportation planning should balance the needs of all road users, not just look at motorists. Bike lanes are not just about transportation; they are also about public health and quality of life. Encouraging cycling can lead to healthier lifestyles, reduced healthcare costs, and more vibrant communities. By making it harder to build bike lanes, Bill 212 could have negative repercussions for public health. Furthermore, bike lanes can enhance the livability of urban areas by reducing noise pollution, creating safer streets, and fostering a sense of community.\nEconomic Considerations\nThere are also economic considerations to take into account. Cities that invest in cycling infrastructure often see economic benefits, including increased property values, more vibrant local businesses, and reduced transportation costs for residents. By hindering the development of bike lanes, Bill 212 could stifle these economic opportunities. Moreover, the cost of maintaining roads for motor vehicles is significantly higher than for bike lanes, meaning that promoting cycling can lead to long-term savings for municipalities.\nConclusion\nIn summary, Bill 212 poses significant risks to local transportation planning, road safety, environmental sustainability, public health, and economic vitality. It represents a step backward in efforts to create safer, more sustainable, and more livable cities. It is essential to stop this legislation and advocate for policies that support comprehensive, inclusive transportation planning. By doing so, we can create communities that are not only more efficient and environmentally friendly but also healthier and more economically vibrant.\n"

        "comment": "Removing the bike lanes is a backwards proposal and is not only making the roads dangerous for bike riders, but also is a waste of tax money. This is a perfect example of corruption. Closing the Ontario Science Center is another corruption example in our city of Toronto. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!\n"

        "comment": "The province seems to be unaware of what induced demand is. Studies have shown that removing bike lanes will do nothing to fix traffic, as any traffic improvements temporarily gained will quickly vanish as cars once again fill up the streets and gridlock ensues. Bike lane usage is way above the ~1% suggested by the province, and it is not higher precisely because the network needs more improvements. Mr. Ford has fallen for a fallacy in that there is a cycle of bike infrastructure not being well-developed enough for cyclists to use, therefore not as many people use it, therefore the infrastructure is perceived as not needed, while in reality the province must break this cycle by making new infrastructure. You don't see many bikes on the bike lanes not because nobody uses them, but because they're never stuck in traffic and therefore don't linger long enough to make an impression the way cars do. People need more ways of transportation other than cars; remember that the TTC carries way more people in its subway under Bloor, Yonge, and University than cars do; cars are the minority here. The real solution to traffic is to get more people out of their cars and into bikes, buses, trains, and streetcars - it is mathematically much more efficient, and also makes getting around the city easier and more accessible for all users, including drivers, as the streets will be less clogged. We must invest in more cycling and transit infrastructure as this is the real way of fixing traffic - infrastructure is very much a \"build it and they will come\" thing, and this applies just as much to cycling and transit.\n"

        "comment": "Writing as a cyclist and driver who lives in the neighbourhoods directly impacted by this decision, I am in complete opposition to the proposed legislation. The bike lanes allow my children and I to safely commute to work, school, and other family activities. Removing these lanes will make our lives notably less safe. Also, as the City of Toronto has noted, in addition to the increased danger to the lives and safety of cyclists, the removal of the bike lanes will actually make traffic congestion in our neighbourhood even worse\u2013as a driver, I fully expect that will make driving as well more difficult and even more dangerous. Finally, this whole exercise is a huge waste of taxpayer's money. Burning $48 MM on top of the existing $27 MM invested sunk cost to place people's lives in jeopardy \u2026 is madness. Stop this dangerous waste and keep Bloor Street West an integrated community. Bloor Street is the Main Street of our community, with shops that we can walk to and engaging events throughout the year. Don't destroy our community in the name of trying to turn our main street into a highway that it never should be.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 directly suppresses many societal groups and makes the problem it tries to address worse. This is justified in the following.\nRoad congestion is caused by too many cars on the road, not by too many bikes. The bill will discourage even more people from using alternative transportation for short trips and will ultimately increase congestion via induced demand. This is especially a problem for those groups who already today refrain from independent and active transportation modes, including children, girls, women, persons with disability, and elderly persons. This affects the overall health of Ontarians, school children's performance, gender equality, and equity efforts. For example, it has been shown that Canadian girls are intentionally held more indoors than Canadian boys, while this is not the case in societies that support active transportation modes. On our streets, conflicts between different traffic modes are common in Ontario, and Ontario's accident and fatal accident statistics are among the worst in comparable provinces and countries. Removing protected bike lanes would make this much worse and increase the inequality among Ontarians.\nProtected bike lanes are an important tool to make cycling safer and more accessible.  The bill will lead to more fatal accidents on our roads and contribute to the exclusion and suppression of already marginalized groups.\nMost importantly, it has been shown over and over again that bicycle lanes and public transportation, but not private vehicle lanes, save us time, especially in dense urban regions such as Toronto. The reason is the number of people that can be transported within a given timeframe. This bill is directly making the problem it tries to address worse.\n"
