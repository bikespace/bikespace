        "comment": "Best common sense bill in years. The bike lane bullies of Toronto have their tentacles all through city hall and have been fabricating data on usage, winter ridership, poor weather day ridership, impact on local business, and impact on working Torontonians trying to navigate through the city. The bike lobby group have been padding their surveys and completely disregarding the absolute fact that ridership from November through March is mainly just the food delivery mechanized bikes that pay no taxes, are completely unregulated and enjoy these empty through fares for their own benefit .\nToronto city hall should also be pressed to limit the amount of stagnant road construction projects throughout the city. Construction companies routinely begin construction then leave pylons around the unfinished work and finish the work at the very end of their contract agreements to avoid penalties. Construction on any multilane road should never have stagnant days of work\nEg. Lawrence east from Mildenhall to Bayview, New pipe being inserted. Construction commenced on Aug 28, from Sept 4 till today ( Nov 20 ) minimal work has been done , Northern curbside lane closed for almost 87 days. Really just a storage area for the construction company. With a school being right beside this construction the congestion in morning and afternoon is hellish.\nHow can this take 87 days ? Why start a job you cant complete?\nThis is a congestion type of cancer all over the city. In fact i wish i had the Pylon and Construction tape contract for this city. I drive every day all over the city and can never remember seeing so many plyons and so little work being done.\nWhy do so many roads need bike lanes on both sides of the road, these riders simply don't exist in any significant numbers and dont exist at all during the winter months.\nSave our city from the Daydreamers at city hall that clearly have too many members and far to much time on their hands.\nThanks\n"

        "comment": "**1. Ensuring Safety for Cyclists**\nProtected bike lanes are essential for safeguarding cyclists by creating a barrier between them and motor vehicles, reducing the risk of collisions. My experience cycling in Toronto for six months, particularly while doing delivery jobs, has shown how bike lanes prevent vehicles like cars, buses, and motorcycles from dangerously encroaching on cyclists. Without these barriers, cyclists are forced into close proximity with vehicles, especially during traffic congestion or bad weather. Protected bike lanes also mitigate risks when roads are slippery due to rain or snow, providing a safer, designated space for cyclists to ride without the fear of being splashed or hit if they slip.\n**2. Encouraging Sustainable Transportation**\nBike lanes make cycling a viable and efficient commuting option for residents. They offer a faster, more reliable alternative to driving, especially in congested areas. From personal experience, riding on protected bike lanes significantly increased my efficiency compared to navigating regular roads or painted bike lanes, which often left me splitting through heavy traffic. Expanding bike lane networks will encourage more people to cycle, reducing the number of cars on the road and easing overall traffic congestion.\n**3. Enhancing Urban Livability and Accessibility**\nBy supporting bike lanes, cities can offer a safer and more equitable transportation option for those who cannot afford cars or prefer not to drive. They reduce emissions and urban noise while improving access to businesses and services. In Toronto, where heavy rains often flood unprotected bike paths with water, debris, and leaves, protected bike lanes offer a vital safeguard for cyclists. They ensure smoother commutes and encourage active transportation, fostering a healthier, more livable city.\n**4. Better Allocation of Resources**\nInstead of spending millions to remove existing bike lanes, these funds could be redirected to expand protected bike lanes in high-traffic areas, improving safety and reducing accidents. Investing in bike lanes aligns with Toronto\u2019s growth and sustainability goals, enhancing its appeal as a global, forward-thinking city.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes, especially the Bloor Street bike lane, paved the way for me to adopt cycling as my main mode of transportation.\nBefore my second year of university, I never considered cycling to be a feasible mode of transportation. This was mainly due to my fears about safety while cycling - I was very frightened by the prospect of colliding with a car while on a bike.\nThen, in my second year of university, when reviewing my options for my commute, my maps app indicated that commuting by bicycle would take just 20 minutes, faster than if I were to take the subway. Moreover, the route it recommended was extremely simple to follow: get to Bloor Street and stay on Bloor, which would get me most of the way there.\nAt the time, I was quite apprehensive about giving commuting by bicycle a try. However, knowing that there was a protected, dedicated bicycle lane on Bloor Street, I figured I would give it a shot.\nFor that year, the Bloor Street bicycle lane only went west to Christie, around the halfway point of my route. Each morning, I would be ecstatic to reach the safety of the protected lane once I reached Christie. Conversely, each evening, I would anxiously join the car traffic once the lane disappeared. The difference between cycling in the lane (east of Christie) and cycling with no lane (west of Christie) was jarring. Without the lane, the speed and close proximity with which cars would zip past me was immediately apparent and stressful. There were often also cars parked curbside during my commutes, which made me feel confined to the sliver of lane between the parked cars and the lane of moving traffic. In such an environment, I felt as if I needed to ride my bike extremely carefully, otherwise run the risk of colliding with a car. Once in the lane, my commute felt much safer and less stressful. The cars were no longer right beside me, and I felt like I could bike much more casually.\nCommuting to university for that year, by bicycle, helped me develop confidence in using a bicycle to get around. Cycling has remained my main mode of transportation to this day, as I enjoy the exercise built in to cycling, its low monetary cost, and the fun I have riding my bike. The Bloor Street bicycle lane started this meaningful change in my life, and I hope it does not get removed. To me, its presence - and the presence of protected bike lanes like it - provide people in Toronto access to a safe, easy, reassuring environment to get around by bicycle.\n"

        "comment": "Removing the bike lanes along Bloor St is a dangerous and costly move! I live in the area just off of Bloor W and I see how useful the bike lanes are, and have used them myself. Bloor is a busy street, and having a designated space for bikers keeps them safe from cars. It also encourages more people to bike, which is safer for the environment. I would be less likely to use a bike without knowing I could do so safely in a bike lane.\nRemoving the bike lanes will also be costly, especially considering the number of city bike postings that are connected to these bike lanes. Realistically I don\u2019t believe removing them will create enough space to reduce traffic congestion along Bloor. There is a better use of city funds. To truly help Torontonians with their morning commutes put more money toward the TTC! Every morning there is a delay or someone is injuring themselves or others. I am always late to work, as are my coworkers. We need to run more trains and we need mental health support for those who seek refuge in the subways because there is nowhere else for them to go.\nPlease don\u2019t waste tax payer money removing bike lanes, which are a necessary safety precaution!\n"

Cycling is not only a more eco friendly method of transportation, but it\u2019s also more accessible to individuals experiencing poverty, who may not be able to afford a car or bus fare.

When there are better alternatives, people use those. The only thing that cures traffic is better alternatives to driving. Until those in charge of this province realize this, traffic will only get worse. And with worse traffic, who will dare stop and support the local businesses when it means that it takes much longer to get home? Bike lanes increase road safety for everyone, \u00a0pedestrians, cyclists, drivers, motorcyclists, public transportation users. Not forgetting to mention how the roadworks of the Gardiner Expressway have impacted traffic everywhere else in the city as people are taking detours to avoid the Gardiner whenever possible, and now Bloor, the Queensway, Lake Shore are all extremely busy. It used to take me 15min to drive downtown from south Etobicoke, and it now takes between 30min-45min if I'm lucky, so I much prefer taking the inner roads. Just multiplying the bike lanes, increasing the frequency of Go trains and developing a better network for the TTC will certainly show relief on our roads.\nOntario Professional Planners Institute statement: https://ontarioplanners.ca/OPPIAssets/Documents/Policy-Papers/OPPI-Stat\u2026\nCanadian Institute of Transportation Engineers statement:\nhttps://www.itecanada.org/the-benefits-of-active-transportation-infrast\u2026\nOntario Society of Professional Engineers statement:\nhttps://ospe.on.ca/advocacy/response-to-bill-212-why-we-need-to-rethink\u2026\n"

        "comment": "Hello! I am a 15 year old child that takes a bike to school 4/5 days a week. I need to bike since to get my 30 minutes of exercise a day (something most car drivers don't get) and it makes me happier and more free than the people trapped in an oversized metal beast. I rely on bike lanes to keep me safe and remove some of my fear and worry from a possible collision. In grade 9, the bike lane on Bloor near Royal York and old mill was not finished yet, and thankfully I only had to bike through that nightmare once before they put safety for me. I found it a scary experience. Cars were whooshing by me and if they had been a little more to the right, that would have ended me right then and there. I live in Danforth, so to get to my school (Etobicoke school of the arts) I have to ride for nearly and hour to get there. This bill plans to take my safety away on major parts of this route, and I take Bloor the entire way to my school. The audacity some people have to dismiss my mode of transport that actually helps urban design and the environment far more than any other mode of transport, is truly unethical. I do not want to have the chances that I may die on my way to school to be raised by massive amounts just so that some car drivers can get to work nearly 2 minutes earlier. I mean really? 2 minutes? Car drivers are protected. they have airbags, seatbelts and tonnes of metal surrounding them to keep them safe. But the poor person outside who got hit? Just a sheet of metal, whamming all the life out of them and pulling them under to be crushed to death. If one really wants to reduce traffic time, just get people off cars! don't encourage them to get on more cars because it's not safe to use a reasonable mode of transportation anymore. Even now, with bike lanes, I have gotten into a car crash that almost twisted my ankle and made me shed blood. If you take them out, not only will more people die, but the whole world is going in the wrong direction. A direction that can end up in concrete wastelands and extreme temperatures. I am strongly against this bill because it is a bill that will strip my safety away, force me onto a mode of transportation I am not happy with, cause only more road deaths and cause more climate change. This bill will make Toronto a dangerous place to live in. There will be 6 lane streets in downtown (University street) that will be ugly and threaten to murder anyone who dares cross the road in an attempt to reach the grocery store on the other side. The fact that this is actually happening makes me sad. I will not reach 12th grade and I may already be dead, and if not dead, fatally injured or very unhealthy, unhappy and financially troubled because I chose an alternate method of transportation. I cannot believe that some people still think it is a good idea to build more roads and drive more cars. Can't they see that by the time they die they left my generation a dead world? Please don't remove the bike lanes, you are risking my life and many, many others.\n"

        "comment": "As I reflect on the implications of Bill 212, my heart grows heavy with concern for the safety of our streets. The proposed removal of bike lanes threatens to increase the risk of accidents, placing cyclists and pedestrians in harm's way. It\u2019s disheartening to think that in a city striving for safety, we might disregard the evidence showing that protected lanes lead to fewer injuries. This is particularly concerning to me as a new father and resident of Bloordale that will be directly affected by this dissapointing overreach by our provincial government.\nMoreover, this bill seems to turn its back on our commitment to the environment. By prioritizing cars over cycling, we risk deepening our reliance on fossil fuels and increasing emissions. In a time when we should be championing sustainable transportation, this move feels like a step backward, one that could cloud our air and compromise the health of our communities.\nThe promise of alleviating traffic congestion rings hollow when we consider the reality: removing bike lanes is likely to bring more vehicles onto our roads, worsening the very gridlock we seek to escape. It\u2019s a puzzling contradiction that could drown out the vibrant life of our neighborhoods in a cacophony of engines and horns.\nAnd then there\u2019s the financial cost. This is not just a matter of infrastructure; it\u2019s about investing wisely in our future. Why would we choose to spend so much to undo progress?\nFinally, I worry about the autonomy of our municipalities. This bill encroaches on local decision-making, stripping away the power of communities to shape their own transportation networks. Each neighborhood has its unique needs, and it feels unjust to impose one-size-fits-all solutions from above.\nIn closing, I urge the provincial government to reconsider this path. Let us not forsake safety, environmental stewardship, and community voices for convenience. Together, we can forge a future that embraces all forms of transportation and strikes a fair balance between local resident and commuter needs.\n"

Removing the bike lanes is a mistake. It would not solve congestion only lead to more traffic & unsafe conditions for all who use our roads. Removing and limiting bike lanes should be enough to end this bill, but the true problems with this bill are deeper than they seem. Removing environmental protections and surveying before building highways is a mistake. The Greenbelt & our wildlife should be protected. I am deeply saddened by the state of our provincial government if these are the sort of bills being passed with priority while thousands of Ontarians suffer without adequate healthcare, education is suffering, & the housing crisis is not being addressed.

        "comment": "Bill 212 seems to be the latest costly and ineffective piece of policy erupting from Queen's Park.\nThe destruction of bike lanes will not solve congestion that's due to construction or increased motorized vehicle use by an increasingly larger urban population. Tiny vehicles, like bikes, will address the gridlock. Furthermore, Bill 212 will put lives at risk of serious injury or even death. Who in their right mind would want to risk that?\nThe Association of Municipalities of Ontario, Ontario Professional Planners Institute, Ontario Society of Professional Engineers, and Ontario Traffic Council have all come out against Bill 212.\n120 physicians and researchers wrote a joint letter opposing Bill 212.\nThe words \u201csafety\u201d and \u201chealth\u201d do not appear anywhere in the bike lane sections of Bill 212, and the only consideration to approve or remove bike lanes would be \u201cthe orderly movement of motor vehicle traffic.\nIt is false that only 1.2% of people bike to work in Toronto, and according to the province\u2019s still confidential data, nearly 10% of all trips in the city that end in downtown Toronto are taken by bike or other micromobility vehicles.\nFor bike lanes on Bloor, University, and Yonge, there are no feasible parallel alternate routes that wouldn\u2019t also result in the conversion of motor vehicle lanes.\nThe estimated financial impact is $48 million (but that's probably a conservative figure) in additional costs to provincial taxpayers for the removal of bike lanes on Bloor, University, and Yonge alone. That seems to be unacceptably poor financial management in my opinion. As a taxpayer, I cannot agree with that when we have so many other pressing societal needs.\nThank you.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly disagree with this proposal. I can appreciate that gridlock and traffic congestion place a burden on every major city. However, the proposed solution in Bill 212 regarding bike lane removal seems far too extreme for what it is worth.\nRequiring municipalities to obtain provincial approval before implementing bike lanes that require traffic lane removal is not appropriate to be in the jurisdiction of the province. Municipal bike lane decisions do not seem like the type of thing that affects Ontarians at large, but the citizens of each municipality.\nRequiring Toronto to remove any part of the bike lanes on Bloor Street, Yonge Street, or University Avenue would be simultaneously an overstepping of jurisdiction by the province and a significant blow to a core part of Toronto's culture.\nImproving the experience of bicycling in any city is good for the mental and physical health of the population and builds a stronger sense of community. It is accessible to those who cannot afford to drive. If anything, the provincial government should be improving bicycling infrastructure throughout Ontario to improve our health and reduce our environmental impact.\nThe province has not shown sufficient evidence that the proposed bike lane removals and added restrictions on traffic lane replacements will significantly benefit traffic congestion anywhere in Ontario. The province has not shown by how much traffic congestion is expected to be improved by.\nThe objectives laid out in this bill would be better achieved by directing our resources to improving the public transit and bicycling experience and incentivizing people to use those means of transportation. The province has not done enough in those areas.\nThis Bill also seems to be a Toronto bill framed as an Ontario bill, with other municipalities being unnecessarily as collateral.\nThe proposal will disproportionately affect underprivileged people who will have to continue biking, but will now be in much more dangerous road sharing situations throughout the province.\n"

It creates even more red tape for municipalities if MTO oversees local bike infrastructure policies that calm streets, encourages healthy travel and save lives. Please do not spend close to $50 million dollars to rip up Toronto bike lanes when there are much larger transportation priorities that the province should take care of (e.g Eglinton Crosstown, Hazel McCallion Line and Finch West).\nAll studies show that bike lanes do not cause congestion -- it is motor vehicles. Only active transportation and transit infrastructure can reduce the volume of vehicles on the road along with advanced mobility pricing measures. A dynamic area-wide road pricing system that can actually manage traffic demand and decrease congestion is the only answer. Otherwise induced travel will fill up any new lanes.\nSee links below for further information.\nI urge the government to reverse course on Bill 212 and amend Bill 162 (Schedule 6) so governments can implement equitable road pricing measures that will actually reduce gridlock and support sustainable transportation choices.

I am happy to walk, cycle or take transit to ALL of my destinations. I am healthier for it, learn more about my neighbourhood by travelling through it more slowly, and I know I am not contributing to a child's asthma or a senior's lung or heart condition.\nI see people of all ages in Etobicoke Centre beginning to cycle more: a family of 4 on Bloor St., a father teaching his two young children to ride safely on a sidewalk, a senior couple shopping together on Bloor St., two teenage boys riding on a bike path in Wincott Park but judging it too dangerous to bike on nearby Dixon Road or Kipling Ave.\nIn short, the development of a bike NETWORK doesn't immediately bring out people who've been hiding bikes for fear of using them. They've been told that they're not welcome on city streets and deserve any injury that comes to them: \"streets are for cars.\" Anywhere in the world where safe cycling lanes and networks have been installed, the number of cyclists increases OVER TIME, but within 1-3 years as people gain the confidence to buy a bike for the first time since they were children.\nFor the life of me, I don't understand why the merchant members of The Kingsway B.I.A. are not preparing to welcome the thousands of new residents who are and will be moving into the new high-rise developments being built on Bloor St., where the bike parking spaces are outnumber car spaces by 2 or 3 times. Why are these merchants expressing little care for welcoming and keeping safe these new customers, and instead concerning themselves with the cars that simply drive through their shopping district on the way elsewhere?\nAFFORDABILITY should be a concern to Premier Ford and the Ontario Government: each of those new apartments and condos will be $30,000-$100,000 cheaper because the basement car parking spaces will be so much fewer. Many of those new residents will want to enjoy walking or cycling to nearby stores, churches, libraries, and they will have more money in their pockets because they aren't spending thousands of dollars annually owning and maintaining a car.\nIf all those new households in Bloor Street high-rises included one or more cars each, our traffic problems would become even more problematic.\nThe first duty of a government is to keep its citizens safe. Bill 212 promises harm to those who cannot or choose not to drive cars everywhere.\n"
