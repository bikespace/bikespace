Not only do bike lanes reduce traffic, they also keep cyclists safe. Doug Ford actually went for a bike ride and agreed that he felt unsafe when riding on a road without a bike lane.\nThe proposal is not backed by evidence. Instead it seems like a short sighted decision made by those who don\u2019t want to hear about data and instead want to pander to those with a poor understanding of civil engineering.\nI strongly oppose this proposal.\n"

        "comment": "This is a ridiculous overreach. It is environmentally short-sighted, infrastructurally illogical, and ignores the needs of many Ontarians.\nTo improve the flow of traffic, we need fewer drivers, which means creating and funding enticing alternatives. The GO train is frankly often a faster, less headache-y way of getting downtown. I am at Bay and Bloor regularly--removing the lanes will not improve the flow of traffic there, for example. I support the return of the Northlander.\nRemoving bike lanes seems to counter the broader environmental goals of the PC gov't and instead panders to drivers who complain about cyclists. I say this because it seems so ill thought out. We want Ontario to be world class, but we aren't acting like it in terms of infrastructure.\n"

By removing bike lanes on major roads you WILL make the problem worse because those cyclists aren't just going to switch to using a car, they're going to keep riding on that road and now they'll take the entire car lane as is their right to do!\nI'd also like to point out that good tax money was spent putting these lanes in and arbitrarily removing them at cost to the taxpayers doesn't sound like something the \"party of fiscal responsibility\" should be doing.\n"

Why Ford feels like he needs to tear out the bike lanes from Bloor, University and Yonge is beyond me, but here is some feedback: stay in your lane. Please, Ford and company, try to remember the divisions of power, and the duty that you swore to uphold when you stepped into office. It's not hard, I'll remind you: Federal government should deal with federal matters, provincial government should deal with provincial matters, and municipal government should deal with municipal matters, and to try and act in the best interest of your voter base. Don't go treading on Chow's toes just because you hate your drive to work. There are people in Toronto who don't have cards, and don't live in the suburbs. These people would like to bike to and from work without getting mowed down by a Ford F-150.\n"

This is unsafe for the cyclists, and frustrating for drivers (who will likely be held up by cyclists).\nThe proposed change is short-sighted, reactionary, and completely contrary to evidence from Toronto and other growing cities across the world.\nLet\u2019s be very clear: Doug Ford and the Conservative government are showing that they are willing to sacrifice the safety and convenience of many for the very vocal, uninformed few, and waste millions of taxpayer dollars in the process.\nRemoving bike lanes in Toronto, against the democratic will of Torontonians (who elected possibly one of the most pro-cycling mayors in the city\u2019s history), would be a colossal electoral mistake and tremendous moral failing.\n"

Inched along before getting to medical building. Two street parking spots in front of medical building frequented mainly by advanced seniors removed for bike lane.\nParked for 1.5 hours observing traffic. Constant back up on north side of Bloor. Very slow on south side. Constant stream of cars traveling in both directions and about 8 bikes during the whole time (on the warmest, most beautiful day of October. February, how many?). Not one bike rider had an advanced senior on the back, holding on for dear life.\nPopulation aging. Let's use some common sense when deciding on transportation policy.\n"

        "comment": "This is a terrible bill. More lanes for cars will result in worse traffic. Bike lanes, along with other forms of public transportation are the only solutions that are proven to reduce traffic. Once again, the Progressive Conservatives are meddling in areas upon which they have no expertise in to favour the interests of their donors. In this case, this bill helps car manufacturers, and all others involved in maintaining a car-centric culture. Furthermore, cars are a considerable source of pollution and contribution to climate change and environmental degradation. Bike lanes in contrast to cars are a solution to combat climate change. But if the adequate infrastructure doesn\u2019t exist for cyclists people will not bike and will choose to drive. Providing adequate bike infrastructure is providing equitable access for people to move within cities. Bikes are considerably cheaper, which is bad for car manufacturers that seek to maximize profits. Overall, bike lanes are a necessary solution that benefits everyone except the Progressive Conservatives, car manufacturers and anyone else maintaining the car centric culture of Ontario; and the provincial government should instead promote the construction of bike lanes, not prevent or remove bike lanes. Without bike lanes I would be considerably and negatively impacted in my ability to get to work, shop, or exist within my community.\n"

People should be incentivized to take public transit and bike/walk instead of using their cars. Funding the public transit systems and building  more trains will do this and minimize environmental impacts.\nInstead of spending billions on a new highway, buy back the 407 instead! This will easily reduce traffic on the 401 and then another highway can be looked into if needed.\n"

        "comment": "I want to express my deep concern and opposition to the proposed Bill 212. As a citizen of Ontario who resides in Toronto, I believe that this legislation represents a significant overreach of provincial authority and poses a threat to the livability of our city.\nAs a person who relies on bike lanes as my primary mode of transportation, I can attest firsthand to the vital role they play in ensuring my safety, convenience, and overall quality of life. Bike lanes make Toronto a more liveable and enjoyable city for residents who choose sustainable modes of travel, while also alleviating congestion, reducing emissions, and encouraging healthier lifestyles. The existence of these lanes not only benefits cyclists but improves overall mobility by offering more choices for efficient travel.\nBill 212, however, threatens to undermine these benefits by placing undue restrictions on municipalities' ability to create and maintain bike lanes, especially when they may require the removal of a traffic lane. It is my belief that this bill is a blatant overstep by the Province of Ontario into matters that should be handled by local governments, which are far better equipped to understand the specific transportation needs and priorities of their communities.\nToronto, in particular, faces unique urban challenges, including the need for progressive transportation solutions. By imposing a provincial framework that limits the flexibility of municipalities to make decisions that reflect their local realities, Bill 212 hampers our city\u2019s ability to respond to its growing population and diverse transportation needs.\nI urge the provincial government to reconsider the scope of Bill 212 and recognize the value of supporting municipal autonomy, especially in matters like urban transportation infrastructure. The future of Toronto\u2014and other cities in Ontario\u2014depends on the development of inclusive, forward-thinking policies that prioritize the safety and well-being of all residents.\n"

I observe thousands of people using these bike lanes including myself. To remove them would be a step in the wrong direction. Bike lanes are proven to reduce congestion, improve health of residents and get more people to travel within a corridor much faster. To remove bike lanes and replace them with cars would be a total waste and end up increasing congestion to a growing city.\nIf anything this city needs more bike lanes. Please reconsider this decision and focus on projects that actually concern the province and not municipalities.\n"

Removing existing bike lanes and blocking the development of new infrastructure will not only make cycling more dangerous, but it will have a negligible impact on commute times (as referenced in the extensive literature on the subject). Most of all, it would be a waste of money and a disruption to commuters. Much of this work was just completed (eg University Ave) at great expense and disruption. As it stands, I will not consider voting for this government in an upcoming election based on this matter and other interference in municipal affairs. This government's actions are not conservative, just populist and counterproductive.\n"

Improve the ttc, improve bike lanes, do not remove them to save someone 1 minute on their way to work. Safety over everything. When gas prices were at all time highs the regular car drivers relied more on the ttc I would rather see an investment in transit and bike lanes than a reduction in time in a car. I am someone who drives trucks for deliveries as part of my income and drive using car shares. Yet I still heavily rely on bike lanes and other transit. Biking promotes health and is good for society. I will stop biking if I don\u2019t feel safe. Promote biking and have less cars on the road that way we can speed up commutes and promote healthy lifestyles.\n"
