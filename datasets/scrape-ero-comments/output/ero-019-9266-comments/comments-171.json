        "comment": "Bill 212 in Ontario has sparked significant controversy and concern among various groups, particularly regarding its implications for the rights of workers and the environment. Critics argue that the bill primarily serves the interests of large corporations and property owners, allowing them to operate with fewer regulations at the expense of public welfare.\nBy relaxing key regulatory frameworks, Bill 212 can create an environment where profit takes precedence over community well-being and accountability. This shift raises questions about the potential for increased exploitation of workers, degradation of environmental standards, and diminished oversight that ensures public safety. Rather than prioritizing the needs of Ontarians or fostering a fair economic landscape, the bill appears to cater predominantly to the desires of big owners seeking to maximize their profits with minimal constraints.\nMoreover, such legislative moves often lead to a consolidation of power and wealth among a select few, sidelining the voices of everyday citizens who rely on strong regulations for their livelihoods and health. The focus on deregulation under Bill 212 underscores a troubling trend where the interests of the few overshadow the needs of the many, ultimately threatening the fabric of communities across Ontario.\n"

        "comment": "This proposed bill is not evidence based and is clearly contrived. It has been demonstrated repeatedly that bike infrastructure reduces congestion (see London, Paris, Montreal, Amsterdam, Copenhagen, etc.). The solution to gridlock is less cars on the road through safe and affordable alternatives. Active transportation infrastructure addresses this issue but a major lack of investment and vision for public transportation is the root cause of gridlock. Austerity, lack of vision, and running transit as a business rather than a public service has caused this problem. As our population and density increases, there simply is not enough space for everyone to drive a single passenger vehicle to get around. This government should be focused on real solutions going forward to improve the lives of their constituents rather than contriving  emotional wedge issues to help secure uninformed votes. Do better. Learn to actually care about the future of this country and the wellbeing of its citizens rather than petty partisan and political self-interest for once.\n"

        "comment": "As a Toronto resident of M4E2J3, it's astounding how a piece of legislation could be so utterly backwards. Bike lanes are an essential part of the traffic system. They provide safety for cyclists from cars while giving pedestrians full access to walkways; they relieve traffic tensions from vehicles needing to avoid slower moving travellers; they provide a simple means of transporting short distances within the city, which reduces the overall number of vehicles in the downtown core; and in full saturation provide greater traffic density and overall speeds.\nHow you have been able to draft something so unbelievably ill-conceived and misrepresented I can only hope is the result of a staggering amount of stupidity and not the sheer malice and contempt it would otherwise require.\nThis is to say nothing of the anti-environment regulations that are trying to be slipped through for a disastrous 413 project. Do it right or not at all.\nShould you require more information on the topic of bike access in traffic, please see every study conducted in the last 50 years and most of Europe.\n"

        "comment": "I have been a cyclist all my life, both in the rural community where I grew up, in Toronto where I attended college, and in the town I now live in Waterloo region.\nFor many years, I was even a 4 season cyclist.\nBike lanes are an essential part of infrastructure for the safety of all people - where there aren't safe bike lanes, those that ride bikes will instead prefer sidewalks rather than roads, as increasingly aggressive and distracted drivers endanger themselves, vulnerable roadway users such as cyclists, other drivers, and pedestrians.\nWidening roads will not alleviate congestion - instead, wider roads will attract more drivers, inducing the demand on that roadway until the level of congestion is the same as it was before.\nWidening roads will instead make the city roads lacking bike lanes impassable or lethally dangerous for thousands of bike, ebike, scooter, escooter, and mobility scooter users.\nThere have already been 30 deaths on Toronto roads in 2024 alone. 12 of those are pedestrians and 6 are cyclists.\nBike ridership has only increased, as vehicle ownership costs increase, and as people strive for active commutes that form an integral part of a healthy and sustainable lifestyle.\nThe removal of bike lanes is a terrible idea, as it will make the commutes of thousands of people less safe and ultimately guarantee a higher casualty rate.\nThere was a 38% decline in the rate of cyclist-motor vehicle collisions per cyclist-month after the addition of bike lanes in a given area of Toronto specifically. That same area experienced 2.6x more cyclist ridership after the addition of bike lanes, some of which directly led to a decrease in motor-vehicle traffic on the same streets, just by the availability of safe cycling infrastructure.\n"

        "comment": "Cities are not made for commuting one\u2019s car through. Cities are vibrant places to live, conduct business, go to school, and form community. Bike lanes have proven time and time again they increase business to stores on their routes. More lanes in roads have proven time and time again that they do not improve traffic in the end. Wholistic health including pollution, the environment, community, excercise etc is all improved with bike lanes.\nMore lanes of traffic only increase pedestrian deaths and the noise negatively impacts businesses on their routes. Also, all the people who currently bike due to the simplicity of this bike lane network will be forced into cars further creating gridlock.\nI am considered an undecided voter, I was very pleased with the Ontario governments improvements to public transit including the Ontario Line subway. It provides people with options other than driving, and helps improve traffic for those who are driving.  If this is passed, I will do everything in my power to keep the Ontario conservatives from being reelected through my own vote and interactions with my peers. This is something I am the most passionate about, as well as growing number of young people. This is setting Ontario back many years.\n"

        "comment": "\"We have to do everything we can to make sure there\u2019s never a death in the city. One death is way too many when it comes to bicycle riders. We have to make sure that they\u2019re safe.\"\nThat was the Premier back in 2017 on TVO's Political Blind Date. \u201cYou\u2019re nervous when there\u2019s no bike lanes. At least I was,\u201d he said. And I agree.\nI am deeply concerned about rumoured provincial legislation leaked in a CBC report back on September 19th that would limit building new (and possibly remove existing) bike lanes. This represents a massive overreach that would effectively limit the toolkit my municipal government has to address issues that are important to me like cleaner air, eliminating serious injuries and fatalities from traffic collisions, and even tackling gridlock and congestion woes. That the Premier, the Minister of Transportation, and the Minister of Infrastructure have all refused to deny this is being actively considered is extremely unsettling.\nMunicipal governments have the local knowledge and contextual understanding necessary to effectively address specific community transportation needs. Any provincial legislation that would limit municipalities from serving their communities ultimately undermines local governance and the ability of municipalities to protect the well-being of their residents. All levels of government have a clear public health obligation to ensure roadways are safe for all users.\nFrom a recent Ipsos poll commissioned by the Toronto Region Board of Trade, 86% of respondents agree that there is a traffic and congestion crisis in the region. But when asked about the causes of congestion, folks can plainly see what\u2019s right in front of them: 68% say too much construction and mismanagement of construction schedules, and 57% say too many cars and trucks on the road. Only 21% say the main reason for traffic congestion is due to \u201cother on-street uses (e.g. bike lanes, parking, CafeTO)\u201d. To be clear, that\u2019s not even 21% blaming just bike lanes. That number includes concerns about on-street parking and business-boosting initiatives like streetside patios and cafes. Even with bike lanes consistently and without evidence being scapegoated, the majority of folks refuse to take the bait.\nI urge you to reject making my safety (and my loved ones\u2019 safety) a pawn in a larger culture war. Riding a bike is not a left-right issue. In Toronto alone, six people have been killed riding their bikes so far this year\u2013more than the previous three years combined. The timing of this all is deeply invalidating to everyone who has lost a friend or family member in a traffic collision. Bike lanes save lives. Not every trip will be bikeable, and not every person will choose to ride a bike. But let\u2019s use evidence-based solutions to keep people moving across the province, and not take away the democratic voices of my municipal leaders and my community\n"

        "comment": "To whom it may concern,\nI write to express my complete opposition to the recent decision to remove existing bike lanes across the province.  I will specifically speak to my experience in Toronto where I am currently a medical student. Bike lanes are the fastest most convenient way of getting around the city, they help to reduce traffic overall, and they support the overall health of the city.\nAs part of my program, we rotate through different hospitals in Toronto. I own a car and live in close proximity to a subway station, and yet I choose to bike everyday. I use the bike lanes along Yonge and Bloor street twice a day to get to my rotations. Biking is the fastest way to get around the city. By bike, my commute is 27 minutes versus 59 minute by TTC (assuming that there are no traffic delays, emergency alarms, or trespassers on the platform-- which is a rarity), and 30-50 minutes by car depending on traffic (notably,  my current hospital does not have sufficient parking to accommodate staff driving). Consequently, biking is the only practical option and I am not alone in that conclusion. Everyday, I see numerous people making use of these bike lanes on their daily commute. While the number of people biking will be reduced if bike infrastructure is removed, many people (including myself) will continue to bike the same route, taking up entire lanes. This will massively slow traffic and will frustrate drivers further. It is also incredibly unsafe for cyclists.\nI hear the argument that traffic is a big problem across the province. Removing bike lanes in Toronto will not improve traffic, it will make it worse. The bike lanes in Toronto are heavily trafficked year-round. Removing these bike lanes will bring more people to the roads in cars or to the TTC, both of which are already at capacity. Increasing the number of lanes on a road will do nothing if you are also increasing the number of cars on the road. Moreover, you can expect that any lane added at the expense of a bike lane will be used for street parking. Look to any two lane street in the city and you will see traffic having to be diverted as delivery drivers and ubers sit idle in a lane. This is something that already frequently occurs in bike lanes illegally across the city. What is to stop them from doing the same in the new traffic lanes?\nFinally, as a medical student, I think a lot about the health of our population. I see sick people struggling with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, neurocognitive challenges, and mental illness everyday. If you look at the guidelines for disease prevention across all of these health conditions, the one common recommendation is exercise. Guidelines recommend 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous activity per week. I meet those targets every week simply by cycling to work. In a province where our healthcare system in crumbling, we need to think about the long term health of our population. Offering safe ways for people to make healthy choices and get more regular exercise will ultimately improve the overall health of our population and reduce the burden on our healthcare system.\nI truly hope you will consider this plea. The bike lanes in Toronto are part of what make it so magical. I appreciate that not every city in the province is designed in a way where bike lanes make sense, but in a city as densely populated as Toronto, infrastructure that supports alternative forms of transportation is critical.\nThank you for your consideration.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal to prioritize car lanes over bike lanes is not grounded in any evidence or research, only polling by the PC Party.\nIt also doesn\u2019t take into account efforts to reduce GHG and promote active transportation (for pubic health and the environment).  It also puts cyclists at greater risk of injury from bigger and bigger vehicles.\nFurthermore, decisions related to roads (for cars, buses, bicycles, etc) are made based on extensive municipal research and consultation at the community level. Why would the provincial ministry think it can have more knowledge of local issues ?\nThanks for the opportunity to comment\n"

        "comment": "I personally think Bill 212  is a ridiculous idea and a total overreach by the Provincial government and that these decision should be made by local municipalities. We need to give people who live in more populated areas of the province alternative ways to navigate the cities that does not involve adding more vehicles and that is safe for those who choose those alternatives. Many people are choosing cycling for health reasons, for financial reasons or maybe for green reasons and they should be able to do it safely. Maybe you should be looking at how the Netherlands or even cities in BC are promoting cycling and making it safe. There are too many selfish, impatient drivers out there and too many pedestrians/cyclists being hit. This is unacceptable.\n"
