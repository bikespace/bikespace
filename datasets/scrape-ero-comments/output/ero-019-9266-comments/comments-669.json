        "comment": "It's important to realize that the estimate of 1.2% of bike riders is incorrect.  The number of riders in downtown Toronto is closer to 10%.  If every one of those bikes was a car, just think of the traffic congestion and also the increased carbon emissions.\nSince the bike lanes have been added, biking is safer.  Whole families bike together safely.  Forcing bikes, especially with young children, to ride in car traffic is very dangerous.  The only alternative, then, is for bikes to ride on the sidewalk, which is inconvenient and dangerous for pedestrians.\nThe proposal is a waste of money, will be dangerous, and the gridlock of the deconstruction will take a long time, causing more delay.\nPlease listen to the people of Toronto.\n"

It\u2019s created a safer situation for both cyclists and pedestrians as well as reduced traffic by helping people choose alternative methods of transits. Removing current and limiting future bike lanes would be a waste of tax payer funds and a move in the wrong direction for the city and the province.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is a dreadful idea, for two reasons. First, bike lanes segregate bike and car traffic, which reduces accidents and promotes cycling, which is good from public health and climate change perspectives. When I drive, I like to have cyclists in a separate lane, where I don't have to worry about them.\nSecond, the province should give cities the autonomy to decide these (and most other) matters themselves. Toronto and Timmins may come to different answers on a given question and that's ok. I doubt the members of the Ford government would approve if a future non-Conservative government were to intrude on municipal autonomy to promote various progressive causes.\nBut let's not fool ourselves. This is a wedge issue designed to secure the votes of drivers who are frustrated by congestion. It's not going to help with congestion and will only waste money and put cyclists' lives at risk. The government should be ashamed of itself for putting forward this legislation.\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nI am deeply concerned about the government's plan to remove bike lanes without presenting any evidence or data to justify this decision. The burden of proof lies with the government, yet so far, no supporting studies, data, or expert opinions have been shared to validate these claims. Simply repeating that it is \"common sense\" that bike lanes are an issue is insufficient. Governance should not be based on vague assertions but on clear evidence, rigorous studies, and a well-defined vision\u2014none of which have been demonstrated in this case.\nWhen evaluating the effectiveness of a drug, for example, we rely on research, not \"common sense.\" Similarly, before adopting a new approach, it is essential to substantiate claims with facts and analysis. To date, no such evidence has been provided.\nI urge you to prioritize transparency and data-driven decision-making before proceeding with this initiative.\nThank you\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to Bill 212, which proposes the removal of bike lanes in Ontario. This bill, if passed, would have significant negative impacts on the environment, public health, and the quality of life in our communities.\nFirst, bike lanes are essential for reducing traffic congestion and encouraging sustainable, eco-friendly transportation. Removing them would not only increase reliance on cars but also contribute to higher emissions, worsening air quality and exacerbating the climate crisis. We need to prioritize greener forms of transportation, not eliminate them. Bike lanes are a key component of building more sustainable cities and reducing our carbon footprint.\nIn addition, bike lanes contribute to public health by encouraging physical activity. Cycling is a low-impact exercise that helps reduce obesity, heart disease, and other health problems. By removing bike lanes, we undermine the public health benefits that these spaces provide, pushing people back into cars and contributing to a more sedentary lifestyle.\nMoreover, bike lanes enhance safety. Studies show that cities with well-designed cycling infrastructure have lower accident rates, both for cyclists and pedestrians. Removing bike lanes would put vulnerable road users at greater risk, leading to more injuries and deaths.\nFinally, while Bill 212 proposes to remove bike lanes, it\u2019s important to consider the financial implications. The funds that would be used for reversing bike lane installations could be better allocated to addressing more urgent issues such as affordable housing, mental health services, and community infrastructure. With the growing housing crisis in Ontario, redirecting resources toward housing development would provide a far greater long-term benefit to the public than dismantling bike lanes.\nFor the sake of our environment, public health, safety, and overall quality of life, I urge you to oppose Bill 212 and to prioritize policies that foster sustainable urban development, protect vulnerable road users, and address our province's housing needs.\n"

        "comment": "To whom it may concern:\nOh boy.  This is a really power-centric bill.  There is NO GOOD reason to get this bill passed.  The provincial government needs to let the municipalities decide their future \u2026 not the provincial government!!\nThis is a bill that pulls rank and is an example of PROVINCIAL OVERREACH over municipalities that have spent time, energy, money to plan their cities/towns.  There has also been lots of input from residents in the areas for these bike lanes.   There has been money spent on consultants.  What makes the provincial government know what constituents want in these towns and cities?  At present, municipalities have the authority to design and install bicycle lanes on roads under their jurisdiction based on their OWN priorities and transportation context. This bill is provincial overreach into municipal decision-making. This is a very ill-advised bill.  How bout something that gets transit built on time and within budget?  Why are we spending money to get a bill to undo what is done?  Municipalities have not budgeted for this, and even if the province picks up the tab, ripping out functional transportation infrastructure is not fiscally responsible. My goodness you know how to waste time and money!!!  How bout spending time on pressing issues with climate change \u2026 more efficient, green transit instead of highways like the 413.  We need to move away from car-centric plans and elevate and change our habits \u2026 like better transit and more bikes on the roads.  Cars cause congestion and are polluters \u2026 not bikes.\nBikes \u2026\nBike lanes are an incredibly efficient way of moving people and are able to move many more people per hour than a lane focused primary on moving motor vehicles.  Bike lanes help to provide transportation choice, which helps to reduce the overall number of motor vehicles on the road. Just as highways result in more car trips, bike lanes increase cycling trips.  Bike lanes save lives, and help to make our roads safer for everyone, including people in motor vehicles.  Bikes are better for our health with fresh air and exercise \u2026 reducing the risk of chronic disease, reducing stress, and improving mental health.\nSo please \u2026 keep your hands off our roads/bike lanes.  My husband and I have sat and spent time with others giving input to look at traffic patterns \u2026 making sure traffic flow is not affected \u2026 but by making cyclists safe \u2026 not sure the provincial government would do any of this .. and its being done by the municipalities.  YOU DO NOT NEED to proceed with this bill \u2026 spend time on issues that are going to make a difference and are under the umbrella of the provincial government.\nThank you for listening.\n"

        "comment": "I am a constituent and daily car driver in the Scarborough-Agincourt riding (093) and I strongly oppose the Ontario government's Bill 212 to remove existing bike lanes and obstruct future bike lane construction. Study after study has shown not only the POSITIVE economic effects of bike lanes on local neighborhoods but that it REDUCES overall traffic congestion, and improves emergency response times.\nBill 212 ignores all this evidence supporting bike lanes while touting it's goal of reducing traffic congestion. This is absurd.\nFurther, this is a vast over reach of municipal jurisdiction to govern their own affairs. Local planning decisions must be left to their elected officials at the municipality level, and not at the provincial level. I demand the withdrawal of this Bill. We will remember your actions and that of others come next provincial election.\n"

As an artist, my income is disproportional to the contributions artists like me make to the multi billion dollar tourism industry. I neither own a car, nor a house. My bike is not for \u201cleisure\u201d solely, it is my primary means of transportation.\nRemoving infrastructure for an environmentally friendly mode of transportation in favour of a polluting one such as the private car is the sort of backward thinking we cannot afford at this stage of the climate emergency. Rather than removing them, I\u2019d like to see them enhanced with trees planted to protect cyclist from motor traffic. I\u2019d like the bike lanes to be reserved for the exclusive use of non-motorized vehicles.\nThank you!\n"

        "comment": "I am inspired by the people in Copenhagen - a city similar in climate to Toronto. \"Copenhageners cycle an estimated 1.44 million kilometres daily. 49% of all trips to work or school in Copenhagen are by bike, up from 35% just ten years ago. This recent rise in cycling over the past decade is a result of continued municipal investment.\"\nThree years ago I was a fair weather cyclist - only in the summer. Now with the improved, safe bike lanes I look forward to my 4 km commute each way - that I make in all weather.\nWe are giving up on creating a bike culture before we've even tried. The bike lanes are new! If in 10 years we've seen no growth THEN have the discussion about cars and traffic. Giving up on this infrastructure before it's complete is like cutting off your nose to save your face.\nI'm not a young hipster - I'm just north of 50, female and work as an executive. Rather than ask what can we do to improve car traffic, ask what can we do to build our own version of Copenhagen Cycle Culture??\n"

        "comment": "I am very concerned about the removal of the bike lanes in this bill. But, I am also concerned - perhaps even more so - about the overriding of the Environmental Assessment Act for building Highway 413. It is a travesty to suggest that it is okay to do an environmental assessment AFTER starting the early works (which involves heavy construction) and land appropriation for the project. This means the environmental assessment will be merely a formality, rather than actually informing the project in any way. Highways are one of the largest scale infrastructures that can be built, which is exactly why a thorough environmental assessment should be performed BEFORE construction (including early works) begins, as stipulated clearly in the EAA.\n"
