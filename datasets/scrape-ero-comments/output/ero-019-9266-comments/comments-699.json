        "comment": "I strongly oppose this proposed bill. It will negatively impact the City of Toronto and Ontario residents with limited benefits.\nThis proposal will:\nIncrease red tape and bureaucracy: By imposing unnecessary regulations, it will slow down municipal decision-making processes and hinder efficient service delivery. Municipalities are best served to make informed choices on where and how to implement bike lanes. Provincial oversight in this space is an overreach that will reap limited benefits and instead stall municipal development.\nUndermine safety: While the intent may be to prioritize drivers, this proposal could inadvertently lead to less safe conditions. By focusing on maximizing the number of cars on the road, it disregards the importance of alternative transportation modes like cycling. Without bike lanes, cyclists are forced to drive alongside cars - creating dangerous situations for both parties.\nHinder essential transportation: Cycling is a crucial mode of transportation, especially for commuters and those living in urban areas. Safe bike infrastructure supports transit connections and promotes sustainable, environmentally friendly travel. Bloor, Yonge & University are key city arteries, that with effective urban infrastructure, can serve more city commuters than just those with the privilege of owning a vehicle.\nI urge the government to reconsider this proposal and instead support initiatives that promote safe and efficient transportation for all, including cyclists. By investing in bike infrastructure and encouraging active transportation, we can create healthier, more sustainable, and safer communities.\n"

        "comment": "We should be spending this money on something that makes sense, like healthcare or education or more public transit.\nWe need more bike lanes, not fewer. Spending $50 million on undoing one of the things that has been a great help to the people of Toronto is illogical. Bike lanes make people safer, and biking makes people healthier. Rising cost of living means people are looking for ways to cut costs, and cycling is a great way to save money. Those benefits are great for individuals, but they\u2019re also great for the city.\nI drive, cycle, walk and take TTC. TTC is sometimes the third most efficient way to travel, cycling is sometimes faster. We should be investing in public transit improvements.\nPeople often choose to drive because it\u2019s the quickest, but this is creating more gridlock and traffic and pollution. But if it takes me an hour to take TTC somewhere, and 20 minutes to drive, it makes sense to save the time. We need better transit\u2014take $50 million and invest it there! I would choose TTC more often if it was better and less crowded.\nThe more people we can get on bikes and taking transit, the better.\n"

        "comment": "I'm sorry, in what world is spending an estimated $48 million in additional costs to provincial taxpayers for the removal of bike lanes on major Toronto streets a smart idea? We're just pissing money away. Are there not countless other ways this money could be spent to improve the day-to-day lives of Torontonians. Like on improving the TTC conditions so folks who don't drive can actually rely on our transportation system? Like building shelters to help people move out of park encampments? Or what about that talk-o-the-town affordable housing?\nWhen the weather behaves, I use the Bloor bike lanes multiple times a week to get to work\u2014and let me tell you, there's heavy bike traffic. Do you think us cyclists are just going to walk to work instead? No, we're not. We're going to become more entangled in traffic, there will be more tragic accidents, and there will be even more of an us-against-them mentality. I don't want it to be bikes versus cars; I think most of us have been on both sides of the coin and are understanding of the other perspective. But when fairweather cyclists feel less safe on the roads and they own cars, which one do you think they'll reach for over the other? And which one will take up MORE space on the roads? Removing the bike lanes simply doesn't make sense; it will have the opposite effect.\n"

With climate change escalating and our fossil fuel addiction out of control, bike lanes are part of the solution, not the problem.

Instead of tearing them out, we should be doubling down on efforts to make our cities greener, healthier, and less reliant on gas-guzzling cars.\n"

I had \"Bike Lanes on Bloor\" stickers for years on both my bike and on my car.\nI feel safe cycling in them, and I feel safe driving next to them, because the cyclists are protected from me and the other drivers.\nHow dare the Ford government threaten to get rid of them? At a cost \u2013 to the taxpayers, of course \u2013 higher than the cost of building them. It will save little or no time for drivers, and it will cost lives.\nSomeday they will be rebuilt. Just like the Eglinton subway. Remember how a previous Conservative government not only stopped building it, but filled it in?\nBike deliveries have been our salvation in the middle of construction \u2013 and construction we have always with us.\nAnd: I just made a sign to wear when cycling. It says ZERO EMISSIONS. I saw an electric delivery cart labeled \"Zero Emissions,\" and I thought, That's not exactly true. But for a cyclist it is exactly true. I'm not sure how to attach a photo, but you'll see it at a rally very soon.\nThen there's Highway 413, a waste of money and an attack on our environment. And our water. It would take a huge bite out of the Greenbelt. It would destroy thousands of homes. It would destroy important natural heritage. It would mean no consultation with Indigenous communities (so much for Truth and Reconciliation).\nAnd it would eviscerate the provincial environmental assessment procedure. Many years ago, I was on the team that got the Environmental Assessment Act written and adopted.\nWe who want to protect the environment have to win every time. The people who want to destroy it only have to win once.\n"

        "comment": "As a resident of Toronto and a student of urbanism, I urge you to reconsider the provisions in Bill 212 that may lead to the removal of bike lanes in our city. This measure jeopardizes the safety and well-being of some of our most vulnerable populations, including children, seniors, delivery workers, and underprivileged groups, who rely on cycling as a safe and affordable mode of transportation.\n The following Key Points on Bike Safety and the Importance of Dedicated Bike Lanes explain why:\n- Safety for All Ages, Especially Children\nDedicated bike lanes provide a safe space for children to commute to school or recreational activities without the risk of sharing lanes with high-speed vehicle traffic. Studies consistently show that separated cycling infrastructure significantly reduces accidents and injuries, creating a safer environment for families. Removing bike lanes forces young cyclists into more dangerous conditions, potentially deterring families from choosing active transportation.\n-Protection Through Traffic Separation\nResearch demonstrates that physically separated bike lanes\u2014those with barriers or buffers\u2014are vital for reducing collisions and increasing cyclist confidence. Without these lanes, cyclists, especially children, face increased vulnerability in shared spaces with motor vehicles. Retaining these lanes is crucial to prevent avoidable injuries and fatalities.\n- Encouraging Safe and Equitable Transportation Options\nBike lanes are not just for recreational use; they serve as essential infrastructure for economically disadvantaged groups who may rely on bicycles as their primary mode of transportation. Removing bike lanes undermines these individuals' ability to travel safely and equitably, widening social and economic disparities.\n-Data Supporting Bike Lane Effectiveness\nCities with robust bike lane networks consistently report fewer cyclist injuries and fatalities. Investments in such infrastructure are proven to enhance public safety and encourage more residents to adopt cycling, leading to healthier and more sustainable communities.\n-Creating a Livable, Family-Friendly City\nToronto has made strides in fostering a more inclusive and accessible urban environment. Removing bike lanes is a step backward, sending a message that safety and sustainability are not priorities. Instead, maintaining and expanding cycling infrastructure aligns with our shared goals of reducing congestion, promoting environmental responsibility, and enhancing quality of life for all residents.\nI strongly encourage the committee to prioritize the safety and needs of our communities by retaining and improving the city's bike lanes. Let us build a Toronto that is safe, sustainable, and accessible for all, especially our most vulnerable residents.\nThank you\nReferences :\nDill, J. (2009).

        "comment": "This proposed legislation will not save me any time as a taxpayer in Ontario. My family does not own a car: we commute to work, take our kid to daycare, do groceries, run errands, go to appointments - all by bike or as pedestrians. Allowing bike lanes to be reduced at a time when alternative means of transportation that improve congestion by taking cars off the road should be encouraged, not discouraged. I believe numerous studies and real-life examples have made it clear that adding more car lanes or preventing the removal of car lanes does not ultimately solve congestion, which will continue to plague us until we have the courage to consider, fund, promote, and provide a safe framework for, realistic alternatives. Indirectly, this proposed legislation creates an adversarial, either/or relationship between cycling and driving, pitting Ontarians against one another and suggesting that the convenience, \"time-saving,\" and safety of one group is more important than any other.\n"

        "comment": "As a resident of the Province of Ontario and the City of Toronto, I strongly oppose the proposed framework for bike lanes and the removal of existing bike lanes in Toronto. These policies run counter to evidence-based best practices for urban mobility and environmental sustainability. I urge the government to reconsider this approach and work collaboratively with municipalities to create a comprehensive and effective transportation system that prioritizes safety, reduces congestion, supports local economies and promotes cleaner air.\n1. Safety for Cyclists and Other Road Users:\nThe proposed framework would significantly compromise the safety of cyclists. Dedicated bike lanes provide a physical barrier between cyclists and motor vehicles, reducing the risk of collisions and fatalities. Eliminating these lanes forces cyclists back into mixed traffic environments, increasing their vulnerability and potentially leading to more accidents. This not only harms cyclists but also creates a more stressful driving experience for motorists.\nIn addition, the removal of dedicated bike lanes often forces cyclists to ride on sidewalks, creating a dangerous situation for pedestrians, particularly children and individuals with disabilities. This puts pedestrians at risk of collisions and injuries.\n2. Traffic Congestion:\nTraffic congestion is a complex issue, but research shows that well-designed bike lanes can actually improve traffic flow. By encouraging cycling as a viable transportation option, bike lanes reduce the number of cars on the road, thereby alleviating congestion. Additionally, studies indicate that cyclists often reach their destinations faster than cars in congested areas.\nIn addition, the concept of induced demand suggests that increased road capacity can lead to increased traffic. As more people choose to drive, the additional lanes will quickly become filled, and congestion will return. In contrast, bike lanes encourage cycling, a mode of transportation that doesn't contribute to traffic congestion.\nWell-designed bike lanes can also improve traffic flow by creating more predictable and efficient traffic patterns. By prioritizing sustainable transportation options, we can create more efficient and resilient urban environments.\n3. Importance of Bike Lanes for Reducing Carbon Emissions:\nClimate change is a pressing concern, and promoting environmentally friendly transportation is essential. Bike lanes encourage a shift towards cycling, which produces zero emissions. This can significantly contribute to a reduction of Ontario's carbon emissions and lead to a cleaner environment for all citizens.\n4. Economic Benefits of Bike Lanes:\nBike lanes not only benefit individual cyclists and the environment but also contribute to the economic vitality of communities. Studies have shown that bike lanes can significantly increase foot traffic and sales for businesses located on streets with bike lanes.\nA study conducted in the City of Toronto found that bike lanes had a positive impact on local businesses and residents on Bloor Street and on Danforth Avenue. This is similar to impacts seen in other jurisdictions. A study by Portland State University found that bike lanes can have a positive economic impact on several cities in the US, with examples of increased retail employment and food sales after installation of bike lanes.\nBy making streets more accessible and attractive to cyclists, bike lanes can help revitalize local economies, support small businesses, and create vibrant, livable communities.\n5. Inappropriate Provincial Overreach:\nThe proposed framework represents an overreach of provincial authority. Municipalities have the expertise and knowledge to plan and manage their own transportation infrastructure, including bike lanes. Removing this control undermines local decision-making and disregards the specific needs of different communities.\n6. Fiscal Irresponsibility of Removing Bike Lanes:\nRemoving already installed bike lanes would be a fiscally irresponsible decision. The millions in cost to remove bike lanes, including the cost of construction, maintenance, and potential legal challenges, would far outweigh any potential benefits. These funds could be better allocated to essential public services such as healthcare and education. Investing in sustainable transportation infrastructure is a long-term investment that can yield significant returns in terms of public health, economic growth, and environmental sustainability.\nConclusion:\nI urge the Ontario government to:\n- Withdraw the proposed framework for bike lanes.\n- Re-evaluate the planned removal of existing bike lanes in Toronto.\n- Work collaboratively with municipalities to develop a comprehensive strategy for safe, efficient, and sustainable transportation that prioritizes cycling infrastructure.\n"

        "comment": "I am deeply concerned about Bill 212 and its potential impact on urban mobility. While I understand the government\u2019s focus on reducing traffic congestion, removing bike lanes undermines efforts to address this. Bike lanes provide a safe space for cyclists, encouraging more people to bike rather than drive, which reduces the number of cars on the road, eases congestion, lowers pollution, and shortens commute times.\nIf these bike lanes are removed, cyclists will simply ride in regular traffic lanes, which contradicts the bill\u2019s original intention of improving traffic flow. This could make roads less safe and potentially increase congestion.\nBike lanes also promote healthier lifestyles and contribute to a more sustainable, eco-friendly transportation system. Rather than removing them, the focus should be on creating a balanced transportation network that supports both vehicles and cyclists. My colleagues, friends, and family are strongly opposed to Bill 212, and we urge the Ontario government to reconsider this proposal.\n"

Not enough bikes on bike lines, specially in winter and spring time, when is cold, rain, snow, early dark. Driving cars take over too long, pollution ?  Driving on side streets is very slow, drivers take them more and more. Bikers ride bikes without lights, don't obey traffic signals, have over too much rights and no respect to drivers and pedestrians. Cars are still number one transportation option, and TTC. Some deaths might be avoided if bikers respected big vehicles, get off and walk bike and wait.\nMake traveling by cars more efficient, faster, least time on the road. If you work at the office are you going to wear same clothing for riding bike and work in the office? Riding bike 30minutes needs very fit person, work nine hours and again 30 minutes min back. Work at home , too! Bike has to be very good, too! Make public numbers of bikes per hour, per day, per street, per weather conditions, season ! You are giving them over too much rights. Winter is here and you are planning bike lines on Parkside !!! Driving off highway North is already one line, takes very careful driving, specially in dark!!! South are highways!!! Do you plan make bike lines on highways, too!!!\n"
