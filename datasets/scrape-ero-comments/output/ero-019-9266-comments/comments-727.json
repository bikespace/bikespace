Riding in a bike lane allows me much more safety and peace of mind.\nI am so proud of the progress of Toronto has made as a more cyclist-friendly city. We need to continue prioritizing more bike lanes everywhere for our health, safety and accessibility.\nReducing bike lanes at anytime is a such a huge, costly step backwards. Adding more cars to the roads is a climate disaster. We need to share the space fairly.\nThank you, Mayor Chow, for your stand for keeping our bike lanes.\nLet\u2019s continue keeping Toronto a forwarding-thinking and world class city.\n"

        "comment": "Dear Premier Ford, Minister Sarkaria, and MPPs,\nI am writing to express my strong opposition to your proposed Bill 212. I am opposed to this\nlegislation for the following reasons;\n1. Safety: Removing separated cycling lanes from busy roads makes cyclists and all road\nusers unsafe. When cyclists (and other micromobility users such as E-Scooters which I am\ncollectively referring to as \u201ccyclists\" and \u201cbikes\u201d) find that the road is too unsafe they will\nuse the sidewalk. This is extremely unsafe for pedestrians and cyclists alike. Pedestrians,\nparticularly seniors, people with disabilities, children, and people walking pets, are not able\nto move out of the way of cyclists or they step unwittingly into the path of cyclists. In many\ncases one or the other is forced to step out onto the roadway in order to avoid a collision.\nThese incidents result in serious injuries to both pedestrians and cyclists, and they make\npeople, particularly seniors and the disabled, afraid to walk. Further, separated cycling\nlanes make the roads safer for cars because they do not come into conflict with cyclists\nwho are trying to navigate roads that are riddled with obstacles, such as sewer grates,\ndebris, parked cars etc. that require that they move into live tra\ufb03c lanes. If avoiding\ngridlock, rather than safety is your primary goal, then I would point out that motor vehicle\ncollisions, and collisions with other road users are a major factor in causing said gridlock;\n2. Local Decision-Making: Local communities, including City and Regional Councils,\nunderstand the nature and cultures of their communities better than the Province, and are\nbetter able to make decisions that are responsive to the wants and needs of all of their\nresidents. They also engage in extensive consultations throughout the planning process to\ntry to address, as best as possible, the needs of a diverse group of their residents. I am\nquite aware of how the planning process works in the City of Kitchener and Waterloo\nRegion, and that there were, and are, extensive consultations regarding the installation of\ncycling infrastructure, including separated cycling lanes, in our community. That a few\npeople are unhappy with them is no justification for the Province to intervene. In a\ndemocracy such as ours, if the majority of people disagree they have the mechanism of the\nballot box to voice their opinion;\n3; Environmental and Climate Change: Not only are cars significant contributors to\ngreenhouse gasses, air and water pollution, and overall environmental degradation, so is\nthe construction, maintenance, repair of roads. Encouraging people to use alternate means\nof transportation is critical if we are to even begin to address the imminent collapse of the\nsystems that keep us alive. Bicycle lanes encourage provide people to ride bicycles and\npedestrians to walk on city city sidewalks by providing safe zones away from cars in which\nto do so;\n4; Bureaucracy: Your government ran on a platform of reducing \u201cred tape.\u201d Now you wish for\nthe provincial government to interfere in matters of local jurisdiction by putting another level\nof review and approval requirements on local and planning decisions, thereby increasing\ncosts for taxpayers across this Province, and delaying planning decisions for local\ngovernments;\n5; Health: it has been demonstrably proven that people who are active are physically and\nmentally healthier than those who are not. Providing safe cycling lanes encourages people,\nincluding children, to cycle, Given the crisis in our health care system, encouraging people\nto be active should be a top priority;\n6; Equity: Vast numbers of people are not able to a\ufb00ord a car or have an ability or desire to\ndrive. This proposed legislation further increases the inequity that people who do not drive\nface in a society that has the motor vehicle as the primary focus of its transportation policy.\nProviding safe spaces for people to use other means of transportation more safely\nincreases equity;\n7. Costs: Removing separated cycling lanes is going to cost tens to hundreds of millions of\ndollars and, as noted above, implementing a provincial review process is going to add even\nfurther costs for Ontario taxpayers. If reducing gridlock is your true goal, then using that\nmoney on better public transit and commuter rail systems (such as your promise to bring\ntwo-way, all-day GO train service to Waterloo Region) would have far more impact on\nreducing gridlock that removing separated cycling lanes;\n8. Data: There is no data that shows that cycling lanes actually increase gridlock, or that\nremoving them will actually solve the problem. The reason why there is gridlock is that there\nare too many cars on the roads, and if you want to reduce gridlock, the only way to\naccomplish that is to reduce the number of cars; and\n9. Local business and local communities: good cycling and pedestrian infrastructure helps\nfoster local communities and local business. Commuters trying to get from one place to\nanother are far less likely to stop at a local business than are people living in an area who\ncan walk or cycle to that business. People want to live in safe and healthy communities,\nand part of that is ensuring that there are thriving local business for people to patronize.\nCountries, and world-class cities around the globe are building cycling and pedestrian\ninfrastructure, and people in those cities are taking up cycling and transforming the places they\nlive into wonderful, livable, spaces. One only needs to look at places like the Netherlands,\nParis, Copenhagen to see how the decision to move away from a car-centric culture has\nbenefits for everyone. I have spoken with many people in the Netherlands about this, and they\nall say that it was not an easy, or even popular, proposal when the policy was first\nimplemented, but that it was the best thing that their government ever did. Ripping out cycling\ninfrastructure and restricting its constructions is not only a colossal waste of taxpayers\u2019 hard-\nearned money, it is also poor planning that will have absolutely no e\ufb00ect the problem that you\nare trying to solve. Those taxpayer dollars could and should be spent on finding solutions that\nactually work - to wit: reducing the number of cars on the road.\nAll of which is respectfully submitted.\n"

VIA rail is often late and quite costly, buses on the 401 still have to sit in 401 traffic. I just got back from Europe \u2014 they can show you how it\u2019s done.\nThe removal of bike lanes will result in cyclists being injured or killed by motorists.\nAs leaders of the province, it is not okay to ignore best practice and just do what a loud minority wants \u2014 people\u2019s lives are at risk here.\nYou must abandon this bill and look into the actions that will actually result in the reduction of gridlock.\n"

One day, we will take to the streets just like they did in the Netherlands. But that doesn't need to happen if Toronto (and other big Ontario cities) can improve city infrastructure through funding bike lanes and public transit. The [Ford] government only cares about capitol, like cars. Cars suck. Bikes are for the people. Please keep the bike lanes!\n"

Municipalities have the processes to decide on their own infrastructure and should not be subject to additional red tape in trying to make changes in their best interests. The cost and inconvenience of removing established infrastructure is unacceptable especially when we sorely need investments in healthcare and housing. I strongly oppose the framework for bike lanes. We have bigger fish to fry.\nOn top of it all, why does this provincial government keep targeting Toronto and neglecting communities in the rest of the province? Why isn\u2019t there urgent care in Fort Erie or Port Colborne or Minden? This government needs to focus on ALL Ontarians.\n"

They are a great option for all of us city dwellers who cannot afford a car, for those who do not feel comfortable driving in the city, or for those who prefer to commute/explore while getting fresh air and exercise.  Bike lanes keep all cyclists safe and help reduce the amount of cars on the road. Cities that contain multiple modes of alternative transportation such as bike lanes, are known to have happier and healthier communities as well. We do not need more road access, it will not improve the traffic problem within the city. Bike lanes are a better way forward.\n"

        "comment": "The \u201cReducing Gridlock and Saving You Time Act\u201d, which restricts the construction of bike lanes where motor vehicle lanes would be reduced, will have the very opposite effect. The data are clear: facilitating cycling and pedestrian traffic divert drivers to methods of transportation that reduce the number of cars that would otherwise occupy space on roadways. This is a dangerous inititative, evidenced by the number of cyclist fatalities in encounters with motor vehicles. Portraying bike lanes and cycling as a cause of gridlock stokes the growing antipathy towards cyclists. I am a responsible, cautious, and rule-abiding rider who uses a  bike as an alternative to my car, whose safety has been enhanced by the measures implemented to separate cyclists from drivers. Nonetheless, I have been the subject of unprovoked profanity from drivers who yell at me as they speed past, angered, it appears, by my mere presence. Misrepresentation and misinformation contribute to an unnecessarily adversarial, and potentially perilous, relationship between drivers and cyclists. I am also a volunteer with 'Cycling Without Age' (https://cyclingwithoutage.ca/), an internationional organization that uses specially built trishaws to give the cycling exeperience to seniors and people with limited physical and cognitive ability. Again, the data are clear: such opportunities reduce social isolation and contribute to passengers' emotional and psychological health. Bike lanes and paths ensure passenger and pilot safety. This is an equity issue: seniors and people with limited physical mobility would otherwise not be able to enjoy the benefits of cycling: being out and about, experiencing social interaction and conversation, making new friends,etc. Thanks to CWA, they are able to participate in a way that their circumstances would otherwise preclude. Dedicated, safe bike lanes facilitate their social and physical participation in an activity from which they would otherwise be foreclosed.\n"

        "comment": "The proposal to remove three major bike lanes from our city is a shortsighted and dangerous decision that prioritizes convenience for a few over the safety and well-being of many. These bike lanes are not just lines on the road\u2014they are lifelines for thousands of daily cyclists who rely on them to commute safely.\nIn a city where reckless driving and a lack of respect for cyclists already put lives at risk, this move would only exacerbate the problem, leaving more people vulnerable to harm. It is unconscionable to strip away infrastructure that protects vulnerable road users, especially when cities worldwide are investing in sustainable, safe transportation alternatives.\nInstead of removing these critical bike lanes, the province should focus on creating a transportation system that puts civilians\u2019 safety first, fosters inclusivity, and supports eco-friendly commuting. Decisions like these set us back, jeopardizing the progress we've made toward building a safer, more livable city for everyone. I urge the government to reconsider this proposal and listen to the voices of its citizens who demand safer streets, not deadlier ones.\n"
