I enjoy that the cyclists are seperated and kept out of the way of drivers in their own protected lanes. Removing exsiting newly-built and widley used infrastructure is absloutely counterproductive and harmful for the city.

        "comment": "I strongly oppose Bill 212, as it jeopardizes sustainable urban transportation and wastes taxpayer dollars already invested in essential cycling infrastructure. Existing bike lanes on key Toronto streets, such as Bloor, Yonge, and University, have improved commuting options, reduced congestion, and enhanced safety. Removing them not only squanders previous investments but also threatens cyclist safety and community environmental goals. Furthermore, I urge the government to commission an independent study to assess the positive economic impact of bike lanes on local businesses, a benefit already seen in other progressive cities. Prioritizing cars over alternative transportation is a regressive step in Ontario\u2019s future planning. This approach contradicts Ontario\u2019s environmental and public health goals, limiting the province\u2019s progress toward a safer, greener, and more efficient transportation future.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes is a very bad idea. Research shows they aid in reducing congestion (so even if you don't bike yourself, it's still good for you). Plenty of people can't afford a car but can afford a bike and still deserve to be able to get around safely. They have been working very well here and are constantly in use. These days a lot of smaller deliveries also happen on bikes, which means removing them will make a very crucial activity in the city much harder to do and much more dangerous. Even IF removing them was a good idea (and again, it's a disastrously bad one), this overreaching power grab is not an appropriate way to accomplish that. There is no principled reason to do this at all.\n"

Bicycles are not the problem. Vehicle drivers are the problem.\nToo many vehicles on the road is the problem that needs to be managed by increasing funding of public transit as well as building better bicycle lane networks.\nHaving more and more lanes dedicated to vehicles will only increase vehicle usage, damaging the environment with no reduction in driving time or driver frustration. Bicycles will still use the roadways therefore endangering the vulnerable bicycle rider - I guess until the government bans all cycling in Ontaio.\n"

        "comment": "We should be making an effort to reduce car traffic (and thus  reducing emissions, reducing noise, and improving pedestrian/customer traffic to local businesses) by installing more bike lanes and public transportation, rather than increasing traffic, noise, and pollution by adding more car lanes. Time and time again, it has been shown adding more lanes does not improve traffic.\nThe lack of use of some bike lanes is due to a lack of complete bike lane networks. You would rather use a direct route rather than a bunch of side streets and a dirt roads, or even worse, parking lots, parks/lawn, fields etc. with ANY vehicle. When our bike lines start and stop over short distances, of course you are going to see reduced traffic on them. With more complete bike lane networks ridership goes up. Take a look at \"I Can't Believe I Have to Make This Video\" (2:06-5:30) by Oh The Urbanity!, it is a very informative video on the topic of bike lanes that shows Bill 212 is a very ignorant proposal that will waste time and taxpayers money.\nI even bet removing the proposed bike lanes would increase stress on the subway system.\nI would honestly love the opportunity to bike to work! Why don't I? Well the bike lane infrastructure is just not there. Haven't you heard? \"Build it, and they will come.\", \"You can't justify a bridge by the number of people swimming across a river\"-Brent Toderian.\nHey while we're at it, why not get the cars off the street car routes? I bet that would make public transportation more efficient and reduce repair costs. See \"How NOT to build public transit (Toronto's Streetcars)\" (2:10-3:20) by flurfdesign.\nLet's be smart about this and think ahead, cars and urban sprawl are not the way of the future.\n"

        "comment": "Is there any proof or justification that removing bike lanes (or blocking their creation) improves car travel time? Even if there was, is it fair to remove a safe lower-cost option for the sake of saving a few minutes on the road?\nYou could argue that saving a few minutes means that you save some fuel emissions. But the best way by far to reduce fuel emissions is to make cycling a viable option. Not only does this save the fuel from the drive, but also the resources used to build, maintain, and dispose of large vehicles in the first place (not to mention having more potholes to fix).\nYou could argue that it is unsafe to have bike lanes because cyclists are at risk whenever they are on the road. But removing the bike lanes won't remove the cyclists, there will always be someone who has to do it. Though, in a way, it _would_ remove them too, because they will be killed by a motor vehicle.\nMany people have contributed to the bike lanes in Toronto on Yonge, University and Bloor. Not just the construction workers, and not just the taxpayer who funded the changes, but also the people who had to endure the road closures for a long time. We love the bike lanes, and there is no indication whatsoever that they slow down traffic. In fact, they seem to improve traffic because cyclists and cars are no longer fighting for the same space as much as they used to.\n"

Currently we only have a single mode of transportation, which is driving. I don't want to drive everywhere. I want to have options. I want to be able to ride my bike safely. I want to be able to take a train from Hamilton to Toronto. We don't even have trains in the afternoon from Hamilton Go Centre to Toronto right now.

        "comment": "I commute along Avenue Road/University Avenue to work, taking the bus or sometimes walking as the traffic can be agonizingly slow. However, the delays have nothing to do with cyclists or bike lanes. All of the slowdowns are caused by construction projects where developers have taken up lanes (for unbelievable lengths of time), TTC construction projects - which also always move at a insanely glacial pace, and pop up blockages that seem to occur on a different part of Avenue every day.  There are so many positives to Toronto\u2019s bike lane infrastructure, and as a Torontonian, I am very proud of it. Leave any decisions regarding bike lanes with the city where they belong, but it would be great if the Province could work with the city to better regulate traffic blockage due to construction and infrastructure projects.  I\u2019ll attach one picture of a development blockage from this week, but I could send you half a dozen from my 60 min walk in to work, all creating bottlenecks for the drivers.\n"
