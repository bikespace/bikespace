        "comment": "Bike lanes in municipalities bring so many benefits. The decision to remove them feels like an emotional decision, not one based on cities' research (i.e., bike ridership has increased 600% since some of these lanes have been constructed). Giving so many Torontonians the opportunity to cycle safely has reduced congestion in the city, taking more cars off the road for commuting. The local BIAs love it too as bikers stop and shop more.\nRemoving bike lanes that have already been installed would be a waste of taxpayer's money. Time and resources have already been dedicated to installing these bike lanes, why would we waste that investment on removing them?\nThis provincial government needs to stay out of municipalities'\n"

        "comment": "I dissent to this bill for the following reason:\n1. There is no reasoning given for removing the aforementioned bike lanes but requires municipalities to submit reasoning for adding/justifying existing bike lanes? This is a double standard, as there is verifiable dataset confirming that emergency response time and bike userbase has increase 10x in the same timeframe that these bike lanes have been around but no data to suggest that this will reduce congestion? Adding another lane theoretically adds 50% capacity but in actuality adding more lanes has been shown time and time again to not reduce traffic. See UC Davis Research on this: \"a 10% increase in volume on the highway will, in the long run, lead to a 10% increase in the volume of driving\"\n2. Secondly this bill is being passed as a measure to reduce red tape to build highway infrastructure, which is again a double standard as we are adding more red tape for municipalities to reduce congestion in their neighborhood when requesting a bike lane? How much are we really achieving this objective?\n3. This provincial government and their leader were elected after promising voters that \"Even one bike related death in the city is one too many\". So why is the city and the government exerting their political will to remove key north/south bike lanes that happened to coincide with the location of their workplace? Circling back to the elected promise of protecting bikers, how does removal of protected bike lanes help protect cyclists as Doug Ford had promised. Protected bike lanes reduce bike-related intersection injuries by about 75 percent compared to comparable crossings without infrastructure\n4. None of the proposed \"Reducing Gridlock\" seeks to address the concerns of most of the constituents around reducing gridlock on arguably the most congested highway in this continent: the 401? How exactly are the bike lanes affecting the largest source of gridlock?\nAs a car user myself: Cars are not stuck in traffic, cars are traffic ...\n"

        "comment": "I am a 4th year Planning student at the University of Waterloo with academic and professional training in transportation planning. I am concerned about this act's intention to remove cycling lanes. My main concerns are summarized below:\n- Bike lanes are not causing congestion--cars are. Gridlock can be solved by improving alternative modes of transportation that take up less space, like bike lanes and transit. Removing cycling facilities and replacing them with travel lanes will cause latent demand from vehicles and will only worsen congestion.\n- Bike lanes save lives. Keeping transportation modes separate improves safety for all road users.\n- Ontarians should be moving away from car dependency. For reducing emissions, improving public health outcomes, and supporting local businesses, we need to keep active transportation facilities.\n- Removing existing cycling lanes, or delaying projects that have already been approved by municipal councils, will cost Ontarians millions of dollars.\nI am excited about how complete some of the cycling networks in our province have become. Removing bike lanes on streets like University and Bloor in Toronto and O'Connor in Ottawa will\nRather than spending millions of taxpayer dollars on removing infrastructure we've just paid for, I would like to see the province investing in making it easier for people to use this infrastructure year-round. Especially in Toronto, where it seems this act is focused, we need to come to terms with the fact that there simply is not enough space to move millions of private automobiles through the downtown core. Freeing up one lane will not solve this, and will force everyone who had switched to cycling back into their cars. Consider how removing key active transportation arteries will induce demand and worsen the gridlock problem.\nI also think it's inappropriate for the province to interfere with municipal issues. Many Ontario municipalities are building cycling facilities outlined in their Transportation Master Plans, which undergo rigorous public consultation processes and are approved by Council. Municipal governments know their cities best and have already developed evidence-based tools, which are supported by the public, to improve their transportation networks.\nFinally, I am concerned that the Minister's office will be in charge of approving requests from municipalities. This stipulation shows how this act is not evidence-based and is purely political. These requests should be sent to Ontario bureaucrats with expertise in transportation planning and engineering.\nI urge the province to reconsider this act and develop evidence-based policies. Ontarians don't want this.\n"

        "comment": "If enacted, the removal of bike lanes will impact my ability to use my bicycle to get to my destination in the vicinity of my residence. Currently, I'll bike anywhere up to 16 km away. I have seriously traumatic experiences  from riding in the center of the road (death threats, violence, near- and actual collisions). Removing bike lanes means I will no longer be using my bicycle because I value my safety. I will not use a car, because it is obscene to pollute out of laziness. I might walk, (up to about 8km), but more likely I will simply stay home. This will  be misinterpreted as meaning that bike lanes are not needed as much, because bike traffic will decreae. The opposite is true. I'm simply not willing to risk my life. If bike lanes were safer & wider I'd use them more. I'd be a healthier, happier Torontonian if we expanded and improved transportation options for cyclists.\n"

I wholeheartedly stand against removing safe cycling infrastructure from our roads in Ontario in favour of vehicle lanes. Not only will removing bike lanes make the shared roads dangerous and deadly for people on bikes, but it will continue to create communities that are car-dependant, and anti-public transit. I want an Ontario that prioritizes transportation by bike, bus, walking, carpooling and other sustainable methods. Not more drivers on wider roads that endanger people and the environment. The truth is, single occupancy vehicles are what create gridlock, traffic and waste our time, not cyclists, public transit and pedestrians on foot. Please do not pass this bill!!\n"

        "comment": "This is a horrible idea. Non motorized vehicle (walking, pedestrian, etc) traffic has been shown over and over again to reduce the traffic on small roads. By getting rid of bike lanes you are putting cyclists who will be forced to ride in the road at risk and you will increase congestion. Adding additional lanes has never, I repeat NEVER, in any scientific literature been shown to improve traffic flow. This bill makes no sense, and is illogical. Improving the safety of pedestrians and cyclists, who, by the way, take up far less room on the road than a car with only one person in it, or even a car with multiple people in it, should be your priority as repeatedly in the literature, in practice, and intuitively these are the road users that cause the fewest accidents, least pollution, are most sustainable, and improve traffic for those who need to take cars\n"

        "comment": "I am a Toronto resident and I am writing to express my concerns for Bill 212.\nThe solution to congestion in Ontario is not removing bike lanes in Toronto. Bike lanes in Toronto have nothing to do with provincial flow of traffic and in fact removing them will pose a risk to both drivers and bikers. The Bill also proposes the building of highway 413 through the Greenbelt to alleviate congestion, but the 407 is already an existing and underused highway that needs to be addressed first before spending billions to pave way for another highway that will likely be tolled with the proposal for broadband internet. We need another solution for density in our province.\nImpact of Bike Lanes\nThe province is overstepping its jurisdiction by proposing Bill 212 to remove and assess every bike lane in the city of Toronto. Bike lanes are a matter for municipalities, not provinces. The bike lane across the city, especially the ones on University, Bloor and Yonge are keeping both drivers and bikers safe. I am a driver in the city and wouldn't feel safe without dedicated and protected bike lanes to separate bikers from drivers. Our city also depends on delivery bikers to deliver our foods and goods. This demand for food delivery will not stop because there are no more bike lanes, in fact what is likely to happen is an increase in collisions and fatalities as all road users try to negotiate unclear roads. Removing bike lanes in the city will push our city back decades in creating infrastructure for all. Cities across North America like Montreal, Vancouver, Ottawa, Halifax, Saskatoon, New York, Washington, San Francisco, Chicago and many more have extensive bike networks that allow residents to unlock the full potential of their cities.\nImpact of Highway 413\nThe solution to congestion is not a new highway which extensive research by experts has shown will increase congestion even more. Research indicates that expanding road capacity often leads to induced demand,  where increased roadway space attracts more drivers, eventually resulting in congestion levels similar to those before expansion. Experts like Matthew Turner, a professor of economics at Brown University, emphasize that expanding road capacity without considering induced demand overlooks historical patterns of traffic behavior. Turner notes that building more highways has consistently failed to alleviate congestion in the long term. To effectively address traffic congestion, experts advocate for a multifaceted approach that includes investments in public transit like high speed trains, development of cycling infrastructure, and implementation of policies that encourage alternative modes of transportation.\nThere is already an existing and underused highway: the 407. Why is broadband internet needed for this proposed highway if it\u2019s not intended to be used for tolls? If the province is planning on tolling highway 413, it would likely be significantly underused just like the 407. The proposed bill also wants an exemption from the Environmental Assessment Act - why? These environmental acts exist  to assess the potential environmental effects before a project begins. Building a new highway through the Greenbelt will not alleviate congestion in Ontario and in fact could cause more congestion by incentivising people to use their cars more. . Great case studies are cities like\nWe need better infrastructure that can manage the density of our province for years to come, not short term solutions like highway 413 and removing bike lanes in Toronto.\n"

        "comment": "No red tap and bureaucracy\n   Bill 212 will just slow down local governments across all of Ontario providing essential and alternative modes of transportation. People should have the freedom to choose their preferred mode of transportation.\nEssential transportation infrastructure\n   If there was better cycling infrastructure many other people would be using it more, including myself. Unfortunately, in my area it is not currently safe enough to do so and very disconnected. This bill will make it more difficult to improve safety and effective bike infrastructure.\nBasic standard of safety\n   Bill 212 is a step back in safety for road users. By taking out bike lanes, cyclists and drivers will now be sharing the same lane. This increases the danger to road users/cyclists while not improving car traffic since cyclists would still need to use the lane. Also, by increasing the number of lanes, it will induce demand for more cars, which will increase the number of cars on the road, resulting in even more car traffic.\nMore simple for drivers\n   As a driver, it will be easier, less stressful, and safer if cyclists were in their own lane. Specifically with the removal of the Bloor St or Yonge St bike lanes, finding an alternative side street route for cyclists is not viable since the routes wound not be direct.\nBike lanes support transit\n   Better bike infrastructure solves the \"first mile, last mile\" issue, by making it easier to get to transit stations quicker and more efficiently. This bill will make commuting more difficult for people if there is a lack of connected infrastructure.\nCommon sense\n   A large amount of time and money has already been spent implementing these bike lanes. Planning, design, material acquisition, road closures, construction, etc. have all gone into implementing these bike lanes, and now we are going spend more time and money to do it again to go back to what is was, it is a devolving and wasteful plan. The demolition of bike lanes will also increase traffic due to road closures and increased construction workers in these areas. Instead of disconnecting infrastructure, we should be connecting and expanding it.\nPeople do not need to drive everywhere, if someplace is within a 15 minute bike ride, it makes more sense to bike instead of drive. 70% of people in Toronto already walk or bike for trips of this duration. For these short trips, it would just be adding to the existing car traffic. Having the choice in alternative modes of transportation gives people freedom of movement.\nBikes are smaller, more affordable, and better for everyone's health than cars. Getting more cars off the road should be the solution, it would make transportation better for everyone by improving traffic, health, and reducing overall harmful emissions. If all the current cyclists converted to driving cars, since bike lanes were removed or infrastructure was lacking, this would make car traffic even worse. Alternative modes of transportation is better for everyone. By making other modes of transportation worse, it forces people to choose the most funded/primary option, Bill 212 will make driving a car the primary option. Encouraging everyone to drive will increase gridlock.\nSchedule 3 - Highway 413 Act\n   Exemption from the Environmental Assessment Act is a side step to avoid environmental considerations and public opinion when developing a project of this magnitude. Especially when Highway 413 is planned to cut through the Greenbelt and three parcels of conservation land north of Toronto and prime farmland. This will endanger the natural wildlife and remove viable farmland for Ontarians. It is also a hypocritical portion of the bill, reducing the bureaucracy for building highways but increasing it for building bike lanes.\nSchedule 4 - Highway Traffic Act\n   This portion of the bill is very vague for municipalities to get approval from the Ministry for constructing bike lanes. It only states municipalities need to provide the Ministry with information but nothing else with no specifics on what is required for approval. The information could prove to be beneficial for their community but the Ministry could still deny the request. This bill just adds to the bureaucracy and will hinder the construction of all bike lanes.\n"

Until then biking in traffic and sharing the road along Bloor especially at Yonge was dangerous and not enjoyable. Most car traffic coming off the Bayview/Bloor exit dissipated by Bay Street  so there is no commuter traffic congestion west of Yonge on Bloor. Leave the bike lanes alone and finish the Finch and Eglinton rapid transit routes if you are truly serious about dealing with congestion in a city of over three million people.\n"

        "comment": "I have the following points to make around this proposed initiative:\n1. Traffic times with the installation of bike lanes have not increased significantly since their installation. So 'common sense' tells us their removal will not significantly reduce automobile travel times.\n2. Bike lanes do not have a negative effect on emergency vehicle response times. In fact, according to emergency response personnel, they may well improve response times.\n3. Ironically, given the point above, the removal of bike lanes will require increased need for emergency vehicles as auto/bike collisions (an outcome that never favours the cyclist) will without a doubt lead to more injuries and likely more cyclist deaths as well. As a cyclist in Toronto for almost 25 years, I can say this with the highest degree of confidence.\n4. The cost of removing lanes relative to the projected actual benefit (a negligible reduction in automobile travel times), does not make fiscal sense. In other words, the spend is not worth the actual benefit. Therefore, it appears it is the political benefit that is driving this proposal. And political benefits do not benefit people equally. Sometimes they don't benefit people at all.\n5. Claims that the construction of bike lanes have negatively altered the 'character' of Toronto's neighborhoods, are true. However, the change in character in some neighborhoods where bike lanes have been installed has been welcomed by businesses (who have seen business increase), and by residents, who have seen vehicular traffic speeds reduced, creating safer neighborhoods. Some neighborhoods do not share this view. Those would be neighborhoods that are served less efficiently by transit, and for whom, therefore, the car is viewed as the only viable means of transportation. One would expect that in these neighborhoods, bike lanes would introduce a change that is less welcome. Yet study after study have demonstrated that bike lanes have significant long-term social and economic  benefits. Those benefits may not, admittedly, be realized evenly and at the same pace in every location. But those benefits will be realized by all neighborhoods over time. Bike lanes, without a doubt, introduce a culture change and by all accounts a positive one, demonstrated by cities across Canada and across the globe. The failure is not in installing the bike lanes. The failure is in removing them at the first sign of friction. It takes time. But, as noted above, if the decision is being driven by political vs. social considerations, then it should surprise no one that the decision has been made at the first sign of resistance. That may prove to be successful politics, but it is not successful leadership  - socially or fiscally.\nThe following links support these points:\nhttps://www.cbc.ca/news/business/biking-lanes-business-health-1.5165954\nhttps://www.cbc.ca/news/science/bike-lanes-impacts-1.7358319\nhttps://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-gear/bikes-and-biking/bike-lanes-\u2026\nhttps://bicyclepotential.org/blog/the-benefits-and-importance-of-bike-l\u2026\nhttps://trec.pdx.edu/news/study-finds-bike-lanes-can-provide-positive-e\u2026\nhttps://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2024/10/3/do-bike-lanes-reduce-cong\u2026\n"

I understand that removing lanes will not eliminate cycling traffic, but will instead push this traffic into existing lanes, posing greater danger to motorists and cyclists alike. The reality that most other major cities have already acknowledged is that urban centres are hubs for mixed forms of transportation - they are not through-ways for temporary visitors, and it is the government\u2019s responsibility to look after citizen\u2019s bodily safety NOT some incremental increase in efficiency that comes at the cost of peoples\u2019 lives.

This comment will first cover the proposal details provided by the ERO and then the contents of the Bill itself.\nProposal Details - October 31 update\n\"...addendum to the framework that would require the province to remove sections of the Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue bike lanes in the City of Toronto and return them to a lane of traffic for motor vehicles\" - overstep of the province into municipal responsibilities and expertise. This language also wrongfully implies that motor vehicles should be the default mode of travel on roads.\n\"...provide the province with the authority to establish a review process on other existing bike lanes (where the removal of a lane of traffic took place)\" - again encroaching on municipal affairs, especially when lane installation already goes through review processes. The lane is still a lane of traffic.\n\"Approval will be based on a set of specified criteria, to be set out in guidance and/or regulation. The criterion for the assessment of existing bike lanes will consider environmental implications and be developed in consultation with targeted stakeholders including large municipalities.\" - Why are criteria not already established or examples provided? The environmental implications of bike lanes are obvious, in that they facilitate travel that does not produce GHG emissions or noise pollution.\nProposal Details - bullet points\n\"Recognizes the need to build priority highways faster as our province grows in order to get people and goods out of gridlock and save drivers and businesses time and money\" - with the current level of sprawl and congestion in the province, greater focus should be placed on enhancing alternative modes of travel. By shifting more drivers to other modes, they may be able to save even more money by not having to have a motor vehicle. The drivers that remain will consequently see lower congestion due to fewer vehicles on the road in general.\n\"Recognizes that accidents and lane closures can worsen traffic congestion and impact the quality of life of Ontarians\" - another approach would be to reduce the number of cars on the road, thereby reducing chances of accidents. Quality of life is also impacted literally when people are killed in accidents.\n\"Is building Highway 413, recognizing the importance of this highway to millions of drivers from across Ontario\" - this project has already been demonstrated by transportation analyses and models to save minimal time for a small portion of people at the cost of vital ecological and agricultural land\nProposal\n\"...Ontario is looking to fight gridlock and get drivers where they need to go faster.\" - the Province should focus on projects that benefit people who use all different travel modes.\n\"Prescribed municipalities would be required to seek provincial approval to allow for the implementation of new bicycle lanes...that require the removal of an existing lane of traffic.\" - this proposal also assumes that bike lanes increase congestion when the opposite has clearly been demonstrated worldwide.\n\"Additional authorities to facilitate the removal of these lanes would also be included in the legislation including an exemption from the Environmental Assessment Act\" - this is a completely different subject than reviews of bike lanes, and should not be included in the same Bill.. The EAA is necessary to ensure the safety of our province's vital ecological and agricultural lands, the removal of which directly harms the lives of the plants and animals living there as well as Ontario citizens.\n\"...and the requirement for the City of Toronto to provide support to facilitate the removal of the bike lanes.\" - as this is a Provincial proposal to directly manage municipal affairs, the City should bear no responsibility.\nOther parts of the Bill\nSchedule 2\n\"Delivery of goods and services to facilitate 24 hour construction\" - likely to cause further noise pollution issues with people and animals\nSchedule 3\n\"Activities before process completed\" - the activities listed in this section seek to circumvent the EAA by making progress before specific assessment steps are fulfilled properly\nSchedule 4\n\"Ministry approval for bicycle lanes required\" - the time and money spent on this endeavor does not seem to be the best approach. It suggests a lack of trust in municipalities and a desire for increased Ministerial oversight.\n\"Consideration of traffic flow\n(4)  When considering whether to approve the design for the construction of a bicycle lane, the Ministry may consider whether it would unduly diminish the orderly movement of motor vehicle traffic.\" - there is no objective measure to what is considered \"unduly diminish\". This also once again sends a clear message that motor vehicles are more important than the people in them and the people who do not drive.\nUltimately this Bill is very flawed. There are five main schedules proposed that cover a wide range of subjects and should not be combined into one Bill. There is no mention of a plan to replace or install safer cycling infrastructure if lanes are removed. The Bill is written under a false assumption that increased lanes reduce congestion when the opposite has consistently been demonstrated. The environmental impacts of increased driving are not considered and promoting increased driving is counterproductive to current climate action and goals. The cost of removing the bike lanes could be spent on other initiatives such as transit projects or in other sectors.\nFor municipalities with very little of non-existent cycling infrastructure, those sections have almost no impact and may in fact make it more difficult in the future should the demand arise. For the City of Toronto specifically, the Province is directly targeting specific installations that citizens rely on for safe and convenient travel. Street parking also removes lanes of traffic and are inconvenient because cars take up more space than bikes and make it more difficult for all travelers to navigate streets. Businesses will also be affected as the reduction in bike lanes make it more unsafe and difficult to stop and go into a business while driving along with many other cars.\n"
