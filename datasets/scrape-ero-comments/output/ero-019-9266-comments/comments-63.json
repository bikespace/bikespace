Aggressive driving is a common challenge on Toronto\u2019s streets, and dedicated bike lanes are crucial for the safety of cyclists. Cutting these lanes puts lives at risk and discourages sustainable, active transportation. Please maintain and evolve this essential infrastructure to ensure a safer, more accessible city for all.\n"

        "comment": "This is a truly awful bill. It does absolutely nothing to reduce traffic or gridlock and the premier, his ministers and the rest of the government knows this. They are lying through their teeth to sell out this province.  Bake lines are important tools to protect cyclist, pedestrians, and even drivers. Without bike lines, cyclists will be forced to either cycle on the road, which will be unsafe and create more traffic, or cycle on the sidewalk, putting pedestrians at risk. This is dangerous and will result in injuries and death \u2014 injuries and death that could have been prevented without the premier\u2019s involvement with municipal politics.\nIt also seems that, at least partly, the bicycle infrastructure issue is being brought up as a smokescreen, to distract the electorate from the premier\u2019s other terrible decisions (and potential crimes, pending an RCMP investigation). Quite frankly, this is unacceptable and the premier should feel utterly ashamed at just how poorly he has managed the province of Ontario during his mandates. Shame on you, Doug Ford.\n"

        "comment": "This is not going to reduce travel times for commuters numerous studies have found that the way that you reduce travel times is through providing others with different types of travel other than cars. This is a waste of taxpayer money as the bike lanes are crucial infrastructure to Toronto and removing them will only push cyclists onto the road slowing down traffic even more. Not only will you have more traffic but also more deaths as well. The blood is in the hands of the provincial government if they remove bike lanes. The number of deaths due to drivers is constantly increasing as more and more cars are on the road.\nThis government is not conservative if they were they would leave the bike lanes alone as it's about saving costs not increasing them for the taxpayer.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose the framework for bike lanes proposed in Bill 212. Prioritizing cycling infrastructure is a critical step toward reducing gridlock and improving urban mobility. While cars are often seen as essential, they dominate public space, leading to congestion and pollution. By investing in bike lanes, we can shift more people toward efficient, eco-friendly transit modes, easing road traffic for all.\nBike lanes are not only beneficial for reducing gridlock but also promote healthier, active lifestyles. They make commuting safer and more accessible for cyclists, encouraging more people to consider cycling as a viable alternative to driving. Studies from cities with robust cycling infrastructure, such as Copenhagen and Amsterdam, show that bike lanes improve traffic flow for both cyclists and drivers, reduce carbon emissions, and enhance quality of life.\nAdding another lane, building another highway, and creating more car-dependent infrastructure has never been the solution to gridlock. It\u2019s a temporary fix that only encourages more driving and further strains our transportation systems. We can\u2019t put all our eggs in one basket. Instead, we need to embrace a more diverse, multimodal approach to transit.\nInvesting in alternative transit options, like bike lanes, benefits everyone\u2014not just cyclists. It reduces congestion for drivers by taking cars off the road, lowers pollution for all residents, and promotes healthier communities. Moreover, it provides equitable transportation options for people who cannot afford or choose not to drive, helping to connect them to jobs, education, and services.\nBy supporting this framework, we aren\u2019t just investing in bikes; we\u2019re investing in cleaner air, less traffic, safer streets, and a more resilient transportation network for all. A future that prioritizes multiple transit modes is a future where our cities are more livable, efficient, and sustainable.\n"

I don\u2019t see how bike lanes in Toronto, Kenora, Sudbury, Windsor, or Cornwall should be at all an issue for the province.\nTo me this feels like there are bike lanes that the Premier doesn\u2019t like. And he is once again playing Mayor of Toronto instead of Premier of Ontario. There was a story in the Globe today that suggests he is already planning to \u201cget rid of them\u201d. This flies in the face of the language of the bill.\nThis blatant disregard for cycling as a valid mode of transport in Toronto WILL increase death and injury on our streets. It WILL NOT reduce traffic or congestion. People on bikes WILL.\nThank you for your time.\n"

Removing cycling infrastructure and adding more lanes is contrary to the world we want to live in.\nFurther, it should not be the province's role to dictate how Toronto manages its streets.\nSee supporting documents for evidence of how bike lanes reduce congestion, bike lanes have a positive economic impact on adjacent businesses, and other related evidence that debunks conceptions which are driving this proposal.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal will do absolutely nothing to advance the \"objectives\". Bike lanes take bicyclists out of traffic, which makes traffic move more efficiently. Bike lanes make the roads safer for both the bicyclists and the motorist. As a driver, I want the bicyclist to be in their own lane, even if it means less traffic lanes.\nThe decision to remove a lane of traffic to put in bike lanes should rest with the municipality, as the local government understands the needs of their local roads. It's completely nonsensical, to have a government bureaucrat in Toronto determining if Thunder Bay should have a bike lane. Decisions that will effect the municipality should be brought to council meetings, where the local citizens can determine if those choices best optimize their own roads.\nThis proposal is based off of Toronto traffic and shouldn't apply to the rest of the Province. The province has more important things to worry about than municipal bike lanes.\n"

I just can't believe this provincial government is making decisions based on 'feelings' and 'popularity' of ideas, rather that fact-based data driven decisions.\nCycling lanes improved the streetscape Bloor West, the entire area is more safe and pleasant for pedestrians and cyclists and even drivers, it's bringing more people to my business to spend money. I do not want a 4 lane highway full of commuters ripping past my store and through the neighborhood.\nRemoving bike lanes will do absolutely nothing to improve traffic. The traffic was bad before the lanes and the traffic is bad with the lanes and if this moves forward, the traffic will still be bad once the bike lanes are removed. The only difference is that my business will suffer, the nieghbhourhood and streetscape will suffer, cyclists and pedestrians will suffer, tourists will suffer.\nSpending even 5minutes listening to actual traffic experts will tell you that same conclusion, but obviously this government under Doug Ford has stopped listening to subject matter experts and is now basing policy on whatever Doug Ford feels like.\n"

A bike lane will reduce the amount of cars on a street, making it safer for pedestrians, allow for more accessible options of transportation, and reduce combustion of car engine fuels in general. If there\u2019s more transportation options, we have the option to choose which transportation mode works for us, cars will not be the future if we are committing to our climate targets. This is an uneducated attempt at alleviating traffic, and could very well make traffic worse by encouraging more drivers to use roads that were previously going to be made into mixed use transit. If Canada cares about meeting its goals, this bill should not go through.\n"
