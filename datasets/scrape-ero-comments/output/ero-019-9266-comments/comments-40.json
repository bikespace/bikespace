        "comment": "I bike to work every day, from mid-town to Toronto to downtown, via the Yonge, Bloor and University bike lanes. Riding home in rush hour, there is consistently an equal number of bikes as cars stopped at University northbound at College Street: the bike lanes are well-used, and their success encourages more people to take up bike commuting.\nThere is no evidence to suggest that bike lanes increase congestion, and there is plenty of evidence to support that increased access to cycling is beneficial to local businesses. Cyclists cause less damage to roads, don't pollute, and improve the health of citizens, all of which are a net benefit to the economy.\nThis bill is not based on fact: it is the product of one person's imagination and moronic gut feeling.\n"

        "comment": "Currently the only way for me to get to work across the city (GTA) my bike is to use the bike lane on Bloor. If the bike lane is removed I will be cycling / merging onto the street itself, slowing down car traffic to my speed, as there are no reasonable alternatives to travel across town without a huge detour. Furthermore, there is currently a whole lane dedicated to parking on major streets like college and bloor, so why don\u2019t we remove those and have people park on side streets or public garages\u2026\nWe need bike lanes to reduce auto traffic and congestion. However, what we need more is a network of bike lanes that makes sense. Currently the lanes do not connect well, or randomly end thus forcing cyclists onto the road, which leads to slow traffic. If we had a few sensible east-west and north-south lanes it would allow people to actually commute by bike rather than being forced onto the road or random side streets.\n"

        "comment": "I am a local utility and commuter cyclist (vulnerable road user), using my bike to get to/from work and for travel, besides far more tasks unrelated to work, bringing cargo on a trailer from a store to my home.\nI utilise bike infrastructure (bike lanes) where it is available for a far safer and more comfortable commute, including if bringing fragile items home (or donating large items to places which accept them). This also allows bringing my cats to the veterinarian for a check-up on occasion.\nWithout safer streets (bike infrastructure included), road violence becomes a far bigger problem for everybody not driving, resulting in motorists being impatient about getting \"slowed down\" when we are rightfully taking the lane (HTA 147) to be as visible as possible and doing a DANGEROUS CLOSE PASS (HTA 148, 6.1) in retaliation, throwing things at us, threatening violence or death, or hitting us with their vehicle, because we are rightfully using the road to commute or to do our jobs.\nThis is unacceptable behaviour and removing bike infrastructure will only put everyone who doesn't drive, in danger. It is very much seen as regressive, rather than progressive, especially if it interferes with municipalities rights to progress and make all roads safer for everybody who walks, bikes, wheels, rolls (which is a charter protected right), uses public transit or drives.\nEach vehicle (on average) takes up the space of six to nine bicycles in motion, or 10-20 if parked, regardless what type of bike it is. This is a known proven fact. Anyone can do this measurement and demonstrate it by doing a group ride with appropriate spacing.\n"

As for automobile congestion, more people cycling, less automobiles on the road, and more public transit enabling travel within and throughout the GTA will all move the needle more than removing bike lanes and getting more automobiles back on the road. Please keep the province out of municipal business and allow cities to manage their own cycling infrastructure, we need you to focus on getting transit connectivity up and running please.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is ridiculously misguided, to the point that it must be considered a politically driven vote grab.\nIt is retrogressive. Our cities don\u2019t have room for more cars. We need other space-sharing alternatives. Bike lanes are a proven solution world wide.\nIt victimizes one constituency, relegating bike commuters (who are in fact members of many other constituencies) to less safe and/or drastically less convenient roadways, in favour of an old fashioned & unsustainable world view that the suburban driver constituency favours. We can\u2019t move forward if we move backwards.\nIt will either put more drivers on the roads or cause delays and frustration by putting bikes back on the roadways, or both. Road-user frustration will lead to dangerous behaviour.\nMore helpful would be prevention of traffic lane removal for construction on adjacent properties (condos, etc) and eliminating curb side parking on thoroughfares.\n"

        "comment": "This legislation is absurd. It won't even achieve its stated goals of reducing commute times and improving traffic. Induced demand says that more people will switch from alternate modes of transport to driving their own cars, which will dramatically increase the noise, air, and ground pollution, and make streets significantly more dangerous for everyone outside of cars.\nAll evidence currently points to getting people out of cars and into other modes of transport, as the only viable way of reducing traffic, yet this legislation proposes the opposite is going to happen... some how. Instead we will see car volumes increase, and traffic get even worse as we try to cram more vehicles into downtowns that were not meant to accommodate so many vehicles.\nEven IF this legislation achieves its goals of reducing the amount of time it takes to drive a car from point A to point B (which it won't), where do all these cars park? We need to bulldoze many many more acres of land, be it existing buildings, or parks/nature, to build all the parking required to store all these vehicles. This in turn will make issues like flooding due to impermeable ground cover, pollution due to spills, exhaust, and worn tires, and noise due to engines and quickly moving vehicles, much much worse.\nThis legislation is the exact opposite direction that we should be going with this province.\n"

        "comment": "The City of Ottawa does a lot of great things however the way we plan cycling lanes completely ignores facts and data. Cycling represents an insignificant portion of commuting per census data. We have reduced vehicle lanes on many major arterial roads in the core such as Laurier, O'Connor, Scott, Albert, Slater, and McArthur and installed poorly used cycling lanes that result in increased traffic congestion. Further, many of the new \"protected intersections\" are confusing for drivers and obviously very difficult for larger vehicles like delivery trucks and public transport to navigate.\nI am not opposed to cycling lanes but they need to be installed where they do not impact major commuter routes. The installation of cycling lanes on major arterials is quite frankly more of an anti-car measure rather than pro-cyclist. The vast majority of Ottawans move around in personal vehicles and our transportation planning practices should reflect this. It is purely wishful thinking to believe that choking vehicle traffic  will result in anything more than driver frustration. People aren't getting rid of their cars.\n"

        "comment": "This Bill seems to not take into account the millions of Ontarians that currently cycle or would cycle more often if there were increased protected bike lanes. These would also help drivers get to their destination faster by removing additional cars from the roads.\nThe provincial government already has a number of transportation projects in large municipalities that are well behind schedule and whose construction is backing up traffic and adding to the current congestion. Humbly suggest the provincial government spends its time completing and expediting those much needed projects rather than wasting resources on bills like this one. They can\u2019t even complete these urgent projects on budget or on time in municipalities, why should they be given more work to do when the projects that will make the most difference still need attention.\n"

        "comment": "Limiting the construction of new bike lanes is not good planning. The province should not be regulating where bike lanes can be constructed in a city the size of Toronto.\nIn previous decades, Toronto used to be a city in which you could drive anywhere easily. The city is home to much much more people and jobs now. We cannot expect driving to be the main method of transportation anywhere in the city of Toronto. It has resulted in traffic gridlock that is bad for everyone. We can\u2019t go back to the good old days of everyone driving everywhere. Traffic will not get better in the city with any approach that puts cars first. What will help fix our traffic problem is getting people into other, much more efficient modes of transport. If it is easier, quicker and safer to use transit, walk or cycle then people will do that and leave the roads free for people that actually need to be in a car. We need to prioritize bike lanes and transit to make this happen. People and cars will flow through the city more smoothly if more people are on transit or on bikes. It\u2019s that simple. If you follow the data this is the only conclusion you would come to.\nWe need better transit, better cycling infrastructure and more people living in high density, mixed use and transit accessible communities. Please prioritize that. For everyone\u2019s sanity.\nI don\u2019t own a car and get around by myself and with my 1 year old son by walking, catching transit and cycling. Every now and then I need to make a journey by car and I use Uber or a car share service. If everyone could use this model then there would be much less cars on the road and when people need to make a journey by car it isn\u2019t an absolutely horrible experience. Make cycling or taking transit the better option. It\u2019s the only way to fix traffic in Toronto. Don\u2019t restrict new bike lanes. We need much more of them to make cycling (the far more efficient mode of transit) safer and more attractive.\n"

More and more neighbours are using them.  Let's trust our local urban planners to do what's most helpful for this of us who live here.  Bicycles are the most efficient way to get around in most cases.  Cleaner air and greenhouse emissions can easily be reduced if we keep growing our network of bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes can significantly decrease traffic congestion. By providing a dedicated route for cyclists, we reduce the number of cars on the road, easing congestion and improving traffic flow. Research conducted by Carnegie Mellon University found that even a small shift of 10% of short car trips to micromobility (like bikes or scooters) could lead to a substantial reduction in traffic congestion and vehicle miles traveled (Government Technology, 2023). Additionally, a study from the University of California, Los Angeles, demonstrated that bike lanes can increase the speed of traffic for cars by reducing the number of lane changes and merging maneuvers (UCLA Institute of Transportation Studies, 2021).\nBeyond reducing traffic congestion, bike lanes play a vital role in enhancing cyclist safety. By providing a segregated path, bike lanes minimize the risk of accidents with cars. Studies have consistently shown that the presence of bike lanes significantly reduces the likelihood of cyclist fatalities and injuries.\nA study conducted by the Danish Road Institute found that the risk of cyclist fatalities and serious injuries was reduced by 44% on roads with protected bike lanes compared to roads without them (Danish Road Institute, 2019). Similarly, research from the University of California, Berkeley, revealed that protected bike lanes can reduce cyclist fatalities by up to 80% (Berkeley Transportation Center, 2021).\n"

Get people out if cars into transit and  cycling. That's common sense.\n"
