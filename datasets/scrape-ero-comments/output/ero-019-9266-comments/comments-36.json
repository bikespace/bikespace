As a cyclist I like them because my children and I are\nsafer (and we are one less car on the road!). Please reconsider this plan, there are no studies on this earth that find cars are impeded by bike lanes, it doesn't even make sense, it's just at the side of the road. This feels like a bizarre move for the province. we should be encouraging people not to drive in order to decrease traffic, not to encourage more driving.\n"

        "comment": "It is almost impossible to capture all the issues with removing bike lanes or preventing municipalities from making their own decisions about city planning in this comment.  But I will outline some of the more obvious concerns below.\nHow exactly is this legislation supposed to increase traffic flow?  Are bikes going to disappear and no longer be used as transportation?  People will continue to use bikes to get around, only now cyclists will be in a lane of live traffic, slowing cars down, creating choke points and getting riders killed.  Congestion is not being dealt with, only risk to cyclists is being increased.  There are several roads without bike lanes that have heavy traffic, what does this legislation do to relieve that congestion?  In fact the QEW/Gardiner, 403 and 401 don't have bike lanes and all these roads are parking lots for large portions of the day.  Removing bike lanes to help traffic reach these highways doesn't seem to work towards reducing gridlock faced by most drivers.\nThere is often a lane of traffic occupied by cars that are parked, how are non-moving vehicles blocking a lane of traffic not the largest problem for lane availability and congestion?  Bike lanes move people and reduce congestion, parked cars do neither.\nWhat are the climate implications of this legislation?  If it successfully eliminates cyclists who now have to drive, there  will be increased congestion (no matter how many lanes are available) as well as increases to carbon dioxide emissions.  Is this viewed as a positive by this government?  If not, what steps are being taken to mitigate the increases to pollution?\nWhat are the impacts to small businesses?  Bike shops are found all over the province, often independently owned by small business people.  Decreased demand of bikes will follow the removal of safe cycling infrastructure.  Coffee shops, restaurants and other shops will also feel the pinch when ability to travel from neighbourhood to neighbourhood is reduced for those who don't have access to cars or don't want to sit in traffic and have to search for parking spots upon arrival.\nWith a ministry of Red Tape Reduction I am sure you are aware the costs (opportunity as well financial) of adding layers of approvals to municipalities trying to deal with their unique situations and desires.\nThis legislation seems punitive to a specific group and does nothing to solve any problems.  Please let us join the modern world that is no longer 100% car dependent.\n"

Prabmeet Sarkaria is just such a person demonstrating his incompetence by publicly promoting precisely this belief.\nIf Sarkaria believes in data-driven policy (which he should), he should read the data on the concept of induced demand, which is frankly something any transit minister should already be well aware of this many months on the job, appointee or not.\nThe provincial government should not be overreaching and meddling in metropolitan affairs like this, it\u2019s unbecoming, counterproductive and wasteful of public resources.\n"

Please consider that this puts the lives of cyclists (many of whom are young children or families riding together) at risk.\nIt doesn't even solve congestion because the bikers just have to take up lanes of traffic or would have to abandon their bikes and get in cars which adds more traffic either way.

Removing these bike lanes on University Ave, Bloor St, Yonge St, and Eglington Ave will only make car traffic worse while killing lives, flooding the ERs. I trust the Ontario government to rethink the decision and come to their senses to protect lives and not spend money on making car traffic even worse by removing bike lanes.\n"

These are municipal decisions legitimately approved by Toronto City Council with overwhelming majorities, including the local councillors in the cases of high-profile lanes on Bloor, Yonge and University. This is appalling overreach by a provincial government, only seeming less so because this Premier has a pattern of such overreach into debates he lost a decade ago while in municipal politics.\nThe only way to reduce vehicle traffic is to provide viable alternatives to driving, such as safe cycling. Road safety also matters, and calmer, safer streets benefit everyone, whether in a vehicle or not.\n"

Traffic experts have been demonstrating that induced demand is the real issue, combined with systematic delays and underfunding of public transit systems.\nThis Act is designed to appeal to a base of Conservative Party voters who do not see the public benefit of cycling as a form of transportation and as a result will respond positively  during the next election to the PC party of Ontario.\nThis Act ignores the benefits that cycling brings to urban residents through better health, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, lowered noise levels, and better mental health.\n"

        "comment": "As a young professional living in Mississauga and working in Toronto. I think this proposal is extremely regressive and harmful to the future of the province. I\u2019ve visited many countries and cities that have incredible transit and bike infrastructure that makes these places more vibrant and attractive for people to call home and raise their families. Neither me nor my friends plan to own cars because they are expensive and bad for our environment. This proposal will only remove the most affordable and sustainable transportation options that we have. And this will make our congestion crisis WORSE. Research shows that adding more lanes to a road/hwy does not make traffic better. If all the people who bike today started driving cars with single occupants, our roads will be way more congested.\nAs a taxpayer and resident of Ontario, I would like to see more transit and bike infrastructure. We want safer, affordable, and sustainable travel options. I hope that the province and MTO reconsiders this terrible proposal and instead focuses their time, energy and money on policy issues that will help the citizens of Ontario.\nIf this proposal goes forward, young professionals will leave Ontario and find a home in a province that understands the needs of their residents and the climate crisis.\n"

        "comment": "I contribute to traffic congestion as a motor vehicle operator when the only option for me to get to work, school or home is by motor vehicle. Bicycle infrastructure including bicycle lanes on roadways make it safer and practical to use an alternative form of transportation for me and my family. They provide numerous opportunities for me to leave my vehicle at home and use a bicycle.\nBicycle infrastructure recently installed on Aquitaine Ave in Mississauga provide a safe bicycle route for me to use to get to work instead of driving. I now choose to bicycle to work and leave my vehicle at home, mitigating my contribution to motor vehicle congestion.\nThe proposal also is myopicly focused on motor vehicle congestion as the single important metric for successful road use. The proposal should also consider other Road use metrics like pedestrian safety, inclusion of non motor vehicle use (pedestrians, bicycles, public transit), environmental emissions. By focusing only on motor vehicle congestion we run the very real risk of designing roadways that are effectively only for motor vehicles, increasing dependence on motor vehicles.\n"

        "comment": "Please listen to a non-Liberal\u2019s informed understanding about a \u2018Cars-first\u2019 vs \u2018Mixed-transport\u2019 transportation system. It is 7 very short points, and will take no time to read.\nMy goal is to advocate for efficiency and economic benefit. I am not an anti-car radical.\nThere is no such thing as a \u201cwar-on-cars\u201d. Traffic engineering is not a \u201cculture war\u201d. This is about efficient transportation and the benefits of a mixed-transport system, including economic and health.\nThe following applies primarily to urban & suburban environments, as opposed to heavily rural areas, who have different needs.\nThis is a brief run-down of an informed understanding of how a cars-first commuting system affects traffic, as well as health and economic outcomes.\n1A) Traffic is caused by cars on the road.\n1B) The majority of car trips are one-driver, zero-passenger, zero-cargo. These trips could be done more efficiently with mixed-transport, from cycling to public transport and more.\n1C) Trips transporting multiple passengers, cargo including materials and equipment, utility vehicles, emergency vehicles and freight, etc. do not contribute to traffic significantly. Leisure driving also does not contribute significantly to traffic.\n2) More car lanes DO NOT decrease traffic. Additional lanes fill with cars resulting in the same volume of traffic but with more cars on the road. This does not decrease traffic on the roadway and increases congestion everywhere else on the road network.\n3) Cycling REDUCES cars on the road.\n4) People need SAFE & COMPLETE cycling routes. Without this, they will not feel safe and will not cycle. A significant number of trips taken by car every day could easily be taken by cycle, but cannot accomplish this with an incomplete cycling network.\n5) Local economies LOOSE MONEY when there is only car infrastructure. Local economies GAIN MONEY when they reduce car-first infrastructure in favour of MIXED-TRANSPORT infrastructure.\n6) Travel is ground to a halt and at the same time, a chaotic, stressful, dangerous mess when it is built for cars first.\n7A) EVERY person, driver, cyclist, pedestrian, experiences massive of stress navigating the cars-first transportation system. This stress represents a significant, meaningful and immediate public health concern that could easily be mitigated by mixed-transport infrastructure.\n7B) Mixed-transport results in positive health outcomes not limited to the benefits of walking and cycling. Reduced stress, reduced emissions and particulate matter and reduced noise pollution are just a few.\n7C) Increased positive health outcomes directly result in reduced healthcare costs and increased economic productivity.\nCONCLUSION:\nCars-first is inefficient. Cars-first is expensive to the individual and to the economy. Cars-first is dangerous and bad for public health.\nMixed-transport is efficient. Mixed-transport makes money. Mixed-transport increases health, saving even more money.\nMixed-transport is just good engineering.\nMixed-transport SAVES MONEY and MAKES THINFS FASTER.\nMixed-transport is CONSERVATIVE.\nMixed-transport is conservative.\nThank you for your time.\n"

        "comment": "I am a conversative supporter however this is too far and would be an enormous mistake. The recent Ontario legislation proposing to bar new bike lanes and revisit existing ones in favor of expanding car lanes raises significant concerns regarding urban planning, environmental sustainability, and public health.\nFirstly, this legislation appears to prioritize automobile traffic over sustainable transportation options, contradicting global trends that emphasize the need for cities to adapt to climate change. Expanding car lanes not only encourages more vehicle use but also perpetuates traffic congestion and air pollution, contributing to the deterioration of urban air quality and public health issues.\nMoreover, the emphasis on cars over bikes ignores the growing body of research demonstrating the benefits of cycling infrastructure. Bike lanes promote active transportation, reducing reliance on cars and encouraging a healthier lifestyle. They can lead to decreased traffic accidents and improve overall safety for all road users, including pedestrians.\nAdditionally, this approach undermines the principles of smart urban design. Cities that prioritize cycling and public transit over cars tend to foster more vibrant communities with better accessibility and reduced traffic congestion. By revisiting existing bike lanes, the legislation risks eroding the progress made in creating more pedestrian-friendly environments, ultimately diminishing the quality of life for residents.\nIn light of the pressing challenges posed by climate change, public health crises, and urban sprawl, this legislation appears short-sighted. It prioritizes short-term car-centric solutions over long-term sustainable strategies that promote healthier, more livable communities. Rather than revisiting bike lanes, Ontario should be investing in expanding and enhancing cycling infrastructure, fostering a more balanced and sustainable transportation system.\nI will not be supporting the Conservative party in any upcoming election with this legislation on the table. I would move out of Ontario if this legislation were to pass.\n"

We\u2019ve both cycled for over 20 years in all seasons in the city and we\u2019ve had less dangerous incidents with cars or streetcar tracks as more and more bike lanes have been installed. Please don\u2019t remove them.\n15 years ago, my husband was hit by a car near university avenue and was hospitalized with injuries. The driver was found at fault and fortunately my husband recovered after surgery and rehabilitation.\nWe are responsible and courteous cyclists who also enjoy driving our car around the city. We are sympathetic to drivers angry with traffic, but understand that reducing and removing bike lanes are not the solution.\nWe recently had a baby and are terrified that the government is planning to make the streets less safe for my family.

        "comment": "This seems like a policy that is much more about politicking than actually improving congestion. Induced demand (and concrete studies from many major cities) show that adding more vehicle lanes and/or more highways does nothing to improve congestion in the long-term. What does help is getting people out of vehicles by providing frequent and reliable transit options as well as safe ways to travel by bicycle or walking. Your plan is the exact opposite of that. You have provided no evidence to support your plan and instead rely on a few anecdotes. In addition to not improving congestion, this plan increases the risks for those travelling outside of a vehicle. This is misguided, poor policy in an attempt to garner a few votes in suburban ridings.\n"
