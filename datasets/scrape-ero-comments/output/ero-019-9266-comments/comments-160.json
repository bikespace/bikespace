The growth of Toronto's bike network over the last few years has made it a feasible option for my commute, and it's really opened up more of the city to me. So many roads though are still extremely dangerous for walking and biking, and this law threatens to keep them that way. Forcing everyone to drive is no way to ease congestion, it just makes travel within our city deadlier and more expensive.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal, if enacted, would be a step backward in Ontario\u2019s efforts to build a sustainable, safe, and accessible transportation system for all.\nCycling infrastructure is not only an essential tool in combating the climate crisis but is also a vital component in creating equitable, healthy, and livable cities. As organizations deeply committed to the wellbeing of our communities and our environment, we find the notion of halting or limiting the development of bike lanes deeply concerning.\nThe Importance of Bike Lanes for Safety and Mobility Bike lanes provide a safer means for cyclists to navigate urban spaces, reducing the risk of collisions and promoting a culture of active transportation. Cutting the creation of new lanes would force more cyclists onto dangerous roadways, where they must compete with vehicles for space. This proposal, therefore, would endanger vulnerable road users, including children, the elderly, and those who cannot afford cars. Bike lanes reduce crashes and fatalities for all road users and make the roadway more comfortable for both motor vehicle drivers and people riding bicycles (https://www.cazbike.org/bike-lanes-make-roads-safer-for-all-road-users/) Encourage bicycle riders to stay off the sidewalk.\nBike Lanes as a Critical Solution to Climate Change With climate change accelerating, there has never been a more critical time to support sustainable transportation. Cycling is a zero-emission mode of transport that helps reduce traffic congestion, lowers greenhouse gas emissions, and improves air quality. As governments and citizens worldwide are working toward ambitious climate goals, Ontario should be doing the same by promoting more\u2014not fewer\u2014safe options for cycling.\nBike Lanes Improve the Flow of Traffic Cyclists are legally permitted to occupy a vehicle lane, which can slow down traffic. However, when dedicated bike lanes are available, cyclists are separated from motor vehicles, allowing for a smoother and more efficient flow of traffic. Moreover, more people on bikes and fewer in single-occupancy cars means that bike lanes can carry significantly more people than traditional car lanes. By reducing the number of cars on the road, bike lanes are an essential component of any strategy to improve traffic flow and create a more efficient, less congested transportation system. Studies found that both motor vehicle drivers and bicyclists prefer separated bike lanes.\nA Livable Future Depends on Reducing Car Dependency Cities around the world are prioritizing active transportation, reducing reliance on private cars, and making streets safer and more welcoming for cyclists and pedestrians. To propose that car lanes should be preserved at the expense of bike lanes is to ignore the progress being made toward healthier, more vibrant, and economically resilient urban centers. Reducing car dependency is not just an environmental imperative but a public health one as well.\nEquity for All Road Users A transportation system that works for everyone must provide safe, affordable, and accessible options for all. Marginalized communities, including lower-income individuals, disproportionately rely on active transportation modes such as cycling. Bike lanes increase mobility for all citizens, and dismantling the progress made to expand this network would exacerbate inequities in our cities.\nIn closing, I strongly urge the Ontario government to reconsider this regressive proposal. By prioritizing cycling infrastructure, we can build safer, more sustainable, and more inclusive communities that benefit everyone. The future of our cities, our health, and our environment depends on it.\n"

        "comment": "In my experience as a cyclist in Ottawa, being in a traffic lane WITH cars causes gridlock and slows vehicles down.  While there are streets in Ottawa where bike lanes are not possible (Wellington St W, for example) there are many areas where a bike lane would REDUCE traffic congestion as well as create a safer environment for cyclists.  On Merivale Road, for example, I wind up riding on the sidewalk in places because it's NOT safe to be on the actual road if you are on a bike.  But, in that case, I am putting pedestrians at risk as well as riding illegally.  How is this bill addressing those issues?  Yes, we can take side streets where the traffic is lighter and I do so whenever possible.  But sometimes I need to go on a busier street to get home.\nAs well, bike lanes end abruptly at times when crossing from one side of a street to the other side.  There is literally nowhere for you to go except into traffic.  When vehicles are not paying attention, you are putting yourself at risk as well as the driver of the vehicle, if you pull into the traffic lane.\nI commute by ebike regularly to work during the warmer weather.  Every day when I get on my bike, as much as I am conscientious about sharing the road and as much as I enjoy riding, I have anxiety about my ride and whether or not I will arrive safely.  THIS is unfair.\nI am reducing congestion by riding and not using my car and adding to traffic woes.  When I am not riding, I use OC Transpo to get to work which also reduces congestion on the roads.\nReducing bike lanes is NOT decreasing congestion.  Adding bike trails completely separated from vehicle traffic would be a great alternative.  In lieu of bike lanes, is there a plan to increase bike trails?\n"

I think if Doug ford spent a little more time at the Gym and worked on walking around a little bit more, then he would not be so addicted to his car with some Air Conditioning to cool his fat ass, that he might actually get some Governing done. At this point he has only cost money, cancelled green initiatives, and gotten a little bit fatter, I wouldn't believe he's gotten fatter, but he loves the camera so much there is no avoiding how pleasantly plump her truly is.\nAnyway, we need more bike lanes, not less. We need more walking paths as well, and we need to start thinking RATIONALLY as opposed to IRRATIONALLY.\nThank you.\n"

        "comment": "I am opposed to this proposed bill. The local roadways should be managed by the municipality.\nThis proposal creates unnecessary red tape and is an intrusion into the rights and powers of municipalities to manage themselves.\nI'm a driver myself, and believe that decisions should be evidenced based that would serve the greater good.\nI hate passing cyclists on the road, while I understand it is the only safe place for them to get from one place to another it is a hazard to both cyclists and drivers. Traffic has only gotten busier and more dangerous now with the incredible amount of delivery drivers on the road riding electric bikes.\nWhile cycling in New Jersey, Johnny Gaudreau and his brother Matthew Gaudreau both hockey players, were struck and killed  by a drunk driver while sharing a single lane road way. Had there been a dedicated bike lane, or better yet dedicated trails for them to ride on, this tragedy could have been avoided. This tragic loss is reason why we should be open to appropriating designated lanes for pedestrians (side walks), for cyclists and e-bikes (bike lanes), and for cars.\nI firmly believe that taking away bike lanes or bike lane projects will not solve traffic problems and will create more harm than good. The province should not have the powers to override municipal decisions. Instead of exercising legislative powers, the government should instead exercise diplomacy and dialogue on evidence based foundations.\n"

        "comment": "My wife and I live near Yonge St in the Summerhill area. It used to be a nice place to live in the heart of the city. Sadly that has been dramatically changed with the addition of the bike lanes and all the curbs, plastic sticks, painted roads and signs that come with them. There are many, many issues with the resulting chaos caused by the unbearable congestion. Virtually every street is clogged with cars going nowhere, honking and spewing more emissions than necessary.\nThe bike lanes are under utilized, and many of the bikes themselves are (delivery) e-bikes going way too fast with little regard for the rules of the road, let alone using common courtesy, and will jump to the sidewalk when it suits them. It\u2019s dangerous for them, for pedestrians and for drivers who can\u2019t see them coming out of nowhere on their left side. It\u2019s a whole new kind of road rage.\nFinally, with traffic at a standstill, how are emergency vehicles supposed to get through, when seconds count, to say nothing about the sirens themselves blasting for far too long because they can\u2019t move.\nWinter\u2019s coming; we\u2019ll have no bikes for months, but the traffic will still be going nowhere, clogging the streets, honking and spewing more emissions. Please remove these lanes from Yonge street in particular; there are many other less important streets that would even be safer for cyclists and fix this madness in midtown. And please listen to the vast, vast majority of us that want their city to be more accommodating, sensible and yes, less unsightly too.\nJG.\n"

Smaller municipalities will be impacted most severely, being unable to afford the studies required to make even minor, sensible changes. Why are bicycle lanes being targeted specifically in this bill? Why not curbside parking? Why not construction? Why not bus lanes? Why not any other reason for reducing a motor vehicle travel lane? Why is motor vehicle travel time the only metric being considered? Why not bicycle travel time? Why not pedestrian safety? GHG emissions? Noise? Transit travel time? This bill is embarrassing.

        "comment": "This bill as it pertains to bicycle lanes is a terrible government overreach as well as a completely ineffective way to tackle gridlock and traffic. Bike lanes offer far more capacity for traffic compared to the small amount of space they require and they encourage people to use alternative modes of transport which reduces the number of cars on the road.\nBut lets move onto some of the more serious issues with this bill. The naked attempt to circumvent the Environmental Assessment Act in order to build highway 413 at the absolute lowest cost possible is a slap in the face to every Ontarian. Safety and environmental impacts cannot be overlooked in favour of trying to save money, especially not after the debacle of selling off parts of the Greenbelt. Not only that but the bill will also strip away bargaining power for engineers working on the highway who are already woefully underpaid.\nTo be clear, I unequivocally oppose this bill.\n"

And overstepping on the side of the Ontario government.

Why should tens of people have the right to infringe on the movement of thousands?  Including bicyclists.  Toronto is a major city, people need to move into parking garages, and off of the streets for parking.\n"
