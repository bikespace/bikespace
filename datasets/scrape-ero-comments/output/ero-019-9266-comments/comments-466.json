        "comment": "Removing bike lanes to widen roads is a terrible idea. There is NO research to show that this act improves traffic flow, in fact all the research shows that the wider the road, the more traffic builds. This has been demonstrated over and over again in many cities and countries.\nEncouraging active transportation removes congestion from cars and speeds transit times for vehicles.\nThe province does not and can not understand the road complexities in every city and town in Ontario. This is municipal territory and should be left that way.\nEven business groups support improved and extended bike lanes as they experience improved business when this is the case.\nAs a cyclist, it's already so dangerous to ride around the city. Many cyclists die every year. This is unacceptable. Bike lanes should be made safer, not removed.\nThe safer and more numerous the bike lanes, the more people will use them, and the traffic flow for cars will improve.\nRemoving bike lanes is a waste of taxpayers money, and businesses will also suffer from reduced traffic\n"

On top of that, the better our biking infrastructure gets, the more people will decide to bike instead of driving, therefore ending up with better traffic, not worse!

        "comment": "The proposal to remove bike lanes is incredibly short sighted and does not look to the future of the city.  There have been a number of studies that show bike lanes do not worsen gridlock. This move would only serve a minority of people who feel they are inconvenienced because they cannot take their preferred road through the city because it takes an extra 10 mins of travel time.\nIf anything the government would do better to promote biking as a fast cheap and healthy alternative to getting around the city.  That would be a government that actually cares for the people it represents instead of business interests and special interest groups.\nNot to mention of the wasted taxpayers money.  These bike lanes are just being completed and now the province wants to tear them up? Complete waste from a supposed conservative government that \"respects\" the tax payer.  SHAME! Such hypocrisy!\n"

I am both a motorist and a cyclist, and I do not support the province overstepping its boundaries by unilaterally deciding what they think is best for both motorists and cyclists in our cities. Leave it up to the cities to decide. We should be supporting all forms of transport, not only encouraging motorized vehicles. This would be a huge step backward for our cities.\n"

        "comment": "I believe this proposal is extremely misplaced. Municipalities are in the best position to make decisions on local transit options. The addition and inclusion of bike lanes provides a flexible, safe and green alternative to cars for transportation. Additionally, research has repeatedly shown that widening roads makes congestion worse. Well designed bike lanes can reduce congestion by making biking more appealing, in addition to promoting more foot traffic for local businesses. If this proposal goes through as planned it will be a step backwards, moving us further away from the more sustainable future we should all be striving for.\n"

The money used to remove bike lanes could be invested in better/safer bike infrastructure or into public transit (which are both evidence backed ways to reduce traffic). Not to mention: the time it will take to remove the lanes will create more construction in the city -just like adding the lanes did, but at least one made the city safer and more usable-.\n"

        "comment": "Mississauga is a worse Toronto. Toronto is known for its transportation and high density units. Other hot spots like Vancouver and Montreal share these same qualities. Parts of Europe and East Asia are absolutely destroying us when it comes to transportation and urban planning. We have plenty of models to learn from and implement ourselves but we don't. We finally get some expansions into non-motor vehicle transportation and the first thing you want to do is remove it? The urban sprawl Mississauga is designed after is financially unsustainable. Longer roads just mean more upkeep, more roads just mean even more upkeep, and the the taxpayer is supposed to cover this? The city has to grow to cover the cost but more growth means more cost to cover, it's a dog chasing its own tail. You speak of building another highway, for what? To make up for the absolute blunder that was leasing the 407 for 99 years? 99 years?! Is this copyright law?! So when things aren't working your solution is to do more of it? Am I understanding that correctly? Because it seems to be the only play in your playbook. In short, I don't support this is any capacity. And since you clearly have time and funding, you should use it to come up with NEW solutions instead of the same old tricks that have been run into the ground time and time again. This is not the first new road/highway built nor is it the first lane expansion, but it's always the same \"oh, but if we just add another one, it will fix the problem.\" It's always been a bandage fix and then the problem comes right back. And we have this same conversation again, pretending like it's the first time. Do something different. Bike lanes on main roads that people use to go to places they want to go without having to use a car and get stuck in traffic? Actually different. If you want to address congestion, instead of doing things that make you feel better in the short-term, how bout trying solutions that actually work long-term. Again we have plenty of cities on this blue planet that we can draw inspiration from. This rat race your running isn't sustainable.\n"

        "comment": "I am not a bicycle rider any more owing to my age, but I still regularly drive my car and use public transportation. I live downtown on Bloor Street, where bike lanes currently exist and are highly used. I am hereby expressing my great concern about the proposals for removing existing bike lanes. Research has shown that bike lanes do not increase gridlock, but rather lessen car traffic . They also provide alternative mobility without adding to pollution. The Ontario Government's plan to remove bike lanes presents many negative aspects: a wasteful use of taxpayers' money first to install and then to remove these lanes; showing no concern about pollution and climate change; encouraging more car traffic in a city that is already overwhelmed by this. I am also very concerned about the Ontario Government's meddling in municipal planning decisions, especially those that have already been well researched by the city's government. I would ask the Ontario Government to use its resources for improving and increasing public transportation, so that drivers can have other choices than cars for travelling within the GTA. In summary, I strongly request that you don't touch the bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "I am a resident of Toronto. I own and operate a car as well as using a bicycle.  I want to be explicitly clear and succinct: This bill does not meet the needs of Ontarians. Not only is it not good for cyclists, it is not good for drivers. The proposal to remove the bike lanes on Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue is *scandalous* and this bill should be immediately withdrawn.\nI say this not as a cyclist but a driver. When I drive in Toronto, I want cyclists to be *safe* and *separated* from me as I drive--never in the same lane as me. My *favourite* streets to drive are in fact the roads which have cycle lanes, and particuarly those that have fully separated lanes (such as Bloor, but preferably College) where I do not have to concern myself with cyclists apart from at intersections, where I am concerned for pedestrians anyway.\nIt is rank foolishness to believe that removing these lanes or stopping new lanes will somehow affect \"gridlock\". For one, cyclists *will still use theses streets.* With shops and destinations on them, they will become \"desire paths\" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desire_path) for cyclists even if they are replaced with less direct cycle paths elsewhere, leading to a huge amount of disruption only to make cyclists and drivers less safe.\nIn addition, I do not believe that such a change would make any difference. First: assume all cyclists in the city suddenly stopped cycling. What do they do instead to commute? are you telling me we want one more car on the street for every cyclist? How will that help gridlock?\nAs a driver, do you want to know what *actually* makes it harder to get around the city? On-street parking! There are so many areas of Toronto where cars, trucks and more are parked, and once the lanes are gone the space where they were will just be, guess what, replaced with parked cars! Why not remove all on-street parking if you're so concerned? As a driver, I literally never use it, instead parking in lots.\nI also believe that the city should not require provincial approval for new bike lanes. Again, *as a driver* I want bike lanes all across the city because *I do not want bikes in the same lane as me.* I also fully believe that more bike lanes will lead to less congestion because *more people will use them* decreasing the number of cars on the road.\nThis bill is a grotesque waste of provincial time that will only lead to a huge waste of funds on ripping out lanes and even more gridlock. I'm stunned that I have to even write this.\n"

        "comment": "While I understand that traffic congestion can be challenging, it is a municipal responsibility. I strongly feel that the province intervening is an overreach that weakens democracy.  Municipalities are best placed to understand traffic situations in their communities.\nSecondly, it has been repeatedly been shown that adding roadways adds rather than decreases traffic so this strategy is doomed to fail, while also increasing emmisions at a time when we should be reducing vehicle use to address climate change.  Indeed forward looking cities increase active and public transportion options and discourage vehicular traffic through congestion charges and other mechanisms.  I would be very proud to live in an Ontario that adopted such strategies.\nLastly as a public health professional, I strongly promote active transportation.  Healthier citizens will decrease health care costs, albeit over time but that is no reason to discourage it by making cycling more challenging and dangerous.\n"

        "comment": "I am a working student downtown. The many bike lanes across downtown are extremely important for my day to day comunte. I currently go out of my way to use the bike lines on university ave and bloor St because of there quality of pavement and security I feel when using them. When I lived near bloor I had many near crashes because cars would encroach on the bike lane and potholes on the street. The new bike lines have fixed these issues by creating solid concrete barriers between cars and the bike lanes. The protected intersections have given me more confedance to use the roads.\nI use the bike lanes every day to get to school and work as well as for leisure activities with friends. I try to avoid streets like spadina because of there lack of cycling infrastructure.\nIf the bike lanes were removed I would seriously think of switching to using a car causing more traffic in the downtown core.\nThe current bike infrastructure on bloor and university are extremely important to me and are the safest I've ever felt while cycling in the city.\n"

        "comment": "The decision by the provincial government to remove existing bicycle lanes and to require provincial approval to install new ones demonstrates a complete lack of understanding or disinterest in the actual movement of people and traffic.  It is also a cynical and deeply undemocratic decision.\nRemoving bike lanes, and presumably bikes, will only increase automobile traffic, increasingly grid lock.\nRemoving bike lanes will remove protection from bike riders and people will be injured and die.  This includes urban workers, particularly in the down town areas the provincial government claims to want to support such as bike couriers and delivery people.\nPeople who don't  have cars or can't afford cars will have limited access to transportation, especially given the sad state or public transportation.\nIn rural areas, bike lanes have been a draw for tourists.  They're removal suggests that the provincial government is primarily interested in encouraging polluting automobiles.\n"
