        "comment": "This proposal is so incredibly ill-conceived. There seems to be an assumption (not backed by data) that bike lanes are the cause of vehicle traffic congestion, rather than looking at this infrastructure as a more space-saving way to move people through the city.  Toronto is the fastest growing city in North America.  We will never be able to move all people (or goods) that are here now, let alone the projected additional million people coming to our city, in single-occupancy vehicles (cars).  The City - supported by the province - needs to support alternative methods to get around on foot, on bicycles and on public transit.   If there is not safe infrastructure, we will not be able to make this shift and vehicle traffic will just continue to worsen as population increases and the city gets more densely populated.\nAs a regular user of the bike lanes on Bloor Street, as well as a regular car driven in the same area, these lanes provide a safe opportunity to move around the city when I cycle and delineate a clear separation of use when I'm driving a car. To put my and other cyclist's safety at risk to save a few minutes driving time? Shame.\nIt is fiscally irresponsible to put funding - and require the City of Toronto to support - toward removal of this infrastructure that was so recently installed at costs that were in the millions.\nSuch bad city planning and such terrible use of resources.\nI do not support this proposed legislation.\n"

        "comment": "The Ford government\u2019s intervention in bike lane policy is a direct consequence of local failures - from Kitchener to Ottawa and from Hamilton to the GTA. In Toronto, the case of Bloor Street West stands out, where councillors Amber Morley, Gord Perks, Mayor Olivia Chow, and the head of transportation services, Barbara Gray, have consistently ignored their constituents\u2019 concerns.\nThe issue isn\u2019t bike lanes themselves, but the reckless manner in which they\u2019ve been implemented. These local leaders forged ahead without adequately consulting those affected\u2014residents and businesses. The resulting chaos and congestion were obvious from the moment the lanes were installed, casually dismissed as mere teething pains. Many voiced valid concerns about the outcome, but these warnings were largely brushed aside during the planning and approval stages. The disregard for community input left the door wide open for provincial intervention.\n"

        "comment": "The bike lanes on Bloor have completely disrupted this wonderful neighbourhood. I never see anyone cycling on these lanes - they are completely useless in this area.\nAs a result of putting these lanes, traffic has gotten completely worse and out of control. The amount of cars now disrupting side streets that used to be quiet and safe to walk with young kids - is no longer.\nThese lanes are a result of loud voices who represent an extremely small population in the city. A lot of them have a liberal agenda - not a common sense approach to how to ensure a city runs efficiently and effectively.\nI support removing these bike lanes immediately - regardless of the cost!\n"

        "comment": "I am a resident of the City of Ottawa and have participated in consultations on the city's new Official Plan and Transportation Master Plan over the past five years. These plans have been designed with care and consultation and support building a city that moves people more efficiently and effectively using a variety of modes of transportation. Road safety has also been a priority for me and for the city.\nIt is disappointing to see the provincial government trying to override this carefully crafted plans, which have also received the required provincial approval, for reasons that are not supported by data or evidence.\nOur cities have to change to meet the current and future needs of the population. We no longer live in a world where everyone can own or drive a car everywhere they need to go (not that we ever did). There simply is not enough space for it. I prefer to bike - it makes my life easier especially with two young children who need to get to school and daycare, but I will not do so when it is unsafe. Having protected cycling infrastructure is essential to reducing congestion.\nPlease listen to the incredible amounts of evidence, expertise, and personal experiences before you. Engineers, planners, municipalities, developers, healthcare professionals, researchers have all sent letters providing details and reasoning. I also do not support my tax dollars being spent on a wasteful project in Toronto that citizens and the mayor there do not support. Stay in your lane.\n"

I own a home and a small business, each is located near or on separate bike lane-accessible locations in the city and it has been GREAT to see so many people using them. I am both a cyclist and a driver, and of course due to both the owner of a home and a business I am also a significant tax payer. Spending even a penny on the removal of existing infrastructure is too much!\n"

        "comment": "I am both a cyclist and a driver, but I oppose putting in bike lanes on major roads in Toronto. Our city has enough congestion and removing car lanes to put in bike lanes is not fair and does not take into account the reality of traffic in Toronto today. Our climate does not allow for cyclists to operate 365 days of the year, so there are  times when bike lanes are not used at all. Cars, on the other hand, are on the road every day, in 99% of weather conditions and at all times of the day and night.\nStatistics seem to indicate that businesses thrive and bike traffic is up when bike lanes are installed, but I sincerely question those statistics.\nAt present, those of us who drive gasoline powered cars pay for road maintenance at the gas pump. Drivers of electric cars and cyclists do not. I find this very unfair. The hard-core cyclists are not contributing to their exclusive lanes.\n"

        "comment": "We need to have a moratorium on highway building, we have done quite well to this day without highway 413, and the Bradford Bypass, which will only add to greenhouse gas emissions.\nRegarding section 195.2, bike lanes are an important component to safe commuting, it provides a safe place for cyclists to get around the city.\nIf cycling numbers are low, it is because so far there has not been reasonable cycling infrastucture in the city of Toronto or many other cities for people to feel safe enough, lack of lanes has been an impediment to more riding.\nI believe it is an overreach of the provincial government to meddle in bicycle lanes quantity, location etc, and is best left to cities themselves.\nPrioritizing motor vehicles over all other transport and road uses, is uneffective and dangerous, as cars, for the most part destroy cities, how many buildings have been lost to surface parking?\nToo many people are killed by motorists due to bad road design that prioritize motor vehicles over all other (more efficient) forms of transport.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is harmful in an untold number of ways. Not only will it not reduce gridlock or save me time, but it will cost significant amounts of money, and destroy vital public infrastructure that I use on a daily basis. If the government was interested in making our commutes easier, safer, and faster, they would explore measures that remove cars from the road entirely.\nThe government should entirely and completely abandon this plan, and reinvest the millions of dollars to further fund our existing public transit infrastructure. Expand GO Services to encourage more people in the GTA to take buses and trains over driving. Increase grants to municipalities for adding - not removing - bicycle infrastructure, bus lanes, LRT routes, and other local public transit options. The easiest, safest, and greenest way to reduce traffic is to have fewer cars on the road.\nPlease put the safety and futures of our communities first, and do not move forward with Bill 212.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes increase safety for cyclists, which not only helps reduce congestion by reducing the number of cars on the road, but also helps reduce carbon emissions, and encourages physical fitness in the population. They also help reduce stress on low-income populations by allowing those who do not own cars to move through the area. Additionally, there is little evidence to suggest that additional traffic lanes would increase the throughput of a road during peak hours. I would in no case advocate for the removal of a bike lane to increase traffic lanes.\nInstead of adding more lanes to roads in an inevitably unsuccessful attempt to decrease congestion, this citizen would advise the Ontario government to invest the money into proven and efficient methods of transportation, such as light rail or busses.\n"

        "comment": "Doug Ford and the Ontario Government\u2019s decision to prevent the installation of new bike lanes and to remove existing ones, as per Bill 212, exemplifies that\n\u2022\tYou believe that Ontarians\u2019 lives are disposable: By preventing future bike lanes and actively removing existing bike lanes you are prioritizing convenience of some over the safety and lives of others. What you are saying is that someone saving 10 minutes on their commute is worth more than my life. How do you decide how much \u2018time saved\u2019 a human life is worth?\n\u2022\tYou don\u2019t care about taxpayers\u2019 dollars: You are spending millions of taxpayers\u2019 dollars to remove newly installed infrastructure - which already cost millions of dollars. You are flushing our money and infrastructure down the toilet, and charging us all to watch. How do your constituents outside of the GTA feel about your fiscal irresponsibility? How do you convince them that their tax dollars are better spent on this than on services that will directly and positively impact them, like housing and healthcare?\n\u2022\tYou are short-sighted: Removing bike lanes focuses on instant-gratification without any consideration of long-term consequences. Downtown has a finite capacity to accommodate cars, and removing bike lanes is not going to address this. Cycling, on the other hand, is an alternate means of transportation that can address the problem of congestion due to car traffic in a more sustainable fashion. Instead of wasting taxpayer money on short-sighted and low-yield interventions like removing bike lanes, focus on sustainable solutions like improving transit services.\n\u2022\tYou don\u2019t care about evidence informed decision making: The decision to prevent and remove bike lanes ignores the research that has demonstrated their various benefits. Research shows that cycling infrastructure, like the protected bike lanes on University Ave, Bloor St and Yonge St, reduces the risk of cyclists being hit and injured by cars. It has also shown that the installation of bike lanes can actually reduce travel times by car, and improve customer traffic in local businesses. Where is the data that justifies the prevention and removal of bike lanes? Where is the data that justifies placing vulnerable road users at risk of harm?\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nI am strongly against the proposal to remove bike lanes from Bloor St., Yonge St., and University Ave. I live in the Danforth area and am a regular cyclist. I heavily rely on those bike lanes, particularly the lanes on Bloor, to get around the city quickly and safely by bike.\nWhen I first moved to the city 9 years ago, I rarely cycled, both due to safety concerns about riding on busy streets, and not wanting to take an extremely roundabout route via quieter side streets. But now there is so much more and safer bike infrastructure in the city that it has become my preferred mode of transport. I am also clearly not alone in this, as I have never been alone as a cyclist using those lanes. No matter what hour of the day, there is always at least one other cyclist using the lanes around me, and during peak travel hours, the lanes are absolutely packed with cyclist commuters.\nRemoving these bike lanes will dramatically worsen traffic in the short term (due to construction), and will not improve traffic in the long term. More drivers will use these streets if they perceive them to be faster, and traffic will swiftly return to the current state of gridlock. I invite Premier Doug Ford and Transportation Minister Prabmeet Sarkaria to Google the term \"induced demand\" at their earliest convenience in order to learn why this proposal is a shortsighted and poorly thought out idea.\nFinally, I would ask that the Ford government stick to their own lane and not interfere with local concerns. Citizens voted for these bike lanes, and they have the full support of elected Toronto representatives. There is absolutely no need to pass provincial legislation affecting every Ontario city's ability to install their own bike lanes, simply because Doug Ford wants a faster commute to Queen's Park.\nSincerely,\nA cyclist concerned for their safety\n"

Since they have been installed my commute time has doubled and my heart breaks every time I see an emergency vehicle stuck as cars have no where to pull over - I have seen this often!\nThe animosity between cyclists and drivers has increased 10 fold not to mention the unsightly installation of white sticks along what used to be a beautiful street.    I have lived in this neighbourhood all my life and currently own a home in Sunnylea.   Please restore our beautiful Bloor and help move traffic again.\n"
