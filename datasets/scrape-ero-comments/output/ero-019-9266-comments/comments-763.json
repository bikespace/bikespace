        "comment": "It is disappointing to see that we are moving backwards here in Ontario, trying to go back in time in stead of moving foreword. Ontario needs to move forewords by implementing new radical ideas. Ontario is lagging behind on public transport and bike infrastructure, but the cost of living/driving has never been higher. If we want to believe that Ontario is a place where people can make a life for themselves without needing an inheritance, we should be making it possible for more people to be able to travel to work without needing a vehicle. The cost is too high, environmentally and financially. Ontario needs to look to the future and we need strong leaders to take us there. This bill is counterproductive and should not be passed. Please think of the future generations of people in Ontario and make the right decision.\n"

This legislation is deeply flawed and poses serious risks to public safety, health, and finances.\n- The claim that only 1.2% of Torontonians bike to work is NOT TRUE\u2014provincial data shows nearly 10% of trips ending downtown are by bike or micromobility.\n-The bill completely ignores \u201csafety\u201d and \u201chealth\u201d considerations, focusing solely on the \u201corderly movement of motor vehicle traffic\u201d when evaluating bike lanes.\n- The removal of these bike lanes is estimated to cost taxpayers $48 million.  How can the PC government in anyway think this is acceptable? I voted for Ford. If this goes through I will no longer be supporting the PC government.\nThis bill undermines proven infrastructure, wastes taxpayer money, and endangers lives. I urge you to reject it outright.\nPLEASE we are asking you do not go forward with this outrageous bill.\n"

And I often need to get back to Bloor West Village - I try to either walk or use public transportation but when I do need to drive I find that it is taking me often more then twice as long to get to Bloor & Runnymede then it did prior to the bike lane extension. This is a tremendous waste of time & energy and additional source of CO in the atmosphere. Often I do not see anyone using the bike lanes....but traffic is snarled. Why was this not evaluated before the money was spent.\n"

        "comment": "Ontario's Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, which aims to improve transportation infrastructure and reduce traffic congestion, is a proposal that may sound promising on the surface, but upon closer examination, it reveals several flaws that could worsen the problem it seeks to address and ultimately lead to long-term negative consequences.\n1. Overemphasis on Expanding Road Infrastructure\nOne of the central components of the Act is the expansion of road networks and highways to alleviate gridlock. While this may seem like a direct solution to traffic problems, it fails to account for the well-established phenomenon of induced demand. This concept suggests that simply building more roads encourages more people to drive, which can actually increase congestion in the long run. Rather than reducing gridlock, expanding infrastructure often leads to even worse traffic as more vehicles take advantage of the newly constructed lanes, quickly filling them up. This cycle of endless road expansion is not a sustainable solution and could ultimately lead to a \u201cbigger is worse\u201d situation.\n2. Environmental Impact and Urban Sprawl\nThe Act\u2019s focus on road-building and expanding highways also overlooks the environmental consequences of such projects. More roads lead to greater carbon emissions, which is a direct contradiction to Ontario\u2019s climate goals. The construction and maintenance of highways require significant energy and materials, and increased car usage contributes to air pollution and worsens the province's carbon footprint. Additionally, expanding highways encourages urban sprawl, as more land is developed for new housing, businesses, and industries along major roadways. This sprawl can diminish green spaces, harm ecosystems, and increase the pressure on municipal services in new suburban areas.\n3. Neglecting Public Transit and Active Transportation\nThe Act\u2019s focus on roads and highways overlooks the crucial role of public transportation and active transportation (e.g., walking and cycling) in solving gridlock. For Ontario to truly reduce traffic congestion and improve quality of life, the government needs to prioritize investments in transit systems, such as buses, subways, and commuter trains. Expanding these systems would provide Ontarians with viable alternatives to driving, reducing the overall number of vehicles on the road. The Act should also place a stronger emphasis on creating safe cycling lanes and pedestrian pathways to encourage active modes of transport. By neglecting these areas, the government is not addressing the underlying need for sustainable transportation solutions.\n4. Lack of Focus on Congestion Pricing and Demand Management\nInstead of simply building more roads, Ontario should explore solutions that manage traffic demand. Measures like congestion pricing, which charges vehicles to enter high-traffic areas during peak hours, have proven effective in cities around the world, such as London and New York. The Act misses this opportunity to implement more sophisticated strategies to reduce congestion in a way that encourages people to take public transit or adjust their travel habits. Without addressing demand management, the province risks continuing to support a car-dependent culture, which exacerbates gridlock rather than alleviating it.\n5. Impact on Local Communities and Quality of Life\nThe expansion of highways and road networks under this Act could have detrimental effects on local communities. New roads often pass through residential neighborhoods, leading to increased noise, pollution, and the disruption of local businesses. These communities may find themselves trapped between expanding highways and deteriorating environmental conditions, ultimately reducing their quality of life. Additionally, road expansion can lead to displacement of existing residents, particularly in underprivileged areas, who may be forced to relocate due to construction projects or gentrification driven by increased access to transportation corridors.\n6. Missed Opportunity for Innovative Solutions\nInstead of continuing with outdated and car-centric solutions, the Ontario government should be looking for more innovative transportation alternatives. This could include increasing investment in shared mobility services like carpooling, ride-hailing, and autonomous vehicles. There is also potential to integrate smart traffic management systems that can reduce congestion by optimizing traffic flow. These technologies are not given enough attention in the Act, which suggests the government is still focused on old models of transportation infrastructure that may no longer be the most effective in addressing modern challenges.\nConclusion\nWhile the Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act proposes a solution to Ontario's traffic problems, its heavy reliance on expanding road infrastructure and neglect of alternative transportation options are shortsighted and ineffective in the long run. The government\u2019s focus on road construction is likely to exacerbate traffic congestion, contribute to environmental degradation, and encourage urban sprawl. To truly solve Ontario's gridlock issues, the government should prioritize sustainable transportation solutions, such as investing in public transit, improving active transportation infrastructure, and adopting congestion pricing and demand management strategies. Without these measures, the Act risks perpetuating the very problems it intends to resolve.\n"

        "comment": "Time to reduce the number of bike lanes. I\u2019ve personally seen EMS vehicles stuck and unable to move on Willowdale Ave because half of each lane has been removed for bike lanes. The curbs don\u2019t allow for any wiggle room for these vehicles. In the winter, the curbs make snow removal very difficult causing further traffic issues. I have counted many, many times, at all times day and night and the most I have ever seen travelling in the bike lanes are 3 bikes/scooters/ebikes. We cannot continue to put others at risk because of these highly underused, nuisance lanes.\n"

        "comment": "The proposal of Bill 212 will not have the impact that some think will have. The only way to reduce car traffic is to reduce the number of cars by giving people more choices on how they get around safely in a city. This has been proven over time and time again. The principal if induced demand means that people will take the transportation method presented to them. If driving is the only option, then everyone will drive.  If other options such as cycling, some will drive and some will cycle.  Bike lanes are much more efficient at moving the same number of people.  Most cars on the road only have one occupant, but take up much more space than a cyclist.\nPeople using bike lanes in the city are not just doing it for recreation. They are doing to get to and from destinations.  Those destinations are schools, work, doctor\u2019s appointments, groceries and other errands.  The same destinations where someone would drive to.\nWith regards to winter, people also bike year-round provided that bike lanes are plowed. If you don\u2019t plow roads, people won\u2019t be able to drive. The same applies to bike lanes.\nTraffic management in a city is a city issue, not a provincial issue. However this goes beyond traffic congestion.  It\u2019s a safety issue.  If safe cycling infrastructure is removes, people who continue to bike will be forced into traffic with cars.  Their safety and well-being will be put at risk.  They will need to take up space in the main travel lane, drivers will get even more frustrated and cause more danger to everyone.\nTrust me, no cyclists want to ride in the same travel lane as cars. It isn\u2019t safe and a very unpleasant experience.\nI attached a few links. One is a youtube video titled \u201cThe Best Country in the World for Drivers\u201d.  Spoilers it is the Netherlands because they provide people with different options to drive.  Amsterdam used to be a very congested city, but they solved that problem by reducing the dependence on cars.\nThe end link is from CAA, the Canadian Automobile Association, about \u201cCongestion Solutions for Canada\u201d  Bike infrastructure, encouraging active transportation are talked about multiple times as part of the solution to the congestion problem.\nIf Bill 212 goes ahead, bike lanes are removed and there is no change in traffic congestion or is actually worse, what will the province do then?  What will be blamed for the traffic congestion?\n"

Was there any thought of how these bike lanes would impact accessibility for disabled people or seniors?  Parking spaces are tight. When you park your car,  you literally open your car into traffic . There is not enough space. On the passenger side you have the same situation but with bike traffic.\nLast week I witnessed  a very close call . Somebody was dropping off an elderly passenger on Bloor st near Royal york . They pulled over into a parking space and the elderly passenger got out from the passenger side of the vehicle that put them  directly into the bike lane path. A bike was travelling down the path and nearly struck the pedestrian. It is not safe.  Normally you would have a curb right next to the passenger side of the vehicle. Did council not consider these potential safety issues?\nYou can just install bike lanes everywhere. It has to make sense. It is not a one size fits all scenario\n"

Normally a 15 minute drive takes easily 30 minutes or more. That's a lot of idling traffic which is much worse for the environment.\nParking in the area is extremely limited now which impacts all the businesses. Also, with all that traffic, people don't want to drive in that - so restaurants are getting impacted. I've seen a sharp decline in guests as I frequent these establishments.\nI rarely see bikes between Islington and Prince Edward. So the lanes aren't really getting used. There are plenty of side streets where they can ride along. Also, the subway is right there so they can take their bikes on the subway.\nWhoever approved these bike lanes really didn't do enough research. It is a visual and therefore a visceral betrayal.\n"

        "comment": "I particularly take issue with Schedule 3 and Schedule 4 of Bill 212.\nSchedule 3 provides exemption from the Environmental Assessment Act for the construction of Highway 413. I do not believe that the construction of Highway 413 should be exempt from the Environmental Assessment Act. What's the point of enforcing environmental assessments if we just simply ignore it for one of the largest infrastructure project?\nFurthermore, the 401 is already North America's busiest highway, with 18 lanes at the widest. Especially when in the past the 407 has already been constructed for this express purpose (which was then unwisely sold off). The amount of money and environmental impact in the construction of this highway is monumental, and I believe a better use of the money could be found. From both a financial and environmental perspective, I believe that either purchasing or subsidizing the 407 would be a better idea if the goal is to direct traffic away from the 401.\nThe main issue I have with Schedule 4 of Bill 212 concerns the requirement for municipalities to require Ministry approval for bike lanes. On a philosophical level, I do not believe that the province should have undue say in municipal affairs, and I believe that this crosses a line. On a practical level, this would slow down the construction of bike lanes, and discourage bike lanes in the province. Bicycles serve a purpose as a mode of transit, and I do not believe that discouraging bike use is a wise choice.\n"
