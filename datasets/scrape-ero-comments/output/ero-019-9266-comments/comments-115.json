        "comment": "This bill is an overreach of provincial government over municipal issues. This is not supported by evidence.\nAs a driver and cyclist this does not make any sense. Side roads are design for local traffic, cyclist will use the most direct roads, if you eliminate bike lanes in major roads all those cyclist are going to be still there but taking a whole lane as they are fully entitled to do under the Ontario Highway Traffic Act.\nStop blaming cyclists for congestion. Congestion is due to poor infrastructure planning and delays in transit capacity building. I work along Eglinton Avenue, and I have to take 3 buses to go to work if I want to use transit. If the Eglinton LRT was completed me and thousand of my coworkers would be out of the road REDUCING CONGESTION, instead we are in cars and buses being part of congestion.\n"

        "comment": "I am a cycling commuter living in London who sometimes visits other municipalities such as Hamilton and Toronto. Cities in Ontario are overwhelmingly car-centric, contain public transportation networks of variable quality and efficiency (bus, BRT, subway, light rail, inter-municipal rail), and are still lagging behind with investing in cycling and scooter infrastructure and services. As for the latter, the more and better-quality protected bike lanes and multi-use paths along or near key arterials, the less vulnerable you make these road users. Furthermore, it seems that the main reasons some roads and streets are gridlocked during certain times of the day (whether in London or somewhere else) is... car-dependency, not so much a pesky bus or annoying bike lane. If new, high-density housing developments are approved, they should always be accompanied by an improvement or expansion of the public or active transportation networks. Otherwise, you are guaranteed to see automobile gridlock---more people coming and going from the same area without a viable alternative to personal vehicles, they're gonna become part of the traffic problem. Big sigh. Spending time in Toronto recently on a Friday evening sitting in an Uber needing to travel 3 km from A to B---that took 25 minutes. It was SUCH an inefficient way to get around a high density area. I wished with all my heart I had encouraged my work colleagues to use the bikeshare service with me. Enough of calling drivers victims for their long commute times. They (and your policies) are part of the problem we've had for decades now. Don't stop bike lanes from being added, stop incentivizing citizens to spend money and time against their own interests. Let's build a culture in Ontario where public and active transport are well-balanced with personal driving.\n"

        "comment": "This is a ridiculous proposal. Even as a driver it's obvious that bike lanes SAVE time. If there aren't bike lanes, the cyclists will still be on the road. The right lane will just become the de facto bike lane, slowing down traffic even more. On top of which, it's unnecessarily dangerous, and the removal of bike lanes will take construction that wastes even more time. This is not well thought out, the bill should not go through.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal poses a significant threat to the development of sustainable transportation infrastructure and undermines local decision-making. Prioritizing vehicle traffic over bike lanes runs counter to long-term efforts to reduce congestion, promote environmental sustainability, and improve public health.\n1.\tInhibiting Active Transportation: Requiring municipalities to seek provincial approval for bike lanes\u2014especially when removing vehicle lanes\u2014is a step backwards in promoting cycling as a viable and sustainable mode of transport. Cycling reduces traffic congestion and pollution and should be encouraged, not hindered.\n2.\tLocal Autonomy at Risk: Municipalities are in the best position to understand local traffic needs and dynamics. By centralizing the approval process, the province risks imposing blanket policies that may not fit the diverse contexts of Ontario\u2019s towns and cities. Local governments must retain the authority to implement transportation solutions tailored to their communities.\n3.\tEnvironmental Impact: While the proposal mentions environmental implications, prioritizing vehicle traffic over bike lanes conflicts with Ontario\u2019s climate goals. Encouraging car usage over cycling will likely result in increased carbon emissions and harm to urban air quality.\n4.\tPublic Health and Safety: Promoting cycling infrastructure has clear health benefits and can contribute to reducing healthcare costs. Expanding bike lanes should be viewed as an investment in public health and safety rather than a hindrance to traffic flow.\nInstead of imposing additional barriers on municipalities, the province should be actively encouraging and supporting the expansion of bike lane infrastructure as part of a broader strategy to reduce gridlock, improve environmental outcomes, and enhance the quality of life for Ontarians.\n"

        "comment": "I am a father of one and live downtown. I own a vehicle but during the course of the spring and summer, this city has excessive congestion and gridlock. This necessitated us to purchase bicycles which allow us to get around the city much faster, cut down on gas bills and helps do our part for environment. Part of the reason why we feel comfortable biking is because of the new bike lanes across the city. I feel safe biking with my 3yr old son knowing physical barrier seperate is and cars on the road. We utilize Richmond going west and Adelaide going east. If bike lanes are ripped out, yes we would gain an extra lane of traffic but many citizens such as myself, would revert to driving again, adding more vehicles to those reopened lanes. Toronto is densely populated with more condo projects being completed every year. Thy solution isn't more cars on the road but less.\n"

Adding provincial approval will needlessly delay projects, and ultimately result in even more government spending, for very, very little effect. Please let municipalities make these minor decisions on their own, and stick to finding solutions for province-wide issues like better land use policies that can reduce people's commutes.\nCouncillors are democratically elected, and if the public doesn't like a bike lane, they can vote to make their voices heard.\n"

The city and government need to do more to provide safe infrastructures for bikes and better public transit.\nMaybe take example from many European and North American cities and turn more streets into single lane, have the streetcar run on its own lane, reduce the amount of car in the city with a toll fee for cars.\nBike lanes are not the issue, the issue is the amount of cars in the city. The car lobbies are making it impossible to live in Toronto anymore. How many more cyclists have to die!!!\n"

        "comment": "It is thoroughly depressing in the year 2024 to read and hear government proposals that involve the ripping out of bike lanes in the supposed aim of \"getting drivers where they need to go faster\". The fact that this attitude is expressed in the legislature is astounding, and indicative of the car-first rather than people-first attitude of this government.\nAs background, I am British, lived in London (UK) from 2007 to 2021, but have lived in Ontario (Ottawa, then Toronto) since 2021.\nDuring my time living in London, I watched provision of bike lanes go from almost nothing, to painted lanes on the side of the road, to fully fledged protected bike lanes on major thoroughfares and at major intersections. During rush hour (ie. the most important time of day to keep things moving), you will see more bicycles at major intersections than people in motor vehicles. This is in addition to London's large and well run public transport system. London itself is well behind other major European cities, which have all experimented with varying levels of building more roads, public transport, bike lanes etc. and have all reached the conclusion that the best way to keep EVERYONE moving, is to have a proper mix of active transport, public transport, and vehicle transport.\nThe way to reduce the traffic pressure in Toronto (which is what this bill appears to be aimed at), is not to rip out bike lanes, but in fact to add more properly protected bike lanes to make the use of a bike more appealing to those who may be concerned about mixing with general traffic, and to push ahead with further expansions to the rail and public transport network. A quick look at Toronto's subway map compared with London, Paris, New York etc. should be of great embarrassment to both the province, and the city itself.\nIf the province really feels the need to compel Toronto to do something with its streets, it is hilarious that the target is bike lanes, rather than on street parking. It is bizarre to ride my bike or drive my car down some of the main streets in Toronto, and have a lane on each side of the road used for the parking of cars. The capacity of many roads could be literally doubled overnight by forcing drivers of cars (including myself) to park in lots, rather than on street. But no, it's bike lanes that are the problem.\nAs an addendum, it is absurd that the Minister of Transportation, according to a newspaper opinion piece he wrote, apparently elects to drive from his home in Brampton to his office in Toronto, rather than use public transport. This is exactly the sort of behaviour that increases traffic pressure, and leads to nonsense government policy.\nAs an attachment, I leave a video posted to Reddit showing how much easier it is for bicycles to clear the way for an emergency vehicle, as opposed to cars.\n"

        "comment": "The act misses an opportunity to delegate minimum standards for the creation of bike lanes in addition to driving lanes. The act should set tiers for level of service. One road, shall include space for a painted bike lane. Two lane roads shall provide a divided bike lane with barriers. Three lane roads should provide a separated bike lane or multi-use trail pathway.\nThe act could enforce municipalities to design better cycling infrastructure with a provincial mandate on complete streets urban design framework. Utilizing the work to produce the City of Toronto Complete Street guidelines.\nWith the municipalities of Oakville, Milton, Oshawa, Whitby, Kleinburg exploding with new development. We need the government to step in and ensure street design and urban planning are meeting new standards for safe and efficient streets. As the communities grow, the further the commute to Toronto and we need to ensure our roads are designed to move people safely.\nThe government needs to add a clause that reviews roadways, intersections, where a death has occurred and mitigate tge unsafe condition to ensure another death doesn\u2019t occur there again.\nDon\u2019t make this act just about cars and reduced traffic lanes but make it about mobility on congested and unsafe streets.\n"

        "comment": "As a user of cars, public transit and bike infrastructure across the province, I\u2019m not sure how this Act is meant to save us time.\nFirst, it\u2019s introducing a large amount of red tape for municipalities to manage their own streets by having to go through the provincial government which sounds like wasting more time on that front. The province should only be concerned with routes that go between municipalities within the province and not make it more difficult for municipalities to implement strategies for their own transportation solutions to problems they know best.\nSecondly, the focus on bike lanes specifically seems like an absurdly specific thing for the government to be focusing on, especially when considering that bikes aren\u2019t the primary mode of transportation used between municipalities. For an Act that\u2019s supposed to save commuters time, I see barely any mention of expediting public transit projects or any mention of encouraging the reduction of number of cars on the road - time is saved when there is less volume. Not to mention, reducing our dependency on cars severely reduces the negative impact on the environment and improves the public\u2019s mental wellbeing.\nInvesting instead in high-speed commuter rail to alleviate the congestion on the 401 for example would accomplish much more traffic reduction than removing any bike lane to add one lane for vehicles and is a very real option that the provincial government should be considering as a priority. There are so many people forced into cars on the 401 because it is currently the only option for a direct route despite the stress, danger and pollution in entails and giving the public a much safer, cleaner and relaxing option just makes sense. (By the way, as a fellow Bramptonian speaking from experience, I would very much recommend Minister Prabmeet Sarkaria try to instead take the Metrolinx train and TTC to get to Queen\u2019s Park for work as it is much more enjoyable and safe than taking the Gardiner).\nSpecifically in Toronto, the recent provincial government announcement to remove existing bike lanes on Bloor, Yonge and University is an EXTREME waste of taxpayer money on both the provincial and municipal level with these having been implemented within less than 5 years ago - undoing work that has just been done is a waste of taxpayer money that could be used in a crucially underfunded classroom or hospital.\nAll in all, I am requesting that the provincial government step out of municipal affairs by either dropping this Act or amending it to focus on duties the province should actually be responsible for, namely, working with municipalities by providing funding for public transit projects so that we can reduce congestion and our carbon footprint.\n"
