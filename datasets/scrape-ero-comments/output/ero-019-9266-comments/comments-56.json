        "comment": "I want it known that the total absence of any credible evaluation of any of the bike lanes installed on Bloor Street West in the City of Toronto is an outrageous abrogation of responsibility of Council.  Before approval of any bike lanes on any already-congested streets, responsible civic governance would have required a credible evaluation that includes:\n1) Traffic counts of bike lane usage at a minimum of a monthly resolution, since it is glaringly obvious to even a casual observer that the lanes are woefully underutilized at all times, including during the best weather and expected peak cycling periods.  The cycling usage data included to justify the expansion of bike lanes on congested streets to-date is incomplete and therefore inadequate.\n2) Permanent (prior to and after installation) ongoing analysis of major intersection congestion levels (see attached image file for an excellent example of a single visual representation of key data prepared by the City of Toronto for media distribution regarding our status as bottom-of-the-pile in North America for congestion levels in major cities).  How is it possible that this committee has not seen nor demanded an ongoing time series (quarterly/seasonal) of these maps to both assess the reasonableness of proposals that involve a worsening of congestion by design (such as bike lanes on congested streets)\n3) Net environmental impact of additional congestion (some details in the attached questionnaire).  Overall increased pollution levels from additional congestion should be obvious, but there are also local effects that impact pedestrians, and ironically, the cyclists using the lanes, who are stuck breathing additional noxious fumes from jammed traffic.  This impact is so blatant that a professional analysis is not required\u2014just ask any person who regularly walked (or ate in a sidewalk caf\u00e9) on these streets prior to and after the installations because they will be able to report directly from their nose and lungs.\n4) Analysis of any induced demand and mode switching of cycling trips prompted by the lanes.  A net impact analysis is required that demonstrates to what extent additional cycling usage is occurring versus simply diverting existing cycling trips from other pathways or accommodating cycling trips that are \u201cnot commuting\u201d (since a sufficient number of long, daily recurring, two-way \u201ccommuting\u201d trips would be the only possible rational for taking road traffic lanes out of service on what are already the most congested streets in the City).\n5) Impact of any traffic diversion onto local streets or other arterial roads due to the lane restrictions caused by the bike lanes.  Traffic doesn\u2019t simply disappear in the absence of good public transit options.  Only a tiny proportion of the general population is willing and able to commute by bicycle on any regular basis.  Therefore, traffic that was using the already-congested main streets spills into adjacent neighbourhoods, deteriorating their quality of life.\n6) Impact of increased pollution (emissions, noise) and congestion on the well-being of pedestrians and other users of main streets.  The slapdash design of the bike lanes, as proposed and implemented to date) are a gross embarrassment and appallingly bad urban design.  Aside from the visual clutter, they are dangerous for less-than-fully agile pedestrians who now have to deal with both cyclists whizzing by and vehicles traversing crosswalks while waiting to enter the main street because both views and access are now blocked by parked cars in the middle of the street as well as the bike lane hardware itself.\nThis is a brief list of issues\u2014there are many more, including the emergency vehicle and TTC shuttle bus issues.  Does any bike lanes evaluation (pilot or regular project) to date include even one of the 6 points listed?\nI fully support their removal.\nResident\nEtobicoke, Ontario\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes will do nothing to remove gridlock in Ontario, which is a function of a poor record on delivering transit that would remove those who do not need a car on a daily basis and allow those that do require one to move more freely. As one who uses my car 20x more than my bike, the bike lanes are welcome to provide safety and a set delineation for safe driving. For example, University Avenue's lanes were part of a process supported local hospital works, doctors and nurses, a group already under stress by the lack of funding to our public (not private, nor should it ever be) health system, who use it to get to the hospitals safely. AND, it should be noted these were put in place to allow for ambulance accommodation. It would be far more impactful to return to getting serious about poor driving skills across this province's populace. The only thing slowing down my neighbours are each other, while they run stop signs and red lights in residential neighbourhoods with schools.\nNothing about this process, online and in the broader media, being purported by this government provides evidenced based decision making, which tracks entirely with your premier's record during his time with the City of Toronto. It isn't even conservative in nature. Repeating meaningless catch phrases at podiums and spending more taxpayer dollars on PR is not actual responsible governance.\n"

The premier is welcome to run for mayor again if he's so inclined.\nRegardless, tearing up the bike lanes will cause more traffic than there already is, and the induced car traffic is only going to slow things down more.\nNot to mention the convenient construction contracts the government will likely hand out without any transparency or proper bidding. I wonder who will benefit from this.\nKeep your hands out of Toronto, and do something for the people.\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nAs a resident of Richmond Hill and a parent of young children, I'm writing to express my deep disappointment, frustration, and disgust with this legislation. This is a clear example of backwards, wrongheaded urban planning, and I'm very worried that it will take most of my life for future urban renewal projects to undo the damage that this will cause.\nI live in a beautiful neighbourhood, but the lack of bicycle infrastructure negatively impacts my life and the lives of my children on a daily basis. Despite being in easy cycling distance of wonderful parks, community centres, and other amenities, we find ourselves getting in the car for every trip that isn't in easy walking distance because of the lack of safe bicycle routes for us to use. Taking my children on the roads on their bicycles just isn't realistic with the high volume and speed of traffic that we encounter on our roads daily.\nThis means that almost every time I need to take my children to a local activity, we're using a car and contributing further to traffic congestion. I would much prefer to use our bicycles and avoid using the car as much as possible, doing my part to reduce traffic on our roads. I've spoken to other parents that have the same concerns, and I'm sure that there are hundreds of families all around us that want the same thing. In short, we want MORE bicycle infrastructure, not less!\nThis legislation may be trying to address the genuine issues of gridlock and road safety, but it's clear that the effect will be the exact opposite. By taking away people's ability to use other types of transportation such as bicycles, this government will force more people into cars and more cars onto the road. It will increase congestion and gridlock, promote road rage, and ultimately create less livable (and more dangerous) cities. Your constituents will not thank you for this, but will remember you as the architects of urban and suburban blight.\nIt's not too late to reverse this dangerous and shortsighted legislation. If enacted, this bill will end up damaging our communities in ways that may take the rest of my generation to undo. Simply by stopping this bill, you can promote the health and vibrancy of Ontario communities and push us further towards urban and suburban communities that we're happier to live in.\nPlease make the right choice.\n"

        "comment": "This is a purely political and emotional play that is a gargantuan waste of taxpayer money. Removing any physical transportation infrastructure is an ill conceived move that is not fiscally responsible and not supported by data.\nMunicipalities who are facing difficult financial challenges due in part to the downloading of services by a provincial government running a massive surplus have done cost benefit analysis and determined investments in bicycle infrastructure are more efficient at moving people in urban areas, make neighbourhoods safer for pedestrians, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and support a more healthy population.\nThis Government\u2019s own analysis clearly shows that removing bike lanes will not significantly improve traffic flows, and work done in Ontario and in other jurisdictions clearly shows that bike lanes improve traffic flow by taking cars off of the road.\nThis policy of infrastructure removal and wasting of public funds will not only not improve traffic, but will likely cause additional cyclist and pedestrian injuries and fatalities.\nTo get people moving in Ontario\u2019s urban areas this provincial government should focus on delivering its own over budget and delayed transportation infrastructure projects that have significantly increased traffic during their never ending construction, not tearing down those already completed by municipalities.\n"

Preventing the installation of new bike lanes is only a band-aid solution to the city\u2019s traffic problems. More people biking will actually reduce traffic. And the best way to encourage more people to bike is to make them feel safe while riding.\nUltimately, what it comes down to is the health and safety of cyclists vs a mild inconvenience for drivers. The ethical choice should be clear.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to the Ontario government\u2019s recent bill that would allow the province to ban and remove bike lanes.\nBike lanes are not a luxury, but a necessity for creating healthier communities, addressing climate change, and reducing congestion. Minister Prabmeet Sarkaria\u2019s claim that \u201cnot everybody can use a bike to get around\u201d ignores the crucial fact that not everyone can drive either. Young people (and those who otherwise do not have the ability to drive) deserve a safe method of getting around their communities. Bill 212 ignores their need for safe cycling infrastructure to be able to go about their daily lives.\nCars are an expensive privilege not everyone can afford. The government claims to be focused on reducing the cost of living for Ontarians, yet seems to believe that cars should be the primary method for people to get around. Focusing on cycling and transit infrastructure would show that you actually care about lowering the cost of living for your constituents. Removing bike lanes or stifling their implementation is a step in the wrong direction, for the cost of living crisis, Ontario\u2019s transportation network, and its environmental commitments.\nBike lanes reduce the number of cars on the road by encouraging people to use sustainable modes of transportation. They are vital for providing people with safe, practical alternatives to driving. Without these alternatives, we force more people into cars, leading to more congestion, more pollution, and a less healthy population. If the goal is to make cities \u201ca better place, an easier place to get around,\u201d as Minister Sarkaria suggests, removing bike lanes will do the exact opposite.\nCycling infrastructure is a cornerstone of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. At a time when we should be ramping up efforts to combat climate change, Ontario is instead considering policies that will encourage more driving and the destruction of green spaces, as seen with the exemption of Highway 413 from the Environmental Assessment Act. This is a direct attack on our environment and flies in the face of the urgent need to lower emissions.\nCities like Vancouver have demonstrated the immense success of bike lanes in reducing congestion, improving public health, and boosting local economies. Since the introduction of protected bike lanes on streets like Burrard and Dunsmuir, cycling trips have increased dramatically, with over 100,000 bike trips counted monthly at key intersections. These bike lanes have also contributed to a significant decrease in vehicle traffic and greenhouse gas emissions, while making the streets safer for all users, including pedestrians. Vancouver\u2019s investments in cycling infrastructure have not only helped the city meet its climate goals but also fostered a more vibrant, livable urban environment. This is a clear example of how expanding, rather than removing, bike lanes can bring positive outcomes to a city\u2019s transportation system.\nCycling infrastructure, particularly the implementation of protected bike lanes, plays a critical role in increasing road safety and reducing deaths for both cyclists and pedestrians. Studies have shown that streets with dedicated bike lanes experience significantly fewer traffic collisions, as they provide clear, separate spaces for cyclists, reducing the chance of accidents with motor vehicles. In cities where bike lanes have been introduced, such as New York and Vancouver, fatalities and serious injuries involving cyclists and pedestrians have dropped dramatically. By creating a safer environment for all road users, bike lanes help prevent tragedies on our streets and make our communities more walkable, accessible, and livable. Removing or restricting bike lanes would only reverse these safety gains, putting more lives at risk.\nI implore you to recognize that the path forward is not to dismantle our existing bike lane networks but to expand them. The future of Ontario\u2019s cities depends on fostering sustainable transportation options, and bike lanes are a key part of that future. The only solution to congestion is viable alternatives to driving, and bike lanes provide one of the most effective and proven alternatives.\nAs a result of this legislation I will be strongly advocating for my friends, family and community to not support the government in the upcoming election.\nI hope that the government will reconsider this legislation and instead advocate for policies that support active transportation, protect the environment, and create healthier, more livable communities.\nI wish to emphasize once again: The only solution to congestion is viable alternatives to driving. Removing bike lanes is an outright terrible idea that is bad for everyone.\n"

        "comment": "I live in downtown Toronto, near the Distillery District, and I fully support the proposed bill to better regulate bike lanes and address traffic congestion. This past weekend, during the Toronto Waterfront Marathon, road closures left me completely trapped in my block, making it impossible to access nearby hospitals by car. If I had needed medical assistance, I would have had no choice but to call an ambulance. This is an issue that highlights the need for better coordination between municipal projects and traffic management. Please consider expanding the proposal to include better planning for large events like marathons, ensuring that people have the right to move freely. Several individuals, including healthcare professionals, struggled to get to work or other appointments during the marathon, even though it was held on a Sunday.\nIn addition, the lack of enforcement for cyclists is a growing safety concern. As a pedestrian, I have had two near-collisions with cyclists who ignored red lights, and I have observed an increasing disregard for traffic rules. Any new bike lanes should be paired with stronger monitoring and enforcement to ensure the safety of pedestrians and drivers alike. I believe this proposal, by introducing stricter regulations for bike lane implementation, is a step in the right direction.\n"

        "comment": "This is a bad idea. It will not solve any problems, it will increase the size of government, reduce the independence of cities, make progress slower, and most important, it will lead to people dying without reducing commute time. It will also open up the ministers responsible for this legislation up for lawsuits as they will personally be signing the legislation to implement or remove bike lanes.\nBike lanes don't make congestion worse, the worst they do is irritate drivers because they see bikes sailing by while drivers are traffic, because remember, drivers are not stuck in traffic, they ARE traffic themselves. Today, while riding to work, I counted 15 bikes at an intersection downtown, condensed into two car-lengths worth of space - look at how efficient that is! It took some cars off the road - the bikers are the ones reducing traffic.\nRemoving bike lanes will also make Ontarians commutes worse - bikers are still going to be on those roads, with or without bike lanes, so now all we have done is make drivers angrier and cyclists less safe, while making doing the right thing harder because of government overreach. Do people in Queens Park really know what it is like to ride a bike in Kingston, ON, or Thunder Bay? Likely not. Let folks who are local to areas make decisions.\nThis legislation is a waste of time, a waste of energy, and will lead to people not coming home at the end of the day to see their families, but rather it will force their families to plan funerals.\nUnless the Ford government enjoys going to funerals, and being sued, I would suggest this legislation has no benefit to anyone. I will personally ensure that every cyclist who is killed because of a lack of bike lane will be known by the minister of transportation and the premier even after they have left office. I will ask their office every time if they plan to go to their funerals, and if they have sent flowers. That is all this legislation is doing, pushing us backwards.\n"

Where I live, in Kitchener-Waterloo, the municipal governments (Region of Waterloo, City of Kitchener, City of Waterloo) have made tremendous positive progress on making the cities more accessible by all modes of transportation.  A lot of research and pilot projects have been done over many years this bill will supercede all the hard work that has been done at the municipal level.\nIt just does not make sense. We need to think about moving people, not just moving motorized vehicles. This decision is tremendously short-sighted\nIn addition, this decision is dangerous to the most vulnerable road users, namely cyclists and pedestrians. Moving more cars faster is not the solution.

Bike lanes don't cause congestion, they help to alleviate it because they make it possible for more people to bike instead of driving.

It's also frustrating that the province is trying to micromanage municipalities. It only makes sense if the goal of this proposal is to win an election by using this issue to polarize and divide people.\n"
