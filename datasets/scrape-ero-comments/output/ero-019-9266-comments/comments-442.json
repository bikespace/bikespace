        "comment": "Please do not remove existing bike lane infrastructure! I rely on bike lanes to get to work and travel around the city safely. I do not feel safe biking on streets without bike lanes, because drivers are not looking for cyclists and I have had many close calls on roads without bike lanes. Bike lanes save lives!!! Also, I do not want to drive to work, because 1) it is too expensive to park, 2) it takes longer than biking and just as long as TTC, and 3) driving adds to the gridlock problem! Research and real-life data from around the road has shown that when there are safe alternatives like protected bike lanes, people will use them and this reduces traffic! We need MORE bike lanes, not less. Furthermore, removing existing bike lanes is not only irresponsible from a safety and public health perspective, but also from an economical perspective as this will cost tax payers even more money to remove what was just put in. Please don\u2019t do this. Please make Toronto a safer and healthier city by keeping and expanding existing bike lane infrastructure!\n"

I also see this as an overreach from the provincial government into municipal affairs.\nIf you want to ease traffic in the inner core, you have to add more advanced left turn signals and improve signalisation. Replacing bike lanes with traffic lanes will achieve absolutely nothing to reduce congestion.  Removing street parking would be a better way to add more car lanes.\nPlease update your files. This is 1950's thinking. Not looking good on the government.\nThank you.\n"

        "comment": "I have lived in Ontario my entire life and cannot support the decision to restrict and begin removing bike infrastructure in the province.\nI do not want the Provincial government dictating whether municipalities are able to evolve and expand their own transportation infrastructure. These are decisions that primarily affect the daily lives of the inhabitants of these cities and should be made by and for the benefit of those same people. It is not the place of the province to unilaterally block and further reverse or cancel existing infrastructure projects under the guise of \"saving us time\". All existing or in-development infrastructure represent decades of studies and the collective will of the populace to vote for and promote bike-friendly representatives and initiatives.\nAfter settling in Toronto about a decade ago I quickly found that cycling is the best way to get around. Taking the TTC can be effective but you often need to take an indirect route with multiple transfers to reach your destination. Driving (or being driven with the advent of Uber) has never in my ten years of living here been a decent viable method of getting around. The city is constantly beleaguered with construction, road closures, film shoots, you name it. So if I want to get somewhere, I take my bike. By taking away the bike lanes on Bloor, University and Yonge you will tangibly make my life and the lives of my friends and family more dangerous.\nMy father and both of my sisters have been in serious accidents on their bikes on residential roads in the small town of Niagara on the Lake. They were extremely lucky to not have been hurt worse or to have been on streets many times more dangerous such as those in Toronto. I am a very capable cyclist and as such I generally feel confident biking downtown, but that does not mean it is not dangerous. You must constantly be prepared for cars ahead of you to cut you off, people to door you as you pass, or pedestrians to simply step out in front of your bike without a glance.\nOne of the most significant changes I've seen in my time here, and one that has been most impactful to me, has been the addition of protected bike lanes. Especially those on Bloor and University that I use often. So much of the downtown core should be easily accessible by bike, and without the safety that this kind of infrastructure provides we will likely never see widespread adoption of cycling. Streets like Spadina or Dufferin with significant traffic but little to no protection for bikes regularly feel hostile on a level incomparable to other main arteries.\nThe added volume of food delivery and ride share companies has further strained this system, introducing frequent cyclist, e-bikers and scooters that now have to share space on all city streets. Having dedicated bike lanes helps to keep larger automobiles separate and reduce the risk of serious injury for the exposed riders.\nIn addition to biking I drive in the city on occasion, I also consider myself a capable driver and I'm not intimidated by the prospect of driving through even the most chaotic parts of downtown. However, as a driver I am equally grateful for the existence of divided bike lanes where I am never at risk of getting too close to a cyclist and putting them in danger. Furthermore, in some cases automobiles are also being protected from e-bikes or e-scooters which I find to be more erratic and unpredictable on the road than other vehicles. Having them in a dedicated lane keeps me safe from them suddenly entering or exiting the stream of traffic, as they often do.\nI do not want any money put towards contracts to rip out existing (and only recently completed) bike infrastructure. If anything we should be working to fix the gardener expressway and lakeshore being awful means to get in and out of the downtown core. I believe significantly more gridlock can be reduced by targeting these transition points between downtown streets and these highways like at Spadina where there are regularly multiple block backups leading onto the Gardener.\nIn summary, I believe the provincial government should not put itself in a position to deny critical infrastructure, endanger their citizens or interfere with plans conceived by the community over streets built for and maintained by the community.\n"

        "comment": "This legislation is baffling and dangerous. First, it's baffling legislation because it'll force cities to waste absurd amounts of money on tearing up bike lanes for no good reason, and because it'll add an extra, totally unnecessary layer of red tape. Secondly, it's dangerous because getting rid of these bike lanes WILL lead to cyclists being injured and killed unnecessarily, AND it will increase the number of car collisions both fatal and otherwise due to forcing more cyclists to drive.\nAnd the worst part? Schedule 2 of the bill, which both revokes the rights of Ontarians to challenge expropriation of their property if it's along the proposed route of highway 413, AND exempts it from environmental impact assessments. To be blunt, this part of the bill is madness. There's no good reason to be that cruel to people who own land along the proposed route of the highway, and exempting it from the environmental impact assessment could have potentially deadly consequences down the line by hiding potential dangers of the highway until it's too late.\n"

Sure, Doug Ford's alternative lifestyle choice prevents him from biking, but for the rest of us not in his slovenly special interest group, bike lanes provide essential infrastructure. Biking is good for kids, and busy families, and having bike lanes ensures safety and convenience. And when I'm driving, I sure as hell don't want to be dueling Uber-Eats drivers in my lane. I thought Doug was going to build up Ontario, not rip it up. When did the culture war become a conservative attack on public, safety, families, development, and efficiency? Is he going to attack sidewalks too?\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose Bill 212, as a Toronto resident who actively uses multiple modes of transportation, including driving, taking the TTC and GO Train, and biking.  This legislation undermines the progress we\u2019ve made toward creating a sustainable and equitable transportation system in our city.\nFirstly, the bill threatens to prioritize car-centric policies at the expense of public transit and active transportation. Toronto is already grappling with congestion and limited road space; further entrenching car dependency will only exacerbate these issues. We need to invest in and expand public transit services to meet the demands of our growing population, not hinder them.\nSecondly, biking is an essential component of our transportation landscape. The safety and accessibility of bike lanes have become crucial for encouraging more residents to choose biking over driving. Bill 212 risks rolling back the protections and infrastructure improvements that have been implemented, making cycling less safe and less appealing. This will ultimately deter people from biking, which goes against our collective goal of reducing traffic congestion and emissions.\nFinally, I believe that a truly effective transportation strategy must accommodate all users\u2014drivers, transit riders, and cyclists alike. Instead of moving backwards with legislation like Bill 212, we should be focusing on comprehensive, multi-modal solutions that enhance connectivity, improve safety, and foster a healthier environment.\nFor the sake of our city\u2019s future and the well-being of all its residents, I urge lawmakers to reconsider the implications of Bill 212 and to prioritize policies that promote a balanced and inclusive transportation system.\n"

        "comment": "I would like to comment on the government's removal of bike lanes in the City of Toronto. First of all, the provincial government should not be micromanaging municipal issues, such as bike lanes. Although I am a car user and do not commute by bike, I fully support the presence of bike lanes throughout Toronto, even on major roadways. Saving myself and other car commuters a few minutes of traffic is not worth the dangers of cycling through the city without dedicated lanes.\nI urge the government not to remove any existing bike lanes. Instead, they should invest the money in expanding bike lanes throughout the city and improving public transit, which would reduce reliance on cars as the primary mode of commuting. I strongly disagree with the government spending taxpayers' money to remove bike lanes that have already been installed.\n"

        "comment": "Toronto\u2019s east-west connectivity is as essential for cyclists as it is for drivers, making protected bike lanes on Bloor-Danforth crucial. Bloor Street\u2019s bike lanes form the only comprehensive east-west route for cyclists across the city's core, promoting sustainable, efficient transit options beyond driving\u2014a necessity if Toronto aims to be a forward-looking, livable city.\nOpposition to these bike lanes often claims they slow traffic. However, this argument overlooks several proven factors:\nTraffic Flow: Numerous studies from cities like New York, LA, San Francisco, and Paris show that adding more car lanes worsens congestion, as it attracts additional drivers who increase road demand. Conversely, protected bike lanes in these cities have been shown to improve overall flow by encouraging alternatives to driving, reducing car volume and congestion.\nStreet Design: Before bike lanes, Bloor did not consistently have two lanes per direction; it had more parking and one wider lane. More parking further discourages mass transportation options that Toronto is building and improving. Narrower lanes naturally and enhance driver focus, reducing accidents.\nSafety: Even if speeds are lower, slower car speeds make streets safer for all\u2014especially pedestrians. Bloor is not a highway; it\u2019s a central urban corridor surrounded by neighborhoods, schools, and small businesses.\nHaving lived in Bloor West for nearly three decades, I can say confidently that Bloor doesn\u2019t need more cars; it needs safe, inclusive transit options that help people move freely across the city. Removing these bike lanes would be a regressive step in urban planning, undoing vital progress toward a sustainable, accessible Toronto.\n"

        "comment": "The provincial government should not be encroaching on the jurisdiction of municipalities, especially to limit Ontarian\u2019s growing freedom of choice in the ways they travel. Bike lanes such as these, and all across the province, provide people safe and efficient ways to travel by bike. A proper society gives residents a reasonable choice of how they would like to travel and removing/limiting bike lanes is forcing more people into cars and increasing gridlock. Cars are one of the least efficient ways of moving mass amounts of people and many cities are realizing that there just isn\u2019t the geometry to move this many people if everyone is forced into cars. Maintaining bike lanes Is also much cheaper per capita than roads. We need bike lanes, consistent transit infrastructure, and safe walking options, more than we need more drivers on the road.\n"

        "comment": "The proposal does not seem to consider the reality that cycling is a quick, convenient and affordable means of transportation that is being adopted by more and more people in our cities everyday. In our city centres, and increasingly in suburbs as well, bicycles are just as important as cars for transportation. Therefore, space needs to be made for cyclists on our streets. Bike lanes not only provide a safer cycling route, but keep cyclists separate from the traffic, making it easier for drivers to navigate safely on the street.\nThe proposal also fails to consider that bicycles take up much less room than cars. Building good cycling infrastructure encourages more people to cycle, getting them out of cars and therefore using up less space on the roads.\nIt is well documented that having more lanes for cars does not reduce congestion in the long run, as these lanes quickly fill up with cars.\nFurthermore, I feel municipalities are better versed in the particularities of their traffic patterns and better able to consult with residents than the province is. We should leave it to Cities to decide how best to build transportation infrastructure.\n"

In particular take a look at the first case study, New York: New Bicycle Lanes, in which the data shows that adding bike lanes actually reduced car congestion.\nhttps://www.cbc.ca/news/science/bike-lanes-impacts-1.7358319\nFor a compilation and analysis of data on bike lanes and their impacts, please check out this article linked above.\nA quick summary of concerns:\n-\tInduced demand \u2013 build more lanes of traffic and people who were using alternate modes of transportation will choose to drive. More cars on the road = more congestion and time spent in gridlock.\n-\tAdditionally, removing bicycle lanes is a huge safety concern. Separate lanes for separate modes of traffic results in less collisions. As noted in the proposal details, \u201cThe Government of Ontario recognizes that accidents and lane closures can worsen traffic congestion and impact the quality of life of Ontarians.\u201d Removing bike lanes will result in more accidents (see first link) and thus will worsen traffic congestion.\n-\tIt is a misuse of money, time and resources to put in even more money, time and resources to remove bike lanes without substantial evidence of harm.\nWhen it comes to environmental impact, we know that cars are a problem. They produce smog, carbon monoxide and other toxins that are harmful to the environment and to human beings as we breathe in these toxins. This policy is prioritizing cars over other methods of transportation.\nThere is no requirement for data to justify maintaining or adding car infrastructure, however, this proposal requires municipalities to submit information about existing bike lanes in order to protect them.\nWe need policies that encourage and support environmentally friendly modes of transportation such as cycling, not policies such as this.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are an integral part of Toronto and the surrounding area for cyclists, as well as those who cannot drive possibly due to ineligibility for a license or financial restrictions. Cycling is also a great way to stay in shape while commuting around the city and with appropriate infrastructure can give you nearly as much freedom around the city as a car, potentially even more so! The removal of bike lanes will be a massive setback for the city, its residents, and will increase the dangers to cyclists and drivers alike.\nFor cyclists, there are two key reasons why bike lanes are crucial to Toronto:\n1. Safety - Biking in the road alongside cars is often dangerous, especially on busy roads. Cars are very large and heavy machines that can easily crush a pedestrian or cyclist. Bikes on sidewalks are also dangerous especially in Toronto. The sidewalks are often very busy and biking in between pedestrians could result in a collision. Unlike a car, people don't have turn signals or any warnings as to where they will move next. Isolated bike lanes provide cyclists with dedicated area to cycle and often have barriers to protect them from cars and traffic.\n2. Efficiency - Removing the bike lanes will not do anything to fix congestion in Toronto, instead the freed space will be taken up by more drivers choosing to take these streets. Now there are more cars but they are still just as congested. Bikes are very small and thus far more space efficient, increasing the density of people who can travel through these streets.\nI am all for reducing car congestion, but this is not the way to approach it. The Ontario government should disregard the removal of bike lanes altogether and focus on improving alternate transit infrastructure instead, a much more effective way of reducing congestion. This includes bike lanes, but also streetcars, buses, and trains. For example, the Toronto streetcars could benefit from replacing the switchpoints in the tracks, as they are very old and can only be traversed at very low speeds. GO Transit could also benefit from expedited progress on the electrification upgrades and increased frequency to allow for more ridership.\n"
