        "comment": "Thanks for this, I used it as a template and rewrote it as not to look like a copy-paste bot\n**Opposition to Ontario Bill 212: Prioritizing Safe and Sustainable Transportation**\nI am firmly opposed to Ontario Bill 212 (Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024) for several compelling reasons. This legislation\u2019s proposal to remove bike lanes as a strategy to alleviate traffic congestion is fundamentally misguided and lacks substantial evidence to support its effectiveness. Rather than easing congestion, this policy is likely to lead to adverse outcomes, compromising both public safety and sustainable urban development.\n**Historical Lessons: Removing Bike Lanes Does Not Ease Congestion**\nToronto\u2019s own history with similar measures demonstrates why this proposal is likely to fail. In 2011, bike lanes were removed from Jarvis Street with the aim of improving traffic flow; however, the city\u2019s own data subsequently revealed increased travel times and slower traffic\u2014precisely the opposite of what was intended. This precedent underscores the ineffectiveness of eliminating bike lanes as a means of reducing gridlock. Instead, it risks pushing more people toward car dependency, exacerbating congestion and increasing the strain on road infrastructure.\n**Public Health and Safety Risks**\nRemoving bike lanes endangers cyclists and other vulnerable road users. The absence of dedicated lanes for cyclists has been shown to increase accidents, injuries, and fatalities. These preventable incidents result in higher healthcare costs, emergency response expenses, and legal fees\u2014all of which ultimately burden taxpayers. Protecting bike lanes is not only a matter of safety but also an economically sound choice that reduces long-term public health expenditures.\n**Promoting Sustainable and Multimodal Transportation**\nSustainable urban planning should prioritize multimodal transportation solutions, encouraging walking, cycling, and public transit over car dependency. Bill 212 moves us further from these goals by diminishing the infrastructure for safe, sustainable travel options. As global cities increasingly adopt green policies and expand biking infrastructure, Ontario risks lagging behind, both in terms of environmental responsibility and in creating a livable, accessible city for all residents.\n**Alternative Investments for the Greater Good**\nRather than dismantling urban infrastructure, the province should direct resources toward initiatives that offer broad, lasting benefits. By investing in healthcare, education, and efficient public transit systems, Ontario can address core issues affecting residents\u2019 quality of life while also easing congestion more effectively. Such measures would serve the long-term interests of Ontarians far better than temporary, reactionary fixes aimed solely at accommodating suburban commuters and drivers.\n**Conclusion: A Step Backward for Ontario**\nBill 212 is ultimately a step backward for Ontario\u2019s cities and communities. Sustainable, inclusive urban planning calls for policies that prioritize safety, efficiency, and environmental stewardship. By preserving and expanding bike lanes, the government can foster a safer, more accessible cityscape that supports all modes of transport and contributes to a cleaner environment. Rather than catering solely to drivers, Ontario should adopt forward-thinking policies that build a resilient, inclusive future for all its residents.\n"

If anything, you should install more cycling lanes.\nToronto should become more urban by focussing on public transportation with subways, busses, and LRT. And providing safe cycling lanes as an alternative to driving a car.\nCars are an inefficient mode of transportation, whilst public transportation and cycling are not.\nI think that Torontonians will benefit from more safe cycling lanes (saving lives), parks (for relaxing), and less parking garages (urban eyesores).\n"

It is well studied that adding an extra lane to a road in a growing city does not improve traffic after people adjust to the existence of the new lane.\nThis bill will however add a huge amount of unneeded red tape for cities when creating bike infrastructure, as well as waste already-spent taxpayer money and make it much more dangerous to those who primarily commute via bike, such as my elderly mother.\nThere is no good reason to support this bill.\n"

        "comment": "Lots of cities have failed to learn from their past mistakes, but if this proposal goes through Toronto would be rather unique in straight-up incurring in intentional self-harm:\n1. It would lead to more road injuries and deaths ...this point should disqualify it right away\n2. It would substitute a mid-capacity infra (e g sidewalks, streetcars, bus/bike lanes) with a low-capacity one (motorways, parking spots, stroads), paradoxically leading to more traffic in the long run as fewer people have alternatives to car commutes, etc\n3. Making the combination of bikes + p.t. harder for users will further worsen traffic by pushing more people toward acquiring a motor vehicle\n4. It would lead to more red tape and bureaucracy\n5. Not everyone can drive and the more alternatives they get, the better quality of life and mobility independence for them\n"

        "comment": "This legislation is very misguided. Bicycle lanes are not a significant factor in motor vehicle congestion. The most significant factors are too many motor vehicles for the road capacity even without bicycle lanes, lack of realistic alternatives (transit, walking, etc), poor urban and municipal planning (residential and commercial and work areas are spread far apart making motor vehicle travel the only feasible option). This legislation is a political ploy to distract from the governments failure to plan and implement 15 min neighbourhoods where people can mostly walk or use public transit for most of their trips. As show in many news stories since this legislation was announced, there are many studies showing that bicycle lanes and grade separated cycle tracks actually dramatically increase the mobility of citizens and increase the commercial foot traffic for businesses along streets where bicycles lanes are installed.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes will result in an increase in cyclist deaths and will force cyclists to #takethelane in order to increase their own safety. This will only slow traffic again and cause even greater frustration for drivers and cyclists. Who will be the first to die on their bike and who will be the first to kill someone by accident in their car? A modern city includes robust and massively scalable cycling infrastructure - car lanes can\u2019t scale in the same way if you\u2019re concerned about city growth. Bike lanes need to stay. It\u2019s a solution that makes common sense.\n"

        "comment": "I am extremely disappointed to see this proposal from the Province. It is not based on an objective data that I can see, and is contrary to the results of the published literature. Inside city limits, the effects of vehicle volume, traffic lights, turning vehicles, etc, far outweigh the possible time savings that result from the return of a lane of traffic in a small number of places.\nIn addition, the presence of bike lanes facilitates a switch to cycling, where it is feasible. By getting more people to cycle in urban settings, the overall impact on traffic is positive. If there are hundreds to thousands of trips by bike on a bike lane, the effect on traffic of returning those people to their cars will be worse than in allocating space for bike lanes.\nIn my experience as a driver, most delays are as a result of traffic lights and the resulting backup of vehicles, or due to drivers' skill / knowledge, such as how to merge around construction or parked cars.\nHaving more bikes mixing with traffic will in fact slow down drivers, since cars will often need to slow down so they can wait for a safe opportunity to pass a cyclist. Having bikes and cars separated in 2 lanes improves the predictability of traffic and can help speed people to their destinations.\nFinally, Ontario is at a point of crisis for the health care system. Facilitating more active transportation has benefits for improving the health and fitness of Ontarians, which could help reduce the overall burden of chronic disease. Good quality, separated bike lanes also improve the safety of cyclists, which would also mean fewer acute injuries as a result of just trying to get to work or school.\nI urge the government to reconsider this proposal. Removing this infrastructure will be a costly mistake in terms of money and quality of life for Ontarians.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes will not improve the flow of traffic because people will be biking regardless of a designated bike lane but the difference will be putting cyclist in danger and inevitably slowing down traffic to share the road. With bike lines people can get to there destination safely and drivers won't have to worry. How can we justify taking a step back in our transportation infrastructure by even suggesting to remove designated bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "I am commenting as a resident along Bloor Street West, who walks, cycles and drives to get around. I cycle almost every day to work in the Bloor bike lanes. I am also a parent of two young children who both walk along Bloor and ride their bikes in the Bloor bike lane.\nThough I also drive a car to get around, I am concerned that the focus of this bill is to \u201cget drivers where they need to go faster\u201d. As a resident along the Bloor corridor, I am worried that the provincial government is forgetting about the people that live in these neighbourhoods and our safety. The number of pedestrian and cyclist fatalities in the city is frankly terrifying \u2013 and I can\u2019t imagine that a focus on speeding up cars along city streets is going to help.\nWhat I can say about my experience biking along this corridor is that I feel much safer. I have also witnessed an enormous increase in the number of residents and workers who are cycling \u2013 folks commuting to work, children getting to school and to after school activities, and delivery workers. Presumably many of these new riders are moving from cars to bikes which should help reduce traffic congestion. I can also say that having safe cycling routes has helped my family to avoid having a second car.\nIf the provincial government feels removal of bike lanes in the City of Toronto are truly an important provincial issue - I hope it will be collecting good data to assess whether or not the bike lanes in question are actually causing the issues it suspects, and assessing whether safer/less costly solutions are possible (such as adjusting signal times, or revising a few problematic intersections along the Bloor corridor).\nIf the data really does suggest that bike lanes are the problem, then I would implore you to first build safe, protected bike lanes on alternate routes before tearing out the current ones in order to keep residents \u2013 including our city\u2019s youngest ones - safe.\n"

        "comment": "As someone who has, in recent years, easily and happily navigated the streets of Toronto, Hamilton, and New York City on foot, bicycle, and with public transit, I cannot fathom the logic of this Framework. Favour motorized vehicles over bicycles? More space for cars equals improved traffic (and not, as has been proven, yet more cars)? Promote the option to release more carbon monoxide into our shared air and speed up climate change? Promote sitting in a car instead of the walking, peddling, and extra steps involved in transit use that is part of a healthful lifestyle \u2014which, by the way, saves our health system from dealing with all the ailments and diseases of a sedentary life. How sad and pathetic to propose the removal of bike lanes to help cars race more quickly around our city. Shame on the government of Ontario for even considering such a move back into the dark ages.\n"

        "comment": "The proposed removal of bike lanes on behalf of more car lanes will not ease the congestion. However, the bike lanes have the potential to relieve congestion by effectively reducing the number of cars.\nToronto is seeing a small cycling population due to a very limited cycling infrastructure. Measuring the effectiveness of bicycle lanes when the city has a few disconnected bicycle lanes is a totally unreasonable approach. For cycling to be an attractive alternative to driving, a continuous addition of safer bicycle lanes and a cohesive cycling network is required.\nThe effectiveness of bicycle lanes in easing traffic congestion can be seen in New York City. The city has been implementing bicycle lanes for nearly two decades. According to their report, the addition of the bicycle lanes reduced the vehicle travel time, demonstrating the positive effects of the bicycle lanes on traffic management. In addition, the bicycle lanes resulted in a decreased number of pedestrian/cyclist crashes and an increased retail sales along the streets with the protected bicycle lanes.\nFurthermore, the removal of the bicycle lane contradicts the proposal's purpose of relieving traffic congestion. Lewis-Mogridge Position and other related studies have proved that more car lanes will only induce more car traffic.\nHence, a wider implementation of the bicycle lanes is the key to solving traffic congestion.\n"

        "comment": "Eliminating bike lanes and cancelling planned bike lanes is a BAD idea.  For two big reasons.  First, because it puts the speed of automobiles above safety.  I\u2019m a cyclist, and I know how dangerous it is to ride on through routes without a bike lane.\nSecondly, because it disregards the priorities and plans of municipalities.  Let municipalities decide what is important to them!  My city of Hamilton has prioritized improving the bicycle transportation network.  Commuters, when they feel safer, are encouraged to try cycling.  It\u2019s not bicycles that cause traffic congestion; it\u2019s too many cars!\nPlease stop disregarding and contradicting our carefully managed city plans!\n"
