        "comment": "Not only is this proposal seem like a HUGE overreach for the province to attempt to police municipal roads, but it goes against all the transportation planning policy and goals of the Province and as a transportation engineering professional I am appalled. Earlier this year the Province\u2019s Bill 185 received Royal Assent which removed parking minimums in Protected Major Transit Station Areas. Furthermore, we\u2019re seeing municipalities aim to reduce automotive trips, including Toronto which have reduced most parking minimums. With reduced parking requirements throughout the Province, we should be investing in cycling infrastructure instead of wasting money to remove it or make it harder to implement. In the City of Toronto specifically, the goals outlined in TransformTO include all work and school trips < 5km to be via sustainable modes by 2030 and all trips < 5 km via sustainable modes by 2050. This proposal works against all of the policies the Province and municipalities are implementing and will frankly make the Province worse. Bike lanes are NOT the problem. Cycling is an important mode of transportation and part of the solution to solving grid lock in urban areas. You will NOT reduce traffic by removing the bike lanes you will just make it worse.\n"

Bike lanes promotes active transportation and converts short trips from car to cycling, which helps with gridlock.\nWe should promote bike lanes and speed up the process rather! This new legislation does not relieve gridlock. The province should put more energy on public transit and active transportation instead of encouraging cars that causes all the congestion and accidents\n"

        "comment": "This bill will achieve the exact opposite of its name. Removing bike lanes will only make gridlock worse. Traffic is to be solved by REMOVING cars off the road by providing other options such as reliable transit and safe access to bike lanes. Every study and scholar who has looked into this manner agrees. Additionally, the province should NOT be involved in small scale municipal issues like this. This should be left up to municipalities specifically to decide.\n"

        "comment": "number019-9266\nI am concerned that this bill makes it more difficult for municipalities to develop bike lanes. As I'm sure you know, biking is much more environmentally friendly than driving cars. Biking also reduces traffic, as it take more cars off the road.\nThe province should be doing everything in its power to reduce the number of vehicles on the road, and encouraging alternate means of transportation.  This would help ensure that people who absolutely must drive are spending less time idling thier cars in traffic. More bike lanes also means fewer overall cars, helping relieve our dependancy in fossil fuels which are heating up our planet at a frightening rate.\nIt's unfortunate that our province has been made so car dependant in the past few decades during a time when our climate is the most fragile its been in human history. But it's not too late to turn things around and make alternate modes of transportation easier to access.\nPlease consider the environmental, mental, and physical health implications of this bill. Nobody wins with this bill.\n"

        "comment": "The proposal to strip urban voters of more of their political rights by allowing the premier and his minister of transportation to decide where bike lanes are going to be placed, or have already been placed is a horrendous piece of public policy. It ignores climate science that the province needs to decarbonize, it ignores urban planning best practices where bike lanes provide economic, health and recreational benefits to local communities, and it treats the lives of pedestrians and cyclists as expendable so long as motorists are provided more lanes to occupy. Premier Ford, torontonians firmly rejected you as our mayor, and here you are, trying your damnedest to play the mayor that no one wanted.\n"

        "comment": "This bill does not appear to be evidence-based at all. Removing bike lanes that are already built is a waste of taxpayer dollars. Gridlock goes down when less people drive cars, which means that the best solution for gridlock is to make other modes of transportation viable and convenient. The Eglinton crosstown LRT and a toll free 407 would help gridlock, but the current provincial government has no political acumen to make those happen.\nTraffic should be slowed down because traffic accidents  kill far too many people in this province.\n"

You are just taking bikers out of the bike lanes and forcing them into cars to add to the traffic.\nYou could learn from looking at the actions of others major cities in Europe and North America. You don't see New York City or London trending in this direction.\nThis is not how our tax dollars should be spent.\n"

I use bike lanes, where they are available, to stay safe. It would be in nobody's interest for me to start driving to work. It is ridiculous to prioritize commute time in vehicles over the physical safety of cyclists. I vote, pay a lot of tax, and have the right to safely go to work. We need MORE bike lanes and accessible transit as alternatives to car-based congestion.\n"

        "comment": "The Ontario Government's proposal to impose provincial approval on municipal bike lanes is an absurd overreach and a blatant attempt to maintain car dominance at the expense of common sense. This policy, under the guise of \"fighting gridlock,\" is nothing more than a regressive, car-centric agenda that ignores the real needs of growing urban centers like Toronto.\nIn modern cities, cars are the problem, not the solution. Urban spaces are suffocating under the sheer volume of vehicles. Single-occupancy cars take up a ridiculous amount of space, sitting idle 95% of the time while clogging our streets the rest. And yet, instead of embracing the obvious need to shift away from this outdated model, this proposal doubles down on preserving the inefficient status quo.\nForcing municipalities to beg the province for permission to replace car lanes with bike lanes is not only bureaucratic nonsense\u2014it's an insult to the intelligence of local governments. Cities know their streets and their people far better than provincial politicians chasing votes in the suburbs. Bike lanes, public transit, and micromobility aren't optional luxuries\u2014they are essential tools to unclog city streets, improve safety, and allow people to get where they need to go without sitting in endless traffic.\nThe requirement to collect data and submit reports on existing bike lanes is nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt to slow down progress. This unnecessary red tape serves no purpose other than to obstruct municipalities from making decisions that are in the best interest of their residents. It\u2019s a clear case of the province trying to micromanage cities with no regard for the actual challenges they face.\nAnd let\u2019s not kid ourselves\u2014building more highways like Highway 413 isn\u2019t going to solve anything. It\u2019s just going to fuel more urban sprawl, more congestion, and more dependency on cars. The only people who benefit from this policy are the car manufacturers and developers who profit from endless road expansion. The rest of us are left with gridlocked streets, pollution, and a city that\u2019s becoming increasingly impossible to navigate.\nThis proposal isn\u2019t just out of touch\u2014it\u2019s a dangerous step backward. If Ontario is serious about addressing gridlock, the province should be encouraging more bike lanes, not throwing obstacles in their way. This kind of regressive thinking has no place in a modern city that wants to move forward, not remain stuck in traffic.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is, in short, utterly nonsensical. It fails to take into account the simplest axiom of traffic planning: traffic is fundamentally a problem of too many cars.\nIn order to improve gridlock in the city, driving needs to be discouraged, and other, more efficient modes of transportation need to be encouraged. Putting further obstacles in the way of dedicated bicycle lanes has the entirely opposite effect, further contributing to the problem. In addition, this worsens the quality of life for drivers and cyclists alike, as the lack of separation between them results in an increased frequency of conflicts, collisions and injuries.\nWhy take aim at bike lanes when an even more space-inefficient road feature that serves even fewer people exists in the form of street parking? A sensible legislation would instead review the necessity of that along major roadways, since it always results in the removal of a full car lane and also proves to increase cyclist/driver conflicts by obstructing sight lines and restricting turning lanes at intersections. It makes no sense to set aside valuable road space on major arteries for cars that aren't moving at all.\nI urge this office to consider these factors and prevent this shortsighted measure from passing.\n"

This is massive government overreach and overstepping from a government that claims to be about \"small government\".\nResearch induced demand before moving back to more car lanes. Please read Walkable Cities. If you remove active transport, all those people taking up very little space will be in cars, taking up a lot of space and not reducing traffic in the slightest. We need to move away from car centric culture into walkable communities, with biking paths and good transit. There is physically a limit to how many car lanes we can have in communities, so we need to push alternative methods, including cycling.\nAlso, cyclists are hit by cars regularly in Toronto. This is so unsafe. This is a liability to lawsuits from cyclists being hit because their bikelane was removed.\nHonestly, this might be the most ridiculous proposal I've ever heard.\n"

        "comment": "I am an urban planner and municipal lawyer who works and lives in Toronto. I regularly interact with both city and provincial policy frameworks and administrative branches in my daily work. I have great respect for both local and provincial autonomy and authority. Also, I generally align with the Conservative Party and own an SUV which I drive often enough.\nThat all said: the issue of bike lanes in any municipality should be controlled by the governing local government, period. Interjection of provincial authority on what is entirely a local issue is completely unfounded. Stay out of local decision making. The PC\u2019s should be the party of small government, not governmental overreach.\nI happened to have written my Masters thesis up at York University on the history of urban development and transportation infrastructure in the GTA. That was 20 years ago and traffic on the Allan was brutal even back then.\nBottom line:  study after study has shown bike lanes do not increase traffic. What they do is increase bicycle ridership, which the city desperately needs, along with a massive focus on public transit. More cars on more roads is not the solution to an epidemic.\nSo rather than impose arbitrary control over an issue that we have elected local officials to act on, perhaps the province could instead consider a congestion tax for the drivers entering urban centers at no cost? That approach would actually reduce traffic, as opposed to just blaming bike lanes because you see them next to you!\nPlease, do better!! Our cities need cycling infrastructure to thrive. Look at every significant leading city and you will see how Toronto leaves behind all of: Tokyo, London, Paris, New York, etc. Our cycling infrastructure is still embarrassing in comparison, so the attempt to obstruct future improvements is borderline criminal\n"
