If you are lucky enough not to have to rely on them, you are not in a position to be making decisions about our city. Leave it to the City of Toronto to make informed decisions. See you in the protests if this moves forward. Shame on you, \u201cSaving You Time\u201d????? You will spend the next 3 years defending this heinous decision. We refuse to let this government continue to destroy and gut our city. Cycling is good for health, business development around the cycling lanes, happiness, reducing gridlock, and the evolution of our city.\n"

        "comment": "This is a ridiculous, short-sighted, and spiteful policy.\nThere is not a single data point to validate claims that bike lanes are the root cause of traffic or gridlock in Toronto. Bikes lanes reduce the number of vehicles on the street, provide people with more viable options to travel, and ensure those who decide to bike are protected from automobiles. They ensure that both cyclists and drivers alike get where they need to go safely.\nRemoving protected bike lanes will not reduce traffic. Some cyclists will stop riding their bikes and get into cars, which will only further contribute to automobile gridlock. Others will now be forced to bike in the middle of the road. How many cyclists need to be maimed or killed before we realize this is not the way forward?\nMontreal, New York City, Amsterdam, London, Copenhagen - there is no shortage of incredible \"world class\" cities that have robust, interconnected bike lane systems. Why then are we reducing Toronto to a car park? More bike lanes and more mass transit solutions are the key to reducing traffic; removing or defunding either will only make traffic worse.\nDoug Ford is once again dreaming up of cynical policies to spite Toronto at the expense of the Ontario taxpayer. Citizens of North Bay, Ottawa, Orillia, etc. will be on the hook to help pay for Doug's dream of making Toronto worse. This is little more than a distraction from the Ontario government's failure to complete the Eglinton LRT, and to signal to suburban Ontario drivers that he will cater to their feelings, rather than recognize any sort of study when it comes to urban planning.\n"

        "comment": "I do not support this new policy!  Building more highways and adding more vehicle lanes only invites more traffic and causes further congestion.  Cities need to provide alternative transportation options such as bike and transit lanes to get people out of cars and reduce congestion.\nFurthermore, the province should not be adding additional process and red tape around how cities manage their streets.  This is an outrageous policy to require provincial approval that will have serious repercussions for climate action and the transition to low carbon transportation needed in this province!!!!\nI seriously hope you reconsider this terrible idea.\nLaura\n"

        "comment": "Cummer to Leslie is our main route to North York General Hospital, and was a common route ambulances took to take us back from both NYGH and Sunnybrook due to congestion on Bayview and Leslie. Now it is one narrow lane with little cycle traffic, but many cars hitting the curbs and drifting into the opposing lane. In winter, a slip will lead to a head on collision, and almost everytime we drive there there is an issue turning onto the section or congestion...there is no room for an ambulance to service an accident there and the turning lanes were also removed. It is grossly negligent to put such a danger in the area, add congestion and have the entire section of town blocked when a bus has an issue or any emergency occurs there. Those who planned it should be named as many law suits will result from this poor and dangerous planning. They should be fired.\n"

        "comment": "As someone who bikes in downtown Toronto as a way to get to places easily and especially where the subway is not as convenient or accessible, I\u2019m disappointed to see this. The bike lanes are meant to encourage ease of access to downtown dwellers that don\u2019t need to buy and use cars to get around. Removing je bike lanes is disincentivizing downtown dwellers from biking around and instead encouraging more car usage, which would in turn increase car traffic. Not to mention the safety issues for bikers would increase without these key bike lanes. I do not approve of this policy.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes do not cause congestion, and they provide safer travel options for both drivers AND cyclists by reducing opportunities for crashes. Also the volume of cyclists has increased since installation of these major bike lanes, particularly on Bloor and University, which not only reduces car traffic by encouraging another alternative/safe commute option, but it also reduces congestion during rush hour on lines 1&2 of the TTC.\nIn addition to the congestion, the bike lanes have been shown to increase customers and overall business in the Bloor Street area (supporting document/report attached), and have therefore provided a massive benefit to local businesses in the area. Not only would removing the lanes reduce that positive growth, but the construction required to remove the lanes and turn them back into regular car lanes would cause much more congestion than we currently have. This needs to be considered and factored into whatever planning happens - removing the lanes WILL cause additional construction delays, at a time when many of our other streets are crumbling and require improvements, and the resources would be better used improving and maintaining our other roads; not ripping up something that works.\nRemoving these lanes is a terrible idea and use of public funds when so much work has already been done to install them. If a change needs to be made, we should be removing on-street parking on these major arterial roads, so that all traffic (whether pedestrian, vehicle, or bike) can continue moving in the space that is available. On street parking takes up the most space for the lowest benefit to the greater public and commuters who use the area.\n"

        "comment": "As someone who does not bike or drive, but lives downtown near both Bloor and Yonge Street, (living on Bay and Wellesley), I would much rather keep the bike lanes than the traffic lanes. Changing social culture is important for environment and sustainability, and we need to prioritize the social culture that values this. If traffic has worsened because of bike lanes, drivers should be making the switch to bikes. They are much cheaper and have a significantly lower carbon footprint. Removing the bike lanes is the opposite of progressive, and pandering to those who are stubborn about change will not get us anywhere further.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is deeply concerning. We should be discouraging drivers to take their cars to downtown, and instead, make the streets safer for pedestrians and cyclists. I used to commute on foot on Spadina in downtown for years and thought the sidewalks are too narrow and the bike lanes aren\u2019t safe enough for cyclists. There have been too many accidents and a lot of people are getting killed by reckless drivers already. Build the city safe for people not the cars. And this is also environmentally unfriendly not to mention.\n"

Your bill will do the opposite of its title! Look at any existing research on city planning, transportation and bike lanes to learn this.\nI'm appalled.

        "comment": "I am incredibly frustrated by this proposal which will not only introduce more red tape to city management from the province, but is completely counter to evidence and the well being of city residents.\nIt is a huge waste of tax-payer money to remove bike lanes that were just put in, and to create a process for the province to review every instance of municipalities wanting bike lanes. I would prefer that the province spend their time and resources on things that actually matter at the provincial level, like healthcare and increasing housing. City planning should be left to the city.\nRemoving bike lanes creates a less safe environment for cyclists who would then have to bike on the street and be closer and less visible to cars. I'm also less comfortable driving when there is no dedicated bike lane.\nAdditionally encouraging people to use other forms of transportation besides driving is not only good for the environment, but also reduces vehicle traffic on the road as people are diverted away from using cars. If the province actually wants to reduce traffic, they should invest more in public transit and alternate routes of transportation which are much more efficient at moving people than single-person vehicles.\nResearch has also shown that adding additional lanes does not improve traffic in the long run, as people will just change their behaviours to take that route and use their personal vehicle when they otherwise wouldn't. Additionally, the outermost lane of traffic downtown is often blocked by one or two parked cars anyways, so removing a bike lane wouldn't even open up that route.\nI'm also incredibly frustrated at the mentions of removing bike lanes specifically on Bloor, Yonge and University, as it sounds like the premier's personal vendetta against bike lanes on his route to work rather than an actual justifiable reason for removing these.\nOverall, PLEASE make this decision based on actual evidence so you don't waste time and money on making our cities objectively worse and less safe.\n"

        "comment": "As someone who used to live in Toronto for school and was a frequent user of both the bike share program and the Bloor bike lanes, this bill is ridiculous and depicts absolute mismanagement of those who govern in their understanding of what ACTUALLY causes congestion.\nBike lanes do not cause congestion. Cars cause congestion. Bike lanes give people a safe and comfortable alternative to get out of their car which in turn, reduces the number of cars on the road. If you have 100 bikes on a bike lane per day, that's 100 cars off the road.\nAdding vehicle lanes of traffic does not reduce congestion - rather it creates MORE congestion. This government doesn't seem to understand the meaning of \"induced demand.\" The more vehicle lanes there are, the more it appeals to people to choose cars.\nRecently, I was in Toronto with my mom. Someone who hates biking and drives everywhere. We spent a lot of time on Bloor. The one thing she came away with from that trip? That a lot of people were using the bike lane and that she never once saw vehicle congestion on the road.\nYou're not going to take cyclists off the road by removing the bike lanes. Now, they're just going to ride with traffic, making it more unsafe for them, and creating even more congestion for the vehicles you're trying to \"help\" so much.\nSure, put in a bill to review plans that remove a vehicle lane of travel. But do not remove bike lanes already in place. Continue to invest in sustainable modes of transportation.\n"

We are living in a time of seeing the deleterious impact of climate change, and I am fortunate to be able to cycle to work thanks to bike lanes.This proposal will lead to more cyclist injuries and deaths; we have had 6 cyclist deaths in Toronto in 2024, which is an increase in cyclist deaths from 2023 (where there was one). The removal of protected bike lanes will contribute to increased deaths. Without bike lanes, I would not feel safe sharing the road with cars. This is a shortsighted and dangerous policy that will lead to more injuries and deaths. Finally, the province should not play a role in determining whether the City of Toronto's bike lanes should continue to exist or not.\n"

We need to start respecting all road users, bikes, pedestrian,  cars...we are all in it together. The province should be sending this message over and over again. Increase fines for people who break rules. Adding bikes lanes and taking away other transportation only creates animosity.\nAnd Doug's message fuels the animosity.\nBike lanes are all in the gutter where debris and snow get piled up. We don't ride bikes are year. Bike lanes should be shared with cars and car drivers need to respect other users and not be so single minded with their needs.\nSo, the government needs to start posting adds about compromise,  and patience.\nThis goes for all drivers and riders in the city.\nLeave the bike lanes until there is a clear plan and start changing the attitudes of the way we move around the city.\n"

It can be quite a drive, especially if there is an accident on the QEW or on Cawthra.  We have seen bad accidents at both locations since September, one with a med-evac with a helicopter coming down beside our car on Cawthra near Qew.  .  I do care about saving time, but even more important to me is reducing deaths on the road which bike lanes do, and, reducing the devastating impacts of climate change by Reducing our C02 emissions.  It\u2019s worth taking the extra time,   Also, I like that traffic has slowed down a touch in our neighbourhood with the bike lanes.  It has made road crossing safer for children and the elderly and reduced the incidence of speeding which has traditionally been a huge problem.  Thank you, Maeve Sullivan\n"
