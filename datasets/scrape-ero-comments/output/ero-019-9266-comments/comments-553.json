        "comment": "As a Toronto resident who cannot drive due to a disability, the provincial government has not made transit accessible or safe. Instead, we have culture war crusades against bike lanes, that make pedestrians and bikers feel like second class citizens and that our safety does not matter.\nI urge the provincial government to reconsider Bill 212.\nOntarians have known for decades that increasing car lanes both on and off highways is not a sustainable solution for people driving cars. I\u2019ve even heard people suggest that sidewalks took up too much space between roads and buildings, which is quite frankly, insulting to people in Ontario who walk, use mobility devices, push strollers with children, walk their dogs, among other activities that we should be considered when discussing bike and car lane infrastructure.\nThis also sets a bad precedent for the rest of Ontario. Smaller cities and towns who benefit from bike lanes that currently exist or who are considering them in the future to alleviate traffic. With this bill, they will no longer have that opportunity.\nBike lanes help keep up safer by ensuring there\u2019s designated space for people to cycle. Clearly, man drivers are hostile towards cyclists. How is forcing them back parallel to car lanes any safer?\nEnough is enough.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose Bill 212 to remove some existing bike lanes and slow down the progress of creating a well thought out bicycle network around the City of Toronto.\nOn a daily basis I make a decision which transportation method to use, whether to walk, bike, drive or take transit. Unfortunately, taking public transit specifically street cars in down town is often just a bit faster than walking. Therefore, if you need to get somewhere reasonably fast you can only consider to bike or to drive. Wherever there is a safe bike lane I cycle and where there isn't one I have no choice but to drive.\nBy removing bike lanes there will only be one transportation option: to drive. Forcing everyone to drive will quickly choke up the city with impermeable grid lock where everyone is  stuck in cars with no other alternative.\nThis is the situation now, but it's reasonable to expect the population density doubling and even tripling in the near future at least in down town. Therefore not surprising that almost every other major city around the world is relying on cycling as one of the major modes of transportation.\nIn conclusion, cycling is a fast, reliable, cheap, and, healthy method of getting around the city while using only about a 1 meter wide lane.\n"

        "comment": "The proposal to remove bike lanes is pretty backwards. If you want political points, talk about how you'll improve education, healthcare, affordability. Transit via personal vehicle is a fools errand because the moment you make more people drive, it'll just go right back to being a clogged mess. All it takes is one guy turning left in front of a streetcar. How about banning left turns. That's another inane suggestion you could implement.\nAt least the do-nothing mayor had tried to put up posters for vision zero, what you'll be doing here is vision let-them-die. Kids bike in these streets, bike lane or not sometimes. What you'd be advocating for is more dead kids. No 2 ways about this.\nUltimately, I don't think what you're trying to do is really about bike lanes... it all detracts from the message around removing environmental assessments. If it comes to bulldozers on Toronto streets, well... we'll know you weren't meant to be our mayor.\n"

        "comment": "This is so irresponsible.  Such a waste of money to do harm to our cities.\nFirst off, stay in your lane!  Let cities decide for themselves what they need.  Don't sit in Queens Park and pretend you know our neighbourhoods better than we do.\nSecondly, you are completely missing the way to reduce traffic.  As cities get bigger there will never be enough room to fit everyone in their own car.  Imagine what would happen to downtown Toronto if you removed the subway and put everyone in a car.   Traffic happens when there isn't enough space.  But cars are the least efficient form of transit for a tight space.  You can fit way more pedestrians, transit riders, and yes, cyclists in the same space as you need for one car.  You need to give people alternatives to cars that work.  Then it will work better for everyone including those people who choose to drive.\nBike infrastructure might not get used much until you connect enough of it to get people from A to Z.  If you have gaps, of course people can't ride it!  You need to fill the gaps.  Judging existing bike lanes as \"mostly empty\" would be like counting how many cars cross a partly open draw bridge!  The three offending bike lanes in Toronto are the start of a network.  Something that is gradually being built.  It takes time.  You don't get milk from half a cow.  Finish the network, then see how many people ride it.\nPlease don't ruin other cities because you don't like the traffic in yours.  And please don't waste money removing good infrastructure.  It will be so sad to me when someone is killed as a result of this.  I'm definitely going to chip in to the lawsuit to sue the government when that happens.\n"

        "comment": "As a regular cyclist, I use my bike to get to downtown for chores, to do my groceries and to stay fit. The solution to the traffic problems in Toronto downtown is not removing bike lanes en masse, but to have constructive discussion with stakeholders who live in that area. The Bloor and University bike lanes serve as arterial safe paths for a lot of people to get to work, for chores, and act as a safe path for tourists who roam around the area on cycle rentals. If these major bike lanes are removed, it would greatly increase the risk of cycle related accidents and cyclists having to choose to ride bikes on footpaths for safety. Please reconsider this bill and open it for discussion.\n"

        "comment": "I am not happy with the changes proposed in this bill. I rely on bike lanes to get across the city. It is already difficult having to pick one of the few routes with protected lanes to get to specific areas, but ripping out brand new lanes that see a lot of use from healthcare workers and office commuters will add more congestion, increase traffic, and encourage more folks to drive or hail rides, which will result in gridlock. That's without mentioning the millions of dollars of tax money that would be wasted on such an effort.\n"

        "comment": "This bill aims to \u201cmove drivers faster.\u201d The province should be concerned with moving people faster, however they choose to travel, and wherever they choose to travel to. A policy that prioritizes drivers at the expense of other options is exclusionary, unjust, and dismisses all the evidence of how to move people efficiently and effectively.\nThe province has assumed that new highways or wider highways will reduce congestion. Has more lanes on the 401 led to less congestion? By entrenching driving as the only option, we will inherently get more driving.\nAs someone who lives in London, I have very limited choices other than driving to get to other cities. The province should be spending its transportation dollars on expanding and improving those choices rather than bankrolling a new highway that will achieve the same result: congestion.\nAnd I consider myself lucky that I can afford to own and operate a vehicle and be of a certain age and ability to drive it. Many can\u2019t drive for various reasons and the options they have to move around this province are slow, expensive, and undignified.\nWhich brings me to most of my travel which is within the city. My main mode of travel is by bike as it is for my wife and children. We enjoy being outdoors, getting exercise, and experiencing our surroundings while travelling. We drive for certain trips and we take the bus every so often, but biking is our main squeeze.\nIn many ways we feel spoiled to have cycling as part of our lives. It\u2019s not a chore or a hassle. For the majority of the time it\u2019s much more pleasant than driving.\nSo I disagree with the entire thrust of this Bill. We need more options in how we move around not less. We need to make options that are not driving more attractive not less.\nThank you for considering my thoughts. I long for a City, a province, and a country that everyone can move around easily, to the places they want to go, whether by bus, train, car, bike or on foot.\n"

        "comment": "My wife uses the bike lanes on Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue to get to class at the University of Toronto and I use these bike lanes to get to work. In the evenings, we use these bike lanes together to get groceries, go to the gym and visit friends. Like many bicyclists, my wife is ONLY comfortable biking in the protected bike lanes like the ones on Bloor, Yonge, and University. If these bike lanes were removed, we would be forced into alternative modes of transportation that are very expensive in comparison. We would have to purchase a car and pay at least another $350 per month for parking and insurance, or $284.15 per month for monthly TTC passes ($156.00/month for me and $128.15/month for my wife). Right now, we are paying $8.75 per month for the annual Bike Share pass. We are already struggling to pay rent each month and this change would reduce our quality of life.\nPlease halt the removal of the the Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue bike lanes!\n"

Removing sections of the Bloor bike lane threatens to make this commute significantly more dangerous. Every morning and evening this bike lane is absolutely full of cycle commuters. Where will they go? Back to overcrowded subways? Back to cars adding to the gridlock? Or back to endangering their own lives riding in shared lanes?

I see zero pertinent data about the three bikes lanes you propose to remove. Furthermore it is not the job of the Premier to make decisions about municipal infrastructure. And at no time have I seen any reference to the safety of cyclists. I have only seen comments about the flow of motor vehicles. I have seen nothing to justify the claim that traffic will flow better with bikes mixed in with vehicles.

In addition to this, having safe bike infrastructure will enable toronto to reach its vision zero goals faster by creating safe spaces for ALL road users. The removal of these newly installed bike lanes such as the one on University street  is something that I do not want my tax dollars going towards. Given the levels of road congestion in Toronto nowadays, i have only witnessed more individuals using our bike infrastructure. It was be a shame for it to be torn up in favour for car lanes that are far less efficient and encourage a less green mode of travel.\n"
