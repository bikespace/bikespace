I thought it is important to prioritize one's health, many students and civilians use the bike lanes from going to point A to point B without spending money on gas or transit fare. It's a way of saving money, and others use it to exercise in betterment of wellbeing. Additionally, constructions that takes up all, three, or two lanes causes more traffic. Back to back constructions from connected routes and workers who spend more time taking a break while people are getting late for work and classes. That causes traffic.\n"

The fact that a provincial legislature is targeting a specific city as part of their legislation screams of authoritarianism -- let the cities build what the residents of the cities want!\nWe, the residents of Ontario, want everyone to be able to get to where they are going safely! Without a shadow of doubt, driving a car is the most dangerous activity that most of us will ever perform in our lifetimes. How much death and destruction are you willing to enable at the behest of the fossil fuel industry.\nAlso, I implore the ministers in this government to think critically. If the tens of thousands of trips made by bike are now made by single-occupancy cars, what do you think will happen?\nI can guarantee you that adding tens of thousands of single-occupancy car trips within the city will NOT relieve congestion. It will do exactly the opposite.\nI love my bike ride every day! It is fast, convenient, clean, and safe! Not to mention the human connection and interaction I get when saying hello to families and other commuters on the path. This is what a good commute looks like. We need more of it, not less.\nPlease listen to the public and think critically. This bill is the antithesis of common sense. It is an authoritarian-style power grab that will put many many Ontarian lives in danger, while also making car traffic worse.\n"

As a politician who has campaigned tirelessly both on City Council and as Premier to reduce waste in government spending, I am shocked that you would waste millions of dollars to rip up work that has taken months and years to plan and build. These local planning decisions have not been made hastily - they have been made after a significant period of assessment and many consultations considering all points of view. Local businesses have endured the disruption of construction while changes were being made. Do not force them to endure more disruptions by ripping out the work that was just implemented. This is completely counterproductive and the very kind of wasteful decision that you have so strongly criticized. Respect the democratic process and local jurisdiction. If there are concerns from a provincial level, work in partnership with the municipality to address them.\nI want my Premier to be a bold, forward-thinking leader, that is willing to stand by decisions that create healthier, safer communities with cleaner air, and take our responsibility seriously to future generations to reduce emissions. There will always be resistance to change, but with the right incentives of an excellent bicycle infrastructure, efficient transit that is well connected throughout the city and GTA, we can build communities and a province that attract people and business from around the world. Look at the world's leading cities and regions and what they are doing - biking infrastructure has done wonders and reduced congestion in their downtown cores. That is the way of the future, not building more highways or preserving a concrete jungle. Be bold Premier Ford, and be the leader future generations will look back proudly on.\n"

I thought we have a goal in reducing the use of gas and oil and other things that affects climate change? I thought the betterment of the environment is important?\nIf so, why are you removing bike lanes? They are important use for people saving money, exercising, and participating and helping to prevent the further worsening climate change! If the bike lanes are returned to motor vehicles, that means inviting more people to use their own instead of public transit. It means, constructions can take more time because there's additional lane. It means, unsafe for people trying to walk safely, and vechile motors are everywhere speeding and crowding together. There are highways and expressway for a reason. Now, roads and city roads are not simple for motor vehicles only.\nIf you don't like the look for third world countries. The look and pain of traffic from overcrowding cars. The look and pain from accidents and accidents. The look and pain from jaywalking, because motor vehicles are prioritized and it means more time to wait for crossing pedestrians. If you don't want that, don't remove bike lanes.

I rely on the bike lines to get me to and from safely. Before the bike lanes there were times when I questioned if my decision to bike would be at the risk of my life and being there for my family. For some this has been true. People should have the choice of biking, for their health, environment, and as a way to reduce congestion, and they should be able to make that choice safely.\n"

        "comment": "I disapprove of the Ontario Governments overreach into Municipal affairs that will waste tax payers money and reduce the safety of many residents who prefer alternative modes of transportation. I disapprove of the removal of bicycle infrastructure and disapprove that their removal will be exempt from environmental assessments. This Act (and act) is more about appealing to voters that drive automobiles into major cities from outlying areas of suburban sprawl than it is about improving the mobility of people in cities. If the Government was serious about improving the mobility of people in high population regions there would be large scale investments into public transit that would reduce the source of congestion on roads and highways, automobiles.\nThe Government of Ontario's claim that automobile traffic congestion is caused by the inclusion of bicycle infrastructure is flawed.\n1) Transportation Minister stated in reference to Toronto, \"We know that these bike lanes, where only 1.2 per cent of people use to commute to get to work, are taking away almost 50 per cent of the infrastructure on those streets from vehicles\"\nFirst, the statement is disingenuous. Bicycle lanes are not solely used by commuters, they are used by all types of bicycle users. Moreover, the 1.2 per cent figure was obtained from a 2011 census prior to the installation of any meaningful bicycle infrastructure. Those surveyed included regions as far north as Lake Simcoe, east to Ajax and West to Burlington. As a citizen who has bicycled in those areas, I deem it unsafe for bicycle use and am not surprised by low bicycle trips of any kind. A majority of bicycle infrastructure in Toronto was constructed between 2016 and 2021. A 2019 study of Torontonians (not surrounding area) found that 70% of respondents use a bicycle for some function whether commuting, recreational, or other travelling needs. The same 2019 study found the number of bicycle users in Toronto has been steadily increasing and that people are more likely to bicycle when infrastructure permits them to do so safely.\n2011 Census\nhttps://www12.statcan.gc.ca/nhs-enm/2011/as-sa/99-012-x/2011003/tbl/tbl\u2026\n2019 City of Toronto Cycling Study\nhttps://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/8f76-2019-Cycling-Pub\u2026\n2) Argument put forth by current Government of Ontario: more automobile lanes will reduce traffic congestion.\nAll traffic flow studies indicate the addition of lanes provides only temporary relief to traffic congestion on the timescale of 2-5 years. The added lane invites more single occupant automobiles and the inevitable congestion that was present before the lane was added. It is the principle of induced demand. Even the Governments own research shows that the addition of Highway 413 will have no net benefit on traffic flow by 2041. Research shows that the only solution to traffic congestion is to reduce the number of automobiles by providing other means of transport on major roads that connect all public infrastructure users to the places they are travelling. Automobile centric designs will only add to congestion, not relieve it.\nHighway 413, no net benefit by 2041\nhttps://www.thetrillium.ca/news/municipalities-transit-and-infrastructu\u2026\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposal to remove existing bike lanes in Toronto. As a daily commuter who travels with my young daughter on my bike, I can personally attest to the safety and security that these bike lanes provide. They are essential for protecting cyclists, reducing traffic congestion, and promoting a greener, more sustainable mode of transportation.\nBike lanes are not only a safer alternative for cyclists but also help to alleviate the city\u2019s traffic issues by offering a viable option to car travel. Removing these lanes would not only endanger cyclists but also contribute to increased traffic and pollution, making our city less livable for everyone.\nFurthermore, the management of bike lanes should remain under the jurisdiction of the City of Toronto, which understands the unique needs and challenges of its residents. The provincial government should focus on enhancing public transit and car-sharing programs to make them more appealing to drivers, rather than dismantling infrastructure that benefits cyclists and the broader community.\nI am deeply disappointed in the Ford government\u2019s proposal, as it undermines the safety and well-being of all road users. I urge you to reconsider this decision and prioritize initiatives that support sustainable and safe transportation options for everyone.\n"

Traffic was terrible, transit was spotty and biking was dangerous. 15 years later street cars are more reliable along King and I haven\u2019t swerved to miss a car door more than a handful of times.\nI can easily afford a car but I don\u2019t have one because I can safely bike. I don\u2019t contribute to parade of cars chugging along major and side streets. Getting rid of bike lanes means we all share the road. Drivers don\u2019t want to share the road, they don\u2019t want cyclists at all so unless you\u2019re planning to ban bikes, this doesn\u2019t accomplish any real goal.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 will not reduce gridlock or save time for the people of Ontario. Due to the concept of induced demand, building more lanes of traffic will make traffic worse in the long run. This is a concept that has been proven and understood for decades. This bill is not based in scientific research or the interest of the public, and as a scientist I am appalled. Bill 212 also goes against the stated principles of the Ontario PC Party. In the PC Party Constitution, it is stated that \"we accept our responsibilities... for the conservation and renewal of our environment for the present and future generations\". This bill promotes a car-centric transportation system which does not help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\nThe only thing that reduces car traffic is providing viable alternatives to driving. Some examples are fast and convenient public transit options, mixed-use zoning to create walkable neighbourhoods, and save bike infrastructure. Calling Bill 212 the Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act is at best misinformed and at worse actively deceitful. I expect my government to do better.\nAs a resident of Ontario, I don't like to drive. I would prefer to take public transportation, walk, and cycle. I longboard, and when I have safe bike lanes that are separated from car traffic, I am more likely to skate instead of walk or drive. When I am driving, I feel much safer when cyclists are separated from car traffic so I don't have to worry about hitting them. Separated bike lanes make our cities safer for everyone. I also believe that municipalities should be able to build bike lanes that remove lanes of traffic. I don't think that the Provincial Government should control municipal transit and walkability projects.\nPlease don't pass this bill. It will make Toronto streets more dangerous for cyclists and for me.\n"

How does removing and preventing lanes help grid lock when it means that anyone who uses bikes, e-bikes, e-scooters, etc will now just be sharing the same lanes as regular vehicles? How does having a car that is able to go 50Km stuck behind a cyclist who may not be able to reach those speeds prevent grid lock? Would this not simply introduce more gridlock and issues? If you want to reduce gridlock then investing into good and reliable public transportation is the best way: incentivize people to not be driving individual vehicle but instead use a bus or car pool. 1 person = 1 car vs 2 people = 1 car sure seems like that means there would only be half the current amount of cars on the road, greatly reducing congestion.\n"
