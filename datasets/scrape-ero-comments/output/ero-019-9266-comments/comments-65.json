        "comment": "So, you're coming up with a process to determin what lanes will be removed. This process does not exist yet, but at least 3 toronto bike lanes will for-sure be removed regardless of what process you come up with, or what the data on congestion you do not have yet shows?\nWhy both with collecting data and making regulations around bike lanes at all? Couldn't you just arbitrarily demand the city remove any lanes you don't like instead of wasting all this time and effort to reach a goal that's already determined?\n"

The construction to remove them will be its own source of congestion for years too, at the rate this city builds things.\nWhy does the premier of our province only seem to care what happens in Toronto?\n"

        "comment": "This proposal seems like a massive step backwards and a huge barrier to progress in building safer streets with more options for travel. The newer bike lanes have been fantastic for improving biking in the city. Adding more overhead to constructing these lanes and reviewing/removing them would be a massive waste of government resources.\nKeep the bike lanes, don't introduce overhead from the provincial government, build more protected bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "As a transportation professional in Ontario, specifically one that's working in active transportation I want to underscore the disdain and anger from people in our profession. There was NO consultation with the Ontario Traffic Council, ITE, and other transportation professionals who work to design and construct these bike lanes. Companies and municipalities across the province use a variety of transportation modelling tools such as VISSIM and Synchro to collect data on delay times and LOS of intersections (clearly things the government knows nothing about). This legislation is a direct attack on the engineers and planners who have studied and worked in the field for years by creating an additional level of red tape and stress to a very precarious position. Colleagues working in municipalities that are trying to build new bike lanes using data and fact-based approaches are often verbally assaulted due to the misinformation being spread by this government. Instead of listening to professionals, it is truly unclear who this government is getting their policy from.\n"

        "comment": "The Premier's focus on fiscal irresponsibility directed towards Toronto is ridiculous. My municipal tax dollars should not be spent both installing bike lanes only for provincial tax dollars to override the city's planning processes. The municipal government has a much better understanding of how to improve gridlock by reducing the number of vehicle trips in city roads by encouraging other methods of transportation across within the city. The provincial government should stick provincial and interregional transportation rather than trying to govern the city.\n"

While I have a car, my primary mode of transportation and commuting is by biking (especially with the proximity of the Bloor bike lanes and University to go into the financial district). Removing these bike lanes will mean that I will have to use my car more often, which will lead to more traffic. I also strongly disagree with using taxpayer money on removing infrastructure when we have such significant deficits in healthcare.\n"

In the absence of bike lanes, cyclists will not get off the road -- they will ride in the lanes with the cars, making the road less safe and increasing congestion. Whatever you are planning for future bike lanes, leave the existing bike lanes alone.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes is idiocy. They do not contribute to traffic congestion. If anything, they remove it by getting people out of cars. Maybe look at improving transit infrastructure so that people have an alternative to driving.\nAlso I thought Doug Ford and his Progressive Conservative (An oxymoron if I have ever heard one) Party of Ontario was meant to be the party that was cutting \"red tape\" instead they are creating more of it?\nHonestly, cars aren't the solution in the city, we have so much construction, too many drivers which leads to gridlock and frustration, removing bike lanes won't change that. Maybe try having the police actually do something and direct traffic at intersections so that people don't block them.\n"

Bike lanes are good for business. They\u2019re good for the environment. They\u2019re good for public and personal health. They give us freedom and mobility. Bike lanes save lives.\n"

        "comment": "I am devastated that our politicians don't care about cyclist safety, as someone who has been seriously injured by a careless driver. I always wear my helmet, use several lights at nighttime, ride at a reasonable pace, always sober and aware, obey the rules of the road, never ride on the side walk, and I stick to bike lanes or quiet streets. I do my part to keep myself and those around me safe, yet Ford is manufacturing a culture war at my expense. I was harassed several weeks ago at night by a group of men, simply for riding my bike home, minding my own business. I can't afford a cab, do not feel safe waking alone at night as a woman, and unfortunately the city's public transit isn't a safe alternative anymore. What are my options? I pay taxes, I follow the laws and rules of the road. Why doesn't the province care about my ability to safety move around my own city? I can barely afford rent and groceries in this economy, how am I going to afford a car? I feel hopeless. It's unbelievable that you want to waste tax dollars ripping infrastructure out when our healthcare system is crumbling. There is no evidence supporting this approach. Please invest in our safety and wellbeing. I beg you.\n"

It will just make it more dangerous for them to do so and we already have more deaths in the city than should be allowable.\nRemoving bike lanes just mean cyclists will take up a vehicle lane and slow traffic more than if they have their own designated area. It also benefits drivers in that they don\u2019t have to worry about cyclists swerving in and out of traffic.\nWe need bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "Reducing gridlock by increasing red tape?\nCitizens elect mayors and city councillors to represent their local interests. In cities like Toronto, we've elected people who support the expansion of bike lanes and bike routes as a solution to gridlock, because many people who vote support those ideas as well. In addition to helping with gridlock (since bikes take up much, much less space than cars), bike lanes also help with pollution and climate change (reducing emissions from cars), and they make it safer to cycle for people of all ages, including those who can't drive, like children and students.\nStudy after study confirms that building more road capacity for cars does not solve traffic \u2014 it merely increases the number of cars on the road. Meanwhile, there is plenty of evidence that bike lanes in Toronto improve life for businesses as well as cyclists. Driving in Toronto is infuriating, but the solution is more and better transit service, and easier and safer access to alternative modes of transportation including cycling.\nThis legislation is an undemocratic overreach, putting the concerns of the few (wealthier car owners in certain parts of Toronto like Etobicoke) over the needs of the many (people of all ages who rely on transit, cycling and walking to get around), and it introduces unnecessary red tape and interference into what is clearly a municipal-level government concern. Let the citizens of each city decide how they want to run their cities through the normal democratic process.\n"

If you are so concerned about traffic flow, you should remove on-street parking from main roads, thereby freeing up an entire lane in each direction. People will die if these bike lanes get removed and the conservative government will be responsible,\n"
