        "comment": "I do not believe that the existing bike lanes along Bloor St., Yonge St., and University Ave. should be removed. They provide vital infrastructure for bikers in downtown Toronto. Removal of bike lanes would result in greater accidents for those who continue to bike. Many bikers would also be forced to stopped biking if the infrastructure is removed. This would result in greater use of the already limited transit system, and greater congestion on roads. Bike lanes are much more efficient at moving people than cars on roads. Bikes take up much less space than cars, and most cars only hold 1 or 2 people in them anyways. Most people in downtown Toronto do not even own a car, but they have easy access to biking through the Toronto Bike Share program. Countless studies have shown that adding lanes to roads does not reduce congestion; it would not save commuters any time. We need more efficient modes of transportation. Biking is one of them. We need more biking infrastructure in downtown Toronto, not less. The bike lanes on Bloor St., Yonge St., and University Ave. are especially important as these roads connect many different parts of downtown Toronto.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes for cars is not going to solve traffic. Bikes already have barely any space compared to car space, and bike lanes move so many more people compared to a congested road. If Ford hates how bikes pass him as he sits in his car in traffic, he should realize that he isn't just in traffic, he is the traffic. Take away bike lanes and you get fewer people on bikes and more people in cars, increasing traffic. Having a city built for cars is a mess, let those who don't want to deal with that bike in peace.\n"

Continued efforts in building bike friendly neighborhoods will provide safer transportation for vulnerable individuals like the elderly and children. Building bike infrastructure on main throughways helps more people move around in a smaller area and helps push towards climate goals. When riding alongside cars they regularly endanger my wellbeing, even though I'm a good cyclist, all it takes is a bad or impatient driver to change my life.\n"

        "comment": "While the intent of removing gridlock is laudable, the mechanism for doing so by requiring provincial approval for bike lanes that remove a traffic lane is misguided and will be counter-productive in several ways.\nEncouraging car drivers to switch to riding bicycles removes cars from the road. This in itself reduces gridlock. In addition, bicycle riders and others who are physically active are healthier and this reduce costs for our health care system.\nOn the flip side - removing bicycle lanes discourages physical activity and causes more bicycle-car accidents, which results in more hospitalizations and costs for our health care system.\nIt is a well-established fact that having separated bicycle lanes (which often requires removal or narrowing of existing car lanes) encourages people to ride bicycles. People ride when they feel safe and don't ride when they don't feel safe.\nRequiring a provincial review of each municipal decision for a bicycle lane increases government red tape and will result in cumbersome, time-consuming processes. This goes against a stated goal of the Provincial Government of reducing red-tape and improving government efficiency.\nRemoving bicycle lanes also hinders local businesses. Bicycle riders and pedestrians are much more likely to frequent and support local businesses than cut-through automobile traffic. Support for local small businesses is a stated goal of the Provincial Government and it is difficult to reconcile this with the removal of bicycle lanes.\nAir quality will also suffer in cities. Every new car added to the roads increases the air quality problem. Every car removed from the road and every bicycle added decreases the air quality problem.\nHeavy vehicles, including cars, cause more wear and tear on roads than bicycles. Shifting road usage toward cycling can significantly reduce the need for expensive road maintenance over time. Bike lanes typically require less maintenance, which can help cities allocate funds more effectively.\nFinally, the removal of bicycle lanes will not solve the gridlock problem. There was gridlock before bicycle lanes were introduced. Going back to an old problem without any attempt at addressing the traffic problems with new ideas and new solutions is not really doing anything at all. It will just emphasize that the Provincial Government is bereft of ideas and solutions.\n"

Biking is the most efficient and economical way for myself and other downtown nursing students to avoid paying expensive car parking rates. I consider bike lanes an essential part of transportation infrastructure like roads and sidewalks. It's safer for cyclists to be separated from cars, especially on a busy street like Bloor. Thank you for considering the diverse safety needs of people getting around in Toronto.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is a bad idea. Cycling infrastructure, especially for Bloor, Yonge, and University, is built to protect cyclists where cars have killed them. The need for this infrastructure is written in blood and calculated in peoples' lives.\nCycling infrastructure increases freedom of mobility, especially for people who can't afford or can't drive a car. They decrease congestion by providing an alternative to adding another car to the roads.\nBenefits of cycling infrastructure aside, this bill infringes on the jurisdiction of municipalities. How can the province claim to know better than the municipality when it comes to the needs and wants of their residents? The addendum is especially bad when the province will require the City of Toronto to remove existing (and especially nice) cycling infrastructure on the three most used and key routes.\nPlease rescind this bill, or at least the addendum that would remove routes!\n"

        "comment": "My family uses the bike lanes in Toronto every weekday. We don't own a car and I don't know how to drive. Instead, we have a bicycle and a bicycle trailer that we use to take our 2-year-old daughter to preschool. For the first part of the trip, we bicycle through the back streets. But the one way system means that we can't legally cycle the entire way through the back streets. We rely on having good separated bike lanes on Bloor so that we can travel safely with our toddler.\nThese bike lanes are not just convenient, they are essential for us. Our little girl is in a trailer that's relatively low to the ground, and an inattentive driver could easily run into her. We have a flag on the trailer and a light, but I know that we wouldn't feel safe riding with her in fast mixed traffic.\nThe bike lanes on Bloor in the West end have not only made it safer to bicycle. My partner tells me that it is now easier to drive on Bloor near Royal York. He grew up in that neighborhood and we frequently visit his parents there. He remembers that the constantly switching lanes (from parking on the right to turning on the left) between Royal York and Prince Edward were very frustrating to drive. But now that stretch is faster and easier to drive because the lanes do not change, and the cyclists are given a safe place to be and are thus also less distracting for the drivers.\nBicycle lanes benefit all road users. They protect cyclists' lives, they make things simpler and easier for drivers, and they protect pedestrians by discouraging any riding of bicycles on the sidewalk.\nI have been cycling on roads in Toronto for 34 years - from when I was 13. When I was younger I didn't have any sense of my own mortality and would happily ride in traffic with great big trucks going by. But now that I have a child, I am so aware of how dangerous large vehicles can be to very small vehicles. Cycling is it important way for many people to get around the city, and the more people who use bicycles, the less car traffic drivers have to deal with. But we cyclists should be in a separate lane of traffic because we are not as fast and we are not as large as motorized vehicles. Giving us all our space on the road makes everyone safer and gets everyone where they are going faster.\n"

        "comment": "It's nonsense to put cyclists in danger in a city where people drive looking at their phones, change lanes without looking or signaling and overall have a poor sense of judgement. I drive through the city and removing bike lanes will just have the same outcome for me which is bumper to bumper traffic. It's a huge waste of finances and resources to add an additional lane which people will be sitting in regardless. Cyclists already have little or no options to transit across the city safely.\n"

But there is huge proof of downsides if someone cares about the lives of bikers and the environment.\nAlso, building highways should be subject to environmental review.\nThis is bad legislation that is frankly anti-democratic as it is reversing decisions that have already been made at the local level for local residents. Maybe 1% of people in Toronto are bikers, but bike lanes probably do in fact take up only 1% of the roads of in Toronto. Where there are bike lanes 10-20% of locals use bike lanes. It is healthier for the people, and the environment.\n"

Since this bike lane has been completed I use it several times a day, and it is extremely well-designed, much like the bloor street bike lane.\nCycling in Toronto is just beginning to become feasible, and removing these bike lanes will send us back years of development. Car traffic will certainly not be fixed by the removal of these bike lanes. Toronto needs to strongly consider the future generations in which cars become less and less feasible as the main mode of transportation.\n"

All for what??? To provide drivers with a slightly faster commute time? Risking the lives of bike riders for to save the precious car drivers a few minutes on their commute? Please dont be ridiculous.\nIf the bike lanes are ripped up there is no way i am biking around the city. I do not want to be killed by a careless driver. So what does that mean? It means Im taking my car, which has now added to the traffic. An absolute lose-lose situation for everyone involved, that has cost the taxpayers millions.\nThis is so ridiculous and so silly i sincerely hope this is a joke. Anything for the precious car drivers, oh what a marginalized and inconvenienced group!!! Please grow up.\n"

        "comment": "I'm a 15-year-old living in midtown Toronto (North York). Most of the time, my parents are busy with work and other commitments, leaving me to get around the city for my various needs, such as getting to school, work, extracurriculars, and friends' houses.\nI've been taking the TTC and biking around Toronto, from uptown to downtown, from Scarborough to Mississauga, and everything in between. For many trips, even long-distance ones, my bike has been a huge help to get me places on time. The safe bike lanes around the city, such as on Yonge, Bloor, portions of Eglinton, and even bicycle \"gutters\" (paint infrastructure) such as the short segments on York Mills or Bayview have been a huge contributor to making me feel safe from quickly moving motor vehicles.\nI'm wondering how the provincial government can indirectly tell me that my safety as a commuter without a car is unimportant (especially as a teenager, it should be of utmost importance to keep me and my fellow commuters safe). It seems inappropriate to rip out bike lanes for the benefit of drivers even though cyclists and other commuters also deserve to have transportation options which suit them.\nToronto is a city with a growing cycling network, and as the city becomes increasingly interconnected with bike lanes, this network will continue to thrive.\nI've attached a study below, in the \"supporting links\" section. The study researched the correlation between providing alternate transit modes (such as public transit, walking, and cycling infrastructure) and relieving overall congestion. By providing commuters with options which best suit them, other than just the car, commuters can opt for different transit modes (which in more cases than not is a bike or public transit), and cars will be taken off roads, relieving congestion.\nEven when I have my driver's license in the future, I will continue to cycle around the city as it's a climate-friendly and healthy way to commute.\nPlease take this into consideration - bike lanes have offered me, a teenager, a safe and fast option to get around countless times, and I'd love for them to continue doing that in the future.\n"

        "comment": "Why is there even a need for the province to be involved in a municipal decision? Bike lanes are essential travel infrastructure. I use them on a daily basis and local governments need to be free to make these decisions based on the needs of their communities without excessive bureaucracy slowing down or reversing the process.\nAlso, removing bike lanes from streets will not solve traffic. More lanes for cars will not solve traffic. It's induced demand. (Link 2, also discusses issues with highway 413). As there are more lanes, more people will drive, causing the same slow travel speeds as before. Making it more attractive to bike will make more people choose to switch from driving to biking as it becomes faster and more comfortable than driving.\nFurther, what about safety? Protected bike lanes make it much safer for cyclists AND makes it much less stressful to drive. From personal experience as someone who bikes and drives, I always prefer streets with separated bicycle infrastructure no matter if I'm driving or biking. Having separated spaces for different modes of transport makes both modes better. Many studies have also found that protected bike lanes are provably safer. Reference link 1 compiled a number of studies analyzing the safety of bike infrastructure, all of which confirm that protected infrastructure reduces the risk of injuries and deaths in cyclists.\nIn all, removing bike lanes and preventing new ones from being built will result in disadvantaging those that cannot or choose not to drive, likely make traffic worse, and continue to put cyclists in harms way. This bill is a bad idea.\n"
