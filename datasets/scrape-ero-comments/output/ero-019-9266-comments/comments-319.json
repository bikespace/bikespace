        "comment": "I think this is a short sighted, and dangerous move for the provincial government to make.  In a confrontation between a cyclist and a vehicle, the cyclist always looses.  We should be encouraging people to take other forms of movement around the city, and if in the process it slows things down a bit, then we are all safer.  I have spoken to many people who prefer to drive than take public transit because of reliability, safety, and coverage.  But what options do people who do not own a car have?  Would government money not be better spent in increasing transit options than tearing up bike lanes?  If you force those cyclists back on the roadway, all it takes is one driver with no respect for a person on a bike, and who wants to go a few mph faster than the speed limit for an accident to happen.  In most European cities people that live in the city core use bicycles, and people coming in from the environs take transit.  I live close to the downtown core, and am part of a two vehicle household, so I do see both sides of the argument.  I think there is more that the city can do to reduce congestion, and that removing bike lanes is like taking a chainsaw to trim a leaf off of a tree.  It\u2019s overkill, and one small slip could damage the tree irreparably.\n"

Construction is the biggest cause of traffic throughout the city, especially along Bloor. Removing the bike lanes involves more construction and delays along with spending more budget which could be better used elsewhere. Think longer term and bigger picture than this.\n"

        "comment": "As a resident of Toronto who actively uses these bike lanes, I cannot overstate how strongly I oppose Bill 212.\nPersonally, I have two young daughters under the age of 4 and use these bike lanes almost every day to transport my children around our wonderful city. Contrary to Premier Ford's belief, bike lanes improve traffic flow by offering safer options for transportation that encourage a large portion of the public to bike instead of drive, thus removing more vehicles from the road. Bike lanes are better for the environment for the same reason. Bike lanes also help small businesses grow and thrive, since it's much easier to simply hop off your bicycle and lock up than it is to find a parking spot.\nBut above all, bike lanes save lives. I find it telling that Premier Ford would rather waste taxpayers' money on removing critical transportation infrastructure that is already built, instead of improving infrastructure for northern and rural communities, building sustainable, affordable housing, or even providing much-needed relief in the form of adequate funding for our healthcare system that is near collapse.\nThis bill is frankly an insulting overreach of provincial jurisdiction. Premier Ford and the provincial government should focus their efforts (and spending of taxpayer dollars) on more pressing matters that actually affect the entire province.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes in urban areas like downtown Toronto on Bloor is probably one of the most unhelpful and nonsensical solutions to solving congested traffic issues. Just think about it for more than 5 seconds:\n1) bicycles are significantly smaller than one single car. Did you know that means more people can fit on the road per bike vs per car? That implies more people can travel more efficiently, which means less traffic.\n2) more moving cars on the road also reduces safety for literally everyone on the roads, including drivers. Fun fact: that means more vehicle accidents, which means more car-related injuries which require more need for emergency vehicles to respond, and guess what all that comes with? More traffic congestion.\n3) removing a bike lane also removes a lane that can be more easily used by emergency vehicles navigating urban streets. What's easier to move for a massive firetruck? Several active cyclists that are already aware they're biking beside a road, or a 5000+ lb SUVs stuck in traffic? It's not a trick question.\n4) increasing traffic for \"more efficiency\" in daily commuting never works. That just invites more traffic and doesn't solve anything. You know what else it does though? Increases traffic\n5) no one likes to mention the environment anymore but it's still a thing so please never disregard it. The only time (non-motorized) bikes produce greenhouse gas emissions is when the bike is actually being made. You know when cars emit GHGs? When they're made AND everytime the damn thing needs to move.\nPlease do not take this comment as a personal attack, I am just very frustrated with this style of urban planning and I'm tired of cities designed for cars instead of the people actually living in it. I've lived in the GTA for 28 years and I know Toronto and the rest of Canada can be better than this. Increasing more traffic is never sustainable for anyone, let alone the environment. Give people the option to travel within the city how they want, whether it's by bike or car. Giving them the proper space to do so safely should be the ultimate goal of urban planning.\n"

        "comment": "Robust evidence from cities around the world and the city of Toronto\u2019s own data shows that these bike lanes do not legations impact automobile traffic - in fact these bike lanes actually reduce congestion (and air pollution) by replacing thousands of daily car trips. At the same time, removing the bike lanes will make the street more dangerous for everyone - including people in cars. Again, the data are clear: as the number of cyclists goes down, the risk of serious iniury and death goes up. This change will not reduce congestion, but it will cause more preventable injuries and deaths on Toronto streets.\n"

We need to be forward looking and support individual wrll-being (physical and mental health) and climate risks/environmental sustainability efforts by encouraging people to cycle as a form of commute!

This is a baseless overreach into the city's oversight of its own infrastructure.\nPeople want more transportation options, not fewer. People want a cleaner, greener city. A healthier city. More space for cars on the road means more cars on the road, which causes more congestion.\nThis is not about reducing gridlock! This is jurisdictional overreach, putting the lives of all road users and especially cyclists at risk and imposing into Toronto's affairs. Safety and quality of life are the cost of this political folly.\nOver 6 cyclists have already been killed in Toronto this year. Removing and limiting bike lanes in Toronto may be to blame for any more, if bike lanes are removed.\nBike lanes save lives, are good for businesses, health, and safety. They provide freedom and mobility to so many people who choose not to or cannot drive.\nThe government is crushing that freedom and safety and progress in this bill.\n"

        "comment": "Quite a lot of research has been done in this area and it shows exactly the opposite of what you are saying: protected bike lanes promote cycling, providing an alternate means of travel, thereby reducing gridlock. Additionally, businesses benefit more from pedestrian and cycle traffic than from cars on the street -- studies find that segregated bike lanes increase commercial activity. This has been demonstrated many times over, all over the world. All of the folks who specialize in these areas, be it city planning, civil engineering, or economics, all draw their conclusions from data: bike lanes are good for traffic and good for businesses.\nAs a consequence which I have not seen you talk about, countries and states that invest more in public cycling infrastructure see immense economic savings on healthcare expenditures, because folks are able to engage in regular exercise in ways that are part of their day to day. Surely for a fiscally conservative government this is a benefit.\nSee these high level summaries:\nhttps://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2019/4/18/mr-go\nhttps://rapidtransition.org/stories/reducing-roads-can-cause-traffic-to\u2026\n"

They encourage active transportation and ensure that drivers and cyclists can share roadways in clearly defined ways.\nThe bike lane on Bloor Street, in particular, has long been a cherished dream of the cycling community - and once the period of construction and initial adjustment is behind us, I believe there's every reason to hope it will be broadly received as a landmark of a healthy, modern, climate-aware city.\nWe don't need to get mired in unhelpful rhetoric that pits drivers, cyclists, pedestrians, and transit users against each other. Many people use all four of these modes of transportation to get around, and we should be able to do it in the confidence that our safety and dignity are well supported at every level of government.\nWith urgency, I'm asking you to respect local decision making, and not undo the recent progress in making Toronto a bikeable city.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are essential infrastructure: reject Bill 212!\nI understand that Bill 212 would prohibit new bike lanes if they would require removing automobile lanes. Worse, Ontario could review\u2014and perhaps remove\u2014existing bike lanes. Indeed, Premier Ford has been clear that the result of Bill 212 would be that the province will force Toronto to remove the Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue bike lanes. This is profoundly concerning to me. My family and I rely on bike lanes for safe, efficient transportation everyday. For us, bike lanes are essential infrastructure.\nWe live near Bloor West. Several new developments representing thousands of units are being built around us right now. This is a necessary response to the housing crisis. But, the neighborhood cannot sustain thousands more cars, no matter how many lanes of motor traffic are opened on Bloor. The future of our neighborhood cannot rely on automobiles for transportation. We would strangle ourselves in congestion. Bike lanes\u2014which support bicycles, e-bikes, mobility scooters, and more\u2014are a flexible alternative that keep people moving.\nWithout bike lanes, essential thoroughfares--which even non-motorists must use--can be treacherous for anyone not in a car. I have been hit. My wife has been hit. My biggest fear is that my children will be hit. I do not want to raise my children in that environment. The success of existing bike lanes shows I don\u2019t have to.\nBike lanes allow us to navigate a busy urban environment where cars have a place too. Disallowing or removing bike lanes would unnecessarily endanger me and my children, and for what? The evidence shows that increasing lanes of motor traffic provides, at best, short-term relief to congestion. True congestion relief requires giving people safe alternatives to driving.\nPlease reject Bill 212 and protect bike lanes. For my family, they are essential.\n"

        "comment": "I believe bike lanes are critical to the infrastructure of the city for a few reasons. First, the safety of cyclist should be considered, as people are going to cycle to work with or without the bike lane, and therefore the lanes are important to enhance the protection of cyclists. Secondly, although our weather makes cycling year round challenging, there are many people that cycle to work. This should be encouraged as we seek to reduce our reliance on automobiles. Also, more safe bike lanes available in the city encourages people to cycle, get exercise and improve overall fitness.\nI strongly encourage the city and citizens to reject the province\u2019s proposal to limit bike lanes.\nThank you.\n"

The gridlock in this city has grown with it's population while the road infrastructure has not kept up. Removing lanes for cars and exclusively keeping it for cyclists does not help with this what so ever.\nEither add and upgrade the road infrastructure to support the growth in population (both in terms of road and parking availability) or atleast get out of the way of existing infrastructure to not make it worse.\n"
