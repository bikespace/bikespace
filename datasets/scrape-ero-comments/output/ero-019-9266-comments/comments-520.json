        "comment": "as an Ontarian I strongly believe that bike lanes are an important portion of alternative transport and moving away from carbon emitting vehicles e.g. your standard ice engine. Along with reducing congestion due to traffic flow allowing more people to travel in the same space. Moving us back 10 to 15 years is not a smart decision as far as bike lanes go the province should be mandating more bike and accessible traffic not less.\n"

        "comment": "I am in opposition of this proposal for many reasons. It has become apparent that the use of cars is highly encouraged within Ontario cities, leaving many folks who do not drive or cannot drive, at a disadvantage. Despite the city of Toronto being one of Ontario's most 'walkable cities', there is very little consideration for those who wish to travel by any other means of transportation other than a car. The use of bike lanes is an inherent part of our transportation systems, and once they are removed, citizens' options are reduced. I also understand there are arguments that the bike lanes are rarely used. This is not an accurate observation as it must be considered how developed the bike lanes are (line painting on the road vs. bike lane dividers) and the area in which the bike lanes are installed. In spaces within suburban towns, there will be less use of bike lanes as it may be difficult for people to access them. Instead of removing the bike lanes, it would be best to develop systems that make it easier for bike users to access the bike lanes from their homes (is there sufficient public transportation they can ride bikes to?). It is also no wonder everyone depends on their car to travel. I myself have attempted to travel by public transportation and walking and have found it incredibly dangerous (due to the cars) and difficult as there is no space for anything other than a car.\nOf course my position comes from someone who resides within Toronto. However, I had originally lived in the KW area and moved due to needing a car to travel within the city. The quality of my life has greatly improved since I can now move around the city without a car. If bike lanes are removed, that is robbing myself and others one of the few options we have.\n"

This will ultimately reduce traffic for the trips that need to be taken by car. Streets are more pleasant for everyone when there are more bicycles. Every driver is also sometimes a pedestrian, and framing this as a fight between drivers and bikers ignores the reality that our streets can work well for all of us.\n"

        "comment": "So let me get this straight.  The Provincial government at the whim of the Premier is going to spend millions of taxpayer dollars to tear out transportation infrastructure on Bloor, University and Yonge that was installed after years of public engagement, and cost millions to plan for, tender and build and he's going to do this with no understanding of the facts, and without due process?  This is ludicrous and a clear failure of leadership.\nRemoving these lanes will put HEALTH, SAFETY and LIVES of the Premier's constituents AT RISK and will result in another year of unnecessary construction activity that will make the transportation situation even worse.  Engineers, Doctors, drivers and those that use these safe cycle lanes have all spoken out against this scheme, citing numerous background work that show that cycle lanes do not cause congestion - rather, they reduce the need to use cars so that those using cars can have access to more roadway.\nMy suggestion is, if traffic flow in highly urbanized areas is an identified problem, that the province create a working group with municipalities to come up with methods of developing safe and equitable transportation infrastructure that will not increase vehicle congestion.  Rather, the Premier is simply creating a whole lot more red tape - its ridiculous to have provincial officials who know nothing of the local geography review proposals for local street improvements.  The MTO can barely complete even the most basic tasks in a timely manner, never mind adding the extra level of bureaucracy to their work. Its a recipe for gridlock.\nI drive a car, I cycle, I walk and take public transport, depending on which is the easiest way to get around.  You need to balance your decision making - please do not remove the Bloor, University and Yonge cycle lanes and revise the Bill so that it is more collaborative with the City of Toronto and those that live here.\n"

I do not support this bill, both in its removal of existing bike lanes and the addition of more bureaucracy to create new ones. There is no traffic on University even with the bike lanes, and Bloor is the same speed as it has ever been. I want the bike lanes there because I don't want to share lanes with cyclists as a driver and they do not want to share lanes with me. Removing the lanes will create a huge construction mess and make it even more difficult to drive downtown.\nI am also concerned about the addition of more bureaucracy and red tape to create new bike lanes. Wasn't this government elected to do the exact opposite? Let municipalities decide this stuff.\n"

        "comment": "While I love the idea of bike lanes and was excited when the bike lanes on Bloor street were being extended, it seems that the other road users do not adhere to protocol making me much less inclined to use them. I have seen numerous trucks and cars parked in the bike lanes, people walking in them like sidewalks, etc etc. There are cases in Toronto where cyclists using the bike lanes are still hit by cars and trucks that fail to check their blind spots and share the road. I think the removal of existing bike lanes is a waste of money, but I don\u2019t oppose stricter regulations on where the lanes are implemented. My biggest concern is the people driving vehicles that do not follow rules meant to keep all road users safe. If drivers follow the rules of the road as it pertains to sharing the road with bikes then bike lanes might not even be necessary. I would much rather see the funding go into more rigorous education for both cyclists and drivers so that existing roadways can be safely shared.\n"

All I'll do is ask: after more money is spent on removing the lanes, more time spent on construction - what happens when the Bloor and University continue being congested? What are the next steps? And is \"sticking it to the left\" really worth spending more money and adding more construction? Are there no cheaper ways to do this? Is there absolutely no other issue that the province currently faces that would benefit more from expenditure?\n"

        "comment": "It was my understanding that bike lanes can increase bike use which could lead to a reduction in congestion. Supporting this are several international (e.g. Paris, New York) as well as domestic examples of bike lanes growing in popularity and reducing travel times on roads. Further support is seen in the increase in usage of bikes from Toronto's bike share program. Anecdotally, I have several colleagues who use these bike lanes to get to and from work, with other co-workers suggesting that increasing bike lanes would lead them to using bikes to get to work as well. It would be unfortunate if this decision was made without ample evidence suggesting that removal of bike lanes would decrease congested roadways while also ignoring some of the benefits of bike lane usage. I would oppose this Bill given that it would reset some pretty significant progress on increasing the usage of greener and potentially more efficient modes of transportation.\n"

        "comment": "Bloor Street Bike Lanes\nThe main source of congestion along Bloor St West, between Bloor West Village and the Kingsway, is the choke point at the South Kingsway/Jane Street/Bloor St intersection\u2014a problem that existed well before the bike lanes and COVID-19. While adjusting traffic lights may help, adding more lanes here is unlikely to ease peak congestion meaningfully.\nFor the first time the bike lanes along Bloor allow cyclists to have a safe and direct route from the West Side of the Humber River to Bloor West Village and onward to midtown Toronto without going all the way down to the bike lanes along the lake. Without this bike lane there is no safe, level and direct way across the Humber anywhere near Bloor St. The only way is to go down to the Humber River and ride up the steep hills on both sides of the river which is very difficult for all but the fittest people.\nThe bike lanes have made the area along Bloor St safer for pedestrians, cyclists and motorists, who used to have to dodge cyclist trying to weave in an out of traffic and parked cars. I\u2019ve heard some elderly friends say it has reduced the stress they feel in driving on Bloor St.\nThe only way to safely provide better transportation and safety as thousand of new residents move into the proposed new higher rise buildings along the Bloor St corridor is a renewed emphasis on better public transit and a range of transportation options, including bikes and the new micro-mobility options, such as e-bikes and scooters. Just as when a new highway is built in Ontario it will take a few years for the volume of bikes and e-bikes to build up, but it will. There has already been a big increase between 2023 and 2024.\nPlease don\u2019t give up on making Toronto a safer and more sustainable city.\n"

Ontario has a huge problem with traffic congestion, and we should be prioritizing alternates to individual vehicles at all times. In April of this year, cyclist fatalities had already surpassed the total number from the previous year and this does not include injuries and near misses. I see absolutely no reason to make cyclists across the province less safe, while increasing red tape and administrative costs, in the service of a few additional traffic lanes which there is no evidence will have any significant improvements for communities.\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nThis bill is very short sighted and poorly researched as all it will accomplish the exact opposite of what it claims to: it will make traffic congestion worse.\nBike lanes mean less motor vehicles on the roads which, in turn, means less congestion. Not to mention that this is an incredibly expensive bill to implement. It will cost hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars to hire contractors to rip up these bike lanes so cars may use them. It also adds significant red tape for municipalities seeking to improve and build on bicycle infrastructure. Not to mention the waste of money that is paying public servants to review and approve/deny these applications and the waste that is paying public servants to prepare and revise these applications. Cyclists will be put in precarious positions or they will be biking on the sidewalks again which is dangerous for pedestrians. Instead, this bill should be seeking to make bike infrastructure easier to install and build upon so more people will feel and be safe biking which will reduce the congestion for cars on the lanes available to them. Also biking has many health benefits and enables busy people to maintain an active and healthy lifestyle via their commute. Let the people who need cars for health and accessibility reasons have that option while encouraging Ontarians who can pick an active mode of transit to use that mode be it biking or walking.\n"

        "comment": "As a Canadian and home owner in Toronto, I have serious concerns about Exempting Building 413 from the Environmental Assessment Act and the removal and strict limiting and regulation of bike lanes. Prioritizing personal cars is not scalable, sustainable, or good for the public health, and is not the right path forward for a city of this size, and\nExempting Building 413 from the Environmental Assessment Act poses significant risks. It can lead to adverse environmental effects, including habitat destruction, pollution, and loss of biodiversity. Public health risks may go unchecked, affecting nearby communities. The exemption reduces public participation and transparency in decision-making processes, limiting community input and scrutiny. It can undermine the rights and interests of Indigenous communities, as their concerns and traditional lands may not be adequately considered. Additionally, cumulative environmental impacts may not be accounted for, leading to long-term degradation of the environment. Potential negative impacts on local economies, such as tourism and agriculture, may not be properly evaluated and mitigated. Overall, exemptions compromise environmental protection, public health, and community involvement, leading to potentially irreversible damage.\nRemoving bike lanes is a bad idea for several reasons. Bike lanes provide a safe space for cyclists, reducing the risk of accidents and conflicts with motor vehicles. They encourage cycling as an alternative mode of transportation, helping to reduce traffic congestion. Promoting cycling over driving decreases air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to a healthier environment. Cycling promotes physical activity, improving public health and reducing healthcare costs. Bike lanes can boost local economies by increasing foot traffic to businesses and reducing transportation costs for residents. They make cities more accessible to a diverse range of people, including those who cannot afford a car. Integrating bike lanes into urban planning supports sustainable and resilient city development. Overall, bike lanes are essential for creating safer, healthier, and more sustainable urban environments.\nWe should be using data and consideration of future generations to create good policy, not anecdotes. Sustainable, scalable, and safe modes of transportation should be prioritized, like walking, public transit, and biking - not personal vehicles.\nThank you.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal should be withdrawn.\nPlanning for municipal bike lanes does not fall within provincial jurisdiction. The Ontario government does not have direct authority over the municipal planning process, which has been rightly delegated to respective municipal governments. In Toronto, planning decisions for bike lanes are part of a city-wide integrated Cycling Network Plan, which was the result of years of data collection, expert review, community consultations, and political decisions from Toronto's elected city council.\nThe Ontario government does not have adequate data collection, technical planning capacity & expertise, or adequate community consultation processes to make decisions about municipal streets. Municipal street are not the jurisdiction of provincial planning decisions. Provincial interference with municipal planning interferes with Municipal Plans. These are municipal planning decisions for a reason. Ontario should defer to elected municipal governments and their dedicated city planning departments to make these decisions.\nThis proposal will get people killed. Blocking or removing bike lanes will lead to significant numbers of preventable deaths and injuries from Ontario residents. Six Toronto residents have already died in 2024 alone due to inadequate bicycle safety infrastructure. Countless studies show protected bike lanes improve the safety of all road users, including drivers.  https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214140518301488\u2026\nRepeated studies from all over the world, including Ontario, show that bike lanes do not increase congestion. In fact, protected bike lanes are tool specifically designed to reduce car traffic in urban centres, based on decades of data and international best-practice. Top-tier cities around the world universally deploy protected bike lanes in urban cores for this reason. Removing bike lanes will make grid-lock worse, damage the city economy and hurt small businesses along bike lane routes.\nMany Toronto residents own cars, but choose to ride bikes downtown instead, to avoid gridlock traffic. By removing safe, protected transportation routes, many would chose to drive again instead, increasing traffic congestion.\nBill 212 is an attack on Ontario residents which will make traffic worse, lead to deaths and injuries, cause significant economic damage,\nOntario should rescind this dangerous, costly, misguided, and legally overreaching proposal and leave municipal planning decisions up to municipalities.\n"

All modes of transport deserve to be safe from getting from point A to point B and the bike lanes are an important safety measure not just for cyclists but also vehicles.\nWe know that there are more cyclists than the 1.2% you cite as the Toronto bike share program continues to see growth and will record its most trips completed in a year in 2024. People ride their bikes to visit friends, go to the grocery store, exercise, and more. These trips also deserve to be safe.\nIt is also disheartening to know that this government does not listen to experts on city design and traffic. Time and time again research has shown that bike lanes do not impact vehicle traffic and by taking away a bike lane you will just be increasing the space for gridlock. Knowing that this government does not listen to the experts on this topic it worries me about what other recommendations you would ignore.\nFor my safety and the safety of many other people that rely on bike lanes, I really hope that this bill does not pass.

Note that large cities of the world that drive their area's economies such as New York, London, and Tokyo all have robust public transit systems and cycling infrastructure.

Preserving and expanding bike lanes is critical to building a healthy, vibrant, and forward-thinking city for all.\n"
