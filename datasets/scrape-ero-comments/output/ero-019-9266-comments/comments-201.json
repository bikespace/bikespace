I frequently use bike share to get destinations out of walking distance and inconvenient to get to by transit; bike lanes have made it quicker and safer to do so. They have allowed me to replace a trip I would have otherwise taken my car for. How does disincentivizing me from riding a bike to instead taking a car reduce congestion? Why is the province micromanaging hyper-local planning decisions? How is this a conservative, limited-government approach?\nI\u2019m not a politically active person but I will protest removal of bike lanes which will measurably make my life more difficult.\n"

        "comment": "I love Toronto because it is a livable city! I am a car owner, a cyclist, a pedestrian, and a user of the TTC, I also take cabs and Uber rides to get around. Since the installation of the bike lanes on Bloor and on University, I feel safer moving about the city on my bike than I did when having to share a lane with cars. It\u2019s simply a faster way to get places. If I choose to take my own car, it simply adds to the traffic. On my bike, I breeze past the traffic, made up mostly of single occupancy vehicles, though often the bike lane is crowded too.  I always choose to use protected bike lanes where I can. If there isn\u2019t a protected bike lane option. I\u2019ll often choose another means of transportation that will add to congestion.\nAs a pedestrian, I feel safer on sidewalks with the added protection of a bike lane.\nAs a driver, I feel safer driving with separated bike lanes because it\u2019s easier to understand and predict the position and movement of cyclists.\nThe TTC is so underfunded that the reduction in service and increased crowding make it less efficient. We need to put more money towards effective public transit.\nGET PEOPLE OUT OF CARS WHERE POSSIBLE SO THAT THOSE WHO DON\u2019T HAVE OTHER OPTIONS CAN HAVE SPACE. THE ONLY WAY TO REDUCE CONGESTION IS TO REDUCE CARS. If you take away the bike lanes, bikes will either mix in with existing car traffic, or cyclists like me will choose to take our own automobile, adding to congestion.\nI strongly agree with the statement from the Bloor Annex BIA that our main streets are not meant to be highways. If the concern is businesses being affected, then pedestrians and cyclists are far more likely to stop than a car speeding by at 50km/hr.\nPerhaps consider the European model of intersections with timing for bike, pedestrian and car crossing at separate times.\n"

This legislation, if passed, is regressive car centric lunacy. Multi lane roads in cities not only affect the safety of cyclists but ALL road users, including pedestrians. It is not good for commercial interests either. We need to invest in as many modes of transportation as possible in our cities. This legislation does not address the reasons for \"gridlock\". Lack of housing, transportation and proper taxation all take a back seat to saving individual (who can afford) car owners over society at large including the environment. Environmental penalties of continuing this legislation will cost lives, the governments rationale for this legislation have not properly addressed environmental impacts of any sort.\n"

Removing bike lanes that safely separate the people who actually live here taking an eco friendly (and much faster) method of travel that helps to alleviate stress on an already over burdened transit system will result in deaths. All this in favor of transient motorists who add to our congestion problem and could potentially not even live in this city.\nIf you want to fix congestion improve transit, finish the LRT, the Ontario line. You need to offer viable alternatives to taking the car if you have any real desire to fix the problem. Adding more space for cars will just cause more congestion and make matters worse.\nPeople will die if those lanes are removed. The blood of those people will be on this government's hands.\n"

I am both a cyclist and a driver, and I do appreciate the inordinate time to get anywhere in a car.  I am also motivated by my own safety, as drivers now think it is ok to swear at me when I am legitimately on the road in my lane, and to threaten my life with their entitlement.  The research on bike lanes shows that they improve business locally, they get more people on bikes, and are used year round.  Bike lanes should be on roads, not sidewalks, for the safety of blind people, in particular.  Separated bike lanes are by far the best.  When you build a new highway, add in the road allowance for the bike.  Not rocket science.  Forcing bikes into so called quiet side streets is impossible in Toronto as ravines, rail right of ways, waterways, bridges, all are obstacles to getting to a destination.  Cyclists are not just out aimlessly riding around in circles, they are commuting as well.  Many neighbourhoods were built in culdesacs, further adding to the inability to navigate. My bike values are just as important as driving values.  If you really want to reduce gridlock, get the 407 back.\n"

        "comment": "The need for bike lanes should be determined at a municipal level, as municipalities know their needs best. Bike lanes keep cyclists safe, and reduce the number of drivers on the road. As a long time cyclist who bike commutes to work, bike lanes keep me safe. They also enable me to better visit local businesses. Without the lanes, I would not be able to stop at various businesses on my commutes. The government should be working toward facilitating alternate transportation methods to cars, including improving public transit options and supporting safe bicycling infrastructure. The focus in enabling more transport via cars is contributing to more carbon emissions when we should be working to reduce our carbon footprint to combat climate change. The government\u2019s prioritizing of cars not only harms cyclists, but disproportionately impacts people of lower income who rely on safe alternate transit methods such as cycling, and contributes to the worsening of our climate crisis. Protect bike lanes, protect cyclists, protect the environment.\n"

Bike lanes are the best way to help congestion outside of actually getting major projects done that have been truly causing congestion like the Eglington LRT.

Some of them are probably misguided, but I can't understand why they get so much attention, when other issues like on-street parking on arterials (which snarl traffic in a way that bike lanes never could) are completely ignored by the provincial government.\nAs someone who gets around central Toronto by car, bike, on foot, and on public transit, I would much rather the province start to take a closer look at why we allow lanes of precious road space to be taken up by parked cars at the busiest times of the day and week.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my deep concerns regarding Bill 212 \u2013 Building Highways Faster Act, 2024, currently under review for public consultation. This proposal reflects a narrow vision of transportation planning, prioritizing highway expansion without considering the long-term environmental, economic, and social consequences. This highway-centric model undermines Ontario\u2019s potential to invest in sustainable public transit solutions that can enhance quality of life for all residents, not just vehicle owners.\nThe proposal outlines the construction of highways like Highway 413, the Bradford Bypass, and the Garden City Skyway, aiming to reduce gridlock and expedite transport. However, international experience shows that building more highways only provides short-term relief. In Europe, cities such as Copenhagen, Vienna, and Zurich have demonstrated that investing in robust public transit infrastructure leads to enduring improvements in mobility and quality of life. These cities have shifted away from car dependency by expanding tram networks, bus systems, and bike lanes\u2014initiatives that have fostered cleaner air, reduced emissions, and more inclusive urban environments.\nOntario\u2019s strategy misses the mark by perpetuating car-centric urban development. It is particularly concerning that the legislation allows the overriding of municipal by-laws and expedites expropriation processes, stripping local governments and residents of their say in critical infrastructure projects. This approach prioritizes short-term traffic solutions at the expense of meaningful consultation and environmental accountability\u200b.\nI urge the Ministry of Transportation to reconsider this shortsighted plan. Rather than focusing on highways, Ontario should take inspiration from global cities that are leading the way with efficient, multi-modal public transit systems that cater to all socioeconomic groups. Improved public transit not only reduces congestion but also enhances public health, lowers emissions, and fosters vibrant, equitable communities.\nOntario stands at a crossroads. This is an opportunity to pivot toward sustainable, forward-thinking transit policies that benefit future generations. I hope the government will recognize that more highways are not the solution to gridlock. A greater emphasis on public transit investment is the only way to build resilient cities for tomorrow.\n"

        "comment": "As a Toronto resident and someone who both drives to work and bikes to get around the city, I strongly oppose this bill. While gridlock is certainly a problem, removing bike lanes will only cause further traffic as bikes would be forced to more closely mix with cars and people who otherwise would have chosen to bike will chose to contribute to traffic by driving.\nWhile driving, bike lanes give me peace of mind that I will not encounter a cyclist mixed with the cars. Driving on roads like Spadina Rd is a great example of the benefit of bike lanes. Spadina does not have protected bike lanes but still has plenty of bikers. The result is a need for hyper vigilance while driving on Spadina to avoid hitting the bikes, especially as the bikers weave to avoid parked cars or to turn. The bike lanes on University Ave in contrast makes driving a better experience than Spadina. I don't need to worry about a biker dodging around a car in front of me or trying to find a time to pass around a biker.\nFurthermore, the existence of bike lanes makes biking in the city a safe and viable option to get around. The bike lanes create an environment where leaving my car at home and choosing to bike to my destination is a viable option, and one which I often choose. By leaving my car at home, I don't contribute to the traffic on the streets or take up one of the limited parking spaces.\nThe solution to grid lock is not to force bikers onto the road.\n"

        "comment": "I am opposed to removing bike lanes. When I ride a bicycle, I am grateful that the road is safe and I don't have to worry about being hit by a car. Sadly, there have already been six people who have died riding their bike in the City of Toronto this year. I think we can all agree that one is too many. A world class city should not have this problem. I know the City has a Vision Zero target to eliminate cycling and pedestrian deaths, but I don't see how the city will get there without a protected bike lane on one of the only major east west routes for people who ride their bike to get to their job, the store, or to get home. Knowing that removing these bike lanes increases the chance of injury or death for somebody who is using a bicycle to live their life and get around is deeply troubling to me.\nI also occasionally do drive. When I'm driving, I'm honestly grateful to be on roads where there are bike lanes. I feel it's safer for both the cyclist and myself as a driver as I don't have to worry about suddenly needing to change lanes or being stuck behind a cyclist for long stretches of time. Removing the bike lanes simply means the cyclists will now be sharing the traffic lanes with cars. After all, people riding bikes have the same priorities as people driving. They're trying to get to work, get home, pick up some groceries, etc. As you may be able to tell, safety is something I care a lot about. As I also understand from the Toronto Deputy Fire Chief, there has been no ill effect on wait times for EMS and, in fact, response times have improved!\nI know since the pandemic that car sales have increased dramatically. Similarly, I know that the population in the GTA has grown. It's easy to look at bike lanes and say this is the problem causing congestion. However, I think we can agree that congestion is a problem everywhere including streets where there are no bike lanes and on highways (Certainly I see this when I'm driving). There are more people driving than ever. To me, the solution to this problem is ultimately in improving public transit and I know your government has made some investments here, like the Ontario Line and GO expansion, that will ultimately help but will take years to build. There's more that can be done to invest in public transit though and removing bike lanes won't change the number of cars or people driving on city streets.\nSafer cycling infrastructure creates more incentives for people to cycle, which in turn is a net benefit to the environment as more people chooses to bike than drive, which reduces emissions from cars.\nLastly, I'm concerned about the broader issue of how my taxpayer dollars will be used. Removing bike lanes will cost money. Who is going to pay for this and what could that money be used for instead that would actually have a positive impact for everyone? I don't think it is a good use of my tax dollars to rip out needed infrastructure. Moreover, I think the broader issues of requiring new bike lanes to be approved by a cabinet minister is needless red tape. What qualifications does a cabinet minister have to understand local context in communities that are not his own? It's counterintuitive that someone not from my community should be able to tell my community what is best. I would hope here again we can agree that this isn't very democratic and can only add red tape to the work that city councils are trying to do on behalf of their own communities. I'd rather my tax dollars be used more thoughtfully and let local communities decide what's best for their community.\n"
