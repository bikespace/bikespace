It would absolutely set back our city if they were to remove bike lanes. Please do some research into induced demand. The way to reduce traffic is not to increase lanes - it is to provide alternatives to driving. Please educate yourself.\n"

The bike lanes are hardly used and traffic is always bad. I have seen several instances of emergency vehicles stuck in traffic and unable to pass. I don't know how those bike lanes as they are ever got approved in the first place.\nPlease take them out and let us have our neighbourhood back!!!\n"

        "comment": "Good leadership is making the right decisions, not the easy decisions. When it comes to congestion the evidence is clear, there is absolutely no way to solve congestion with personal autombiles. None, zero, nada. If there was, then we wouldn't have congestion as we've been spending 100 years prioritizing personal autombiles. There are two ways to solve congestion, 1) Price it appropriately 2) Give people good alternatives to driving (like quality consistent mass transit and active transportation, dense neighborhoods with services nearby, etc) That is it, nothing else will work. That might be hard for people to understand, but it is the truth and this government knows it. However, this bill is taking the easy way out. Suggesting we can reduce congestion by building a highway and by removing options for alternative transportation options. The highway is a glorious waste of taxpayer funds and will saddle Ontario with a burdensome repair bill for eternity. Not much respect for the taxpayer there considering your own modelling knows it will do nothing to reduce congestion and will likely make it worse. Secondly you will spend over $50M removing active transportation which will again increase congestion, reduce positive health incomes, and get people injured all costing our healthcare system more. Again, where is the respect for the taxpayer?\nInstead I suggest scrapping this bill and start pricing congestion. Then take the proceeds and pay a dividend to all Ontarians. Those that don't drive much will be,.and those thanks drive a lot will benefit from the dramatic reduction in traffic. Win freaking win. You would be revolutionary, visionary leaders. Instead this bill puts you in a long list of North American leaders who take the easy way out because it sounds like building a highway should work, but again, if it did, we wouldn't be having this conversation.\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nI've never commented on a bill before, but had to do it with this one as it is the dumbest and pettiest bill I've heard of. If Doug Ford cares so much about city issues in Toronto he should run for mayor. Ripping things up will be a waste of taxpayer dollars. Getting people on bikes will get commute times down, if people don't feel comfortable biking they will drive. Bikes need to have a direct route to be viable. Didn't this government have something on reducing red tape? How is making any and every little one-block bike lane in the province getting approved by the minster reducing red tape? I'm in Ottawa and the focus on these little petty fights in Toronto is so silly (I could use other words but won't).\nThanks\n"

        "comment": "Just over a year ago, crossing South Kingsway at Bloor St W was terrible.  At least 3 times a week, someone would speed around the corner as I was crossing and almost hit me.  It was incredibly frustrating to see drivers disobey the signs and laws and common sense while they tried to make the light.  Over and over and over. It was infuriating and a pedestrian would have died there eventually.  I've seen grandmothers swearing at drivers for almost hitting them, 10 year olds facing off against cars who didn't obey their signals. It was ridiculous and unacceptable.\nAnd while that corner was one of the worst, there was a lot of rule breaking by cars going on all along Bloor. IT SHOULDN'T BE DANGEROUS TO WALK IN YOUR OWN NEIGHBOURHOOD.\nSince the bike lanes have gone in on Bloor St, life has been so much safer for pedestrians.  The narrowing of the lanes between Jane and Old Mill have made drivers far less reckless.\nUnless this provincial government wants to encourage unsafe driving, they should really rethink pushing through this ridiculous bill that is willing to sacrifice the lives of cyclists and pedestrians so that drivers can save 2 minutes off their travel time.  And let's not forget that emergency vehicle travel time HAS IMPROVED.\nAnd that this has been slapped onto a bill for the 413 highway makes it absolutely insulting. You can build your highway without endangering the lives of Torontonians.\n"

        "comment": "Gridlock is not something that will be fixed by removing other ways of transportation other than cars. Biking in the city is one of the best ways to get around, yet so dangerous due to the already lacking of bike lanes and weary drivers. Removing the bike lanes forces people to stop biking and get in their cars furthering the problem with gridlock as well as force people that need to bike to feel even less safe and risk injury. Reconsider, the safety of people will directly be cause by this decision.\n"

        "comment": "Dear Premier Ford ...\nMy wife and I are Etobicoke residents (Bloor and Prince Edward Drive area).  We fully support your initiative to control the installation of future bike lanes in Toronto and, particularly, we support the removal of existing bike lanes on major arterial thoroughfares - Bloor Street, Yonge, and University/Avenue Road.\nWe have been very negatively impacted by the recent bike lane extension through the Bloor West / Kingsway area.  The bridge over the Humber River is a crucial artery and the recent bike lane installation has catastrophically hindered the entry to, and exit from, this crucial bridge.  Of all roadways, this bridge should have been left as it was, to carry maximum road traffic for safe and efficient movement across the city.\nWe have just returned from a mid-day shopping trip to the Bloor West area, and experienced a huge 3-block car backup heading into the city (from the Jane/Bloor intersection to mid-way across the Humber Bridge).   We did not see a single cyclist at any time as we passed through this area, but we saw dozens of slowly moving cars that should have been moving briskly into and out of this area.\nPlease, remove the recent bike lane installation through the Bloor West / Kingsway area, and return some sanity and efficiency to our roadways.  A mandatory road safety training for all cyclists would help contribute to both safe and efficient cycling use of our existing road structure.  We don't need new bike lands - we need both drivers and cyclists aware of safe and courteous use of our roadways.\n"

        "comment": "The bike lanes in Toronto are a critical infrastructure, ensuring a safe and accessible means of transportation for the city\u2019s numerous cyclists. By providing a buffer from vehicular traffic, these lanes significantly reduce the risks associated with cycling on streets without dedicated lanes. Proposals to remove bike lanes on major thoroughfares are not only shortsighted but also pose serious safety concerns for residents. Eliminating these lanes will not deter cyclists; instead, it will force them onto more hazardous streets, inevitably increasing the likelihood of accidents. Furthermore, such a decision would exacerbate traffic congestion, as cyclists\u2014unable to rely on safe infrastructure\u2014compete for space with vehicles. This proposal reflects a disregard for both public safety and the broader implications for urban mobility.\n"

        "comment": "What\u2019s concerning is that no year-round data was ever used in developing the citywide cycling plan. It wasn\u2019t presented during so-called \u201cpublic consultations\u201d about extending bike lanes into our neighborhoods, nor has it been included in any post-installation assessments. A reasonable, transparent planning process would have considered year-round figures from the start\u2014during planning, public input, and evaluations. Ignoring data is a major oversight.\nAccurate data is essential for both current decision-making and future bike lane planning. By analyzing year-round usage patterns, planners can allocate resources effectively and design lanes that truly meet the needs of all road users, resulting in safer transportation options for everyone. That didn't happen.\nI support logical bike lanes based on actual year-round usage, but reject those that are underused, increase congestion, endanger pedestrians, and harm businesses\u2014especially when distorted statistics push a narrow agenda that ultimately hurts everyone, including cyclists.\nEnough is enough. The City, its head of transportation services Barbara Gray, and cycling groups must stop obscuring the truth with selective data. I demand full transparency and integrity in reporting. Let\u2019s see the complete picture\u2014365 days of data, including seasonal and time-of-day details\u2014so Torontonians can make informed decisions about our streets. Only by confronting reality can we build a transportation system that genuinely serves the needs of our community, not just a vocal minority.\n"

        "comment": "More people travel by means other then cycling on major roads.  Our major roads are deigned to move the largest volume of traffic.  Its then logical that these route do so.  Bike lanes should be placed Primarily on residential roads where they can take the full lane and not clog up the major roadways.  As a result of theses lanes on our major roads traffic has diverted onto residentail streets with all the noise and by nature all the dangers on dark residentail streets with bad visibility where our children play.  We need data collection for a full year so that we can compare bike use to all other road users including those on transit.  The solution to traffic is TRANSIT NOT BIKE LANES\nLegislation should also include that bike lanes not cause ANY delay to transit.  Stop the obsurdity and virtue signaling!\n"

        "comment": "We are writing to express our full support for the proposed BILL 212.   As  concerned residents, we believe this decision is crucial to resolving several serious issues caused by the bike lanes, and we appreciate the Provincial Government\u2019s attention to this matter.\nSince the installation of the bike lanes, we have witnessed a significant increase in road congestion, leading to longer commute times and greater frustration for drivers. This has been especially problematic here in Etobicoke where traffic flow has been severely disrupted due to the removal of vehicle lanes.\nAdditionally, the bike lanes have contributed to a decline in business for local shopkeepers, as the lack of parking and ease of access to their stores has made it more difficult for customers to stop and shop. The increased congestion and restricted road access are negatively impacting the livelihoods of small businesses that form the heart of our community.\nFrom a safety standpoint, the bike lanes have also created unsafe conditions for pedestrians. In many areas, the reduced road space has forced people to walk closer to traffic, increasing the risk of accidents and making it harder for families and seniors to navigate our streets comfortably.\nThe impact on emergency services is another concern. Response times for paramedics, fire trucks, and police vehicles have been delayed due to the blocked lanes, which is a serious risk to the well-being of residents in urgent need of assistance. PLEASE DO NOT BELIEVE ANYTHING THE CITY IS SAYING REGARDING IMPROVED RESPONSE TIMES BY FIRST RESPONDERS.\nFinally, the bike lanes, despite their significant cost and disruption to the community, are simply not being used. The absence of cyclists using these lanes on a regular basis has made it clear that the intended benefits of this infrastructure are not being realized.\nGiven these ongoing problems, we fully support BILL 212.  Removing the bike lanes and restoring proper traffic flow, safer conditions for pedestrians, and better access to local businesses is crucial to bring back our neighbourhoods.  We believe this BILL is an essential step in addressing the needs and concerns of the broader community.\nThank you for your attention to this important issue. We appreciate your commitment to finding practical solutions that work for all residents, and we look forward to seeing positive changes for our city.\nSincerely,\nCONCERNED RESIDENTS\nP.S.  We hope you do not believe the cost estimate provided by the City of Toronto to remove the bike lanes.  This exaggerated number only demonstrates that the folks at Toronto City Hall cannot be trusted.\n"

        "comment": "I live in Etobicoke near Royal York and Bloor and I am in favour of keeping the newly installed bike lanes. Almost everyday I walk up to Bloor Street and observe the traffic moving steadily, even during rush hour. It may be a little slower than it used to be, but cars are not excessively backed up (as they tend to be on Royal York). There is no gridlock.\nI usually see at least one and often 4-6 two-wheeled vehicles in the bike lanes when shopping along Bloor. I am happy that cyclists have a safe place to travel. I do not want bike lanes removed because I do not want such vehicles travelling on the side walks. This is unsafe for pedestrians.\nI acknowledge that our bike lanes are not heavily used right now. However whenever I take the subway East to Ossington, I surface to see a constant stream of bikes etc. in both directions. That neighbourhood has a higher population density than Royal York and Bloor. However there are numerous condo developments ready to start in my neighbourhood and more buildings going up along the corridor between Islington and Six Points. As we have more residents moving into apartments and condos in the area, we will have more bicycle, e-bike and e-scooter traffic. Many people living in apartments and condos don't even own cars.\nMovement of emergency vehicles along Bloor is considered a problem by the critics of bike lanes. I would suggest that the planters in the middle of the street between Montgomery and Prince Edward be removed, to create a centre lane for emergency vehicles to use. Streetscape is nice, but roadways should be used for accommodation of all traffic including cars and bikes.\n"
