        "comment": "I believe that limiting the expansion of bike lanes\u2014and potentially reducing existing ones\u2014would be a beneficial and safety-focused approach for everyone navigating busy urban areas like Toronto.\nAs someone who once avoided driving in the city due to its intensity, I\u2019ve experienced the benefits of having a car, which has allowed me to broaden my work opportunities and accomplish more. Relying on public transit alone simply isn\u2019t as productive for those with complex schedules.\nIn my experience, I\u2019ve observed an ongoing tension between drivers, pedestrians, and cyclists, which is affecting our ability to make sensible adjustments suited to city life. While bike lanes along high-traffic streets like Queen Street may serve some cyclists, they often compromise safety. I have personally witnessed cyclists adopting the behaviors of both vehicles and pedestrians, whichever suits them at the moment. This unpredictability endangers pedestrians crossing the street and drivers making turns. Cyclists often fail to dismount at crosswalks, which would increase their visibility and promote safer interactions. Unfortunately, this can escalate into confrontations, adding to an already tense atmosphere on the roads.\nAlthough significant investments have already been made to incorporate bike lanes on major streets, I believe it's not too late to consider safer, alternative routes. Rerouting some bike lanes through parallel residential streets would offer cyclists a safer path and reduce conflicts on the busiest roadways. This is a solution that could address safety concerns more effectively while remaining considerate of all users of our streets.\nAdditionally, I strongly support the idea of requiring cyclists to complete a knowledge or practical module to obtain a license for using bike lanes on city streets. Many smaller countries have similar sensible systems, and they have proven effective in promoting road safety for all.\nThank you for your dedication to creating a more efficient, safe, and balanced city.\n"

        "comment": "I've lived downtown for almost two decades and bike lanes are an essential infrastructure for a rapidly expanding population in a major metropolitan. Many people including myself rely on this as a means of commuting around the city that is already congested by traffic that has always been an issue pre-pandemic, and even now. The reality is, the city is growing in population at such a rapid pace that we need all forms of infrastructure to allow people to get around.\nThe city already suffers from limited reliable infrastructural network for public transportation, removing a bike lane would add further burden to those networks. Also, while many critics of the bike lanes cite  that lack of usage of such infrastucture, much of this new bike infrastructure is incomplete and is lagging in its network size, but this is something that is improving rapidly so to remove them is a huge step backwards in city planning for the future.\nIf the city's goals is promoting safe, cleaner means of transportation for a population, then without a doubt biking infrastructure should be a top priority.\n"

This government is consistently trying to reduce services and infrastructure put in place to help citizens for seemingly their own benefit (Ontario Place/Science Centre/Greenbelt). I live in Toronto and use these bike routes daily to get to work safely. I know many people who have been injured due to lack of designated bike lanes. If the point of this proposal is to reduce bike lanes on major roads, give us a clear plan and timeline to implement these safe routes along other roads.\nAs someone who I can only assume doesn't ride a bike or even drive their own car, why is Doug Ford making decisions about this issue.\n"

        "comment": "Reducing bike lanes in cities will only increase car traffic and pollution by eliminating an alternative mode of transportation. Build it and they will use it is a proven way of increasing cycling as transportation. Unsafe cycling will only result in less cycling. While other cities in the world like Paris are actively reducing car traffic in their core, Ontario/Toronto appears to be going backwards. Reducing the impacts of polluting vehicles, increasing safe cycling, affording citizens safe and healthy ways of moving around the city seem to be obvious solutions to many problems. Only a short-sighted government would even consider doing away with bike lanes or limiting their implementation. If the bike lanes get reduced or their implementation is limited, I know that I will NOT be voting for the FORD Government. I will be voting for the party that supports cycling and a future for my children.\n"

        "comment": "I understand the desire to address volume of traffic on Ontario roads, however, a key element your proposal has missed is providing transportation options that get drivers off the roads and streets. Bicycle lanes do precisely that - give commuters safe and accessible lanes to get to work or to appointments/ destinations.\nInvest in public transit- trains can carry commuters.\nThe proposals seem to place all priority and assumed productivity on people inside of vehicles. That is a very narrow view.\nLook at Copenhagen, Amsterdam and other progressive sustainable urban transport  models.\nAlso - proposals show considerable over-reach of provincial government power into the affairs of municipalities. Will the Ford government create yet another layer of bureaucracy and impair the efficiency of local governments?\nAs a province, let\u2019s move forward and encourage, rather than hinder, local municipal solutions to local transportation issues. I have no sympathy whatsoever for Mr Ford who believes productivity across Ontario is at stake when he himself is frustrated by being caught in traffic in his region. Try cycling to work Mr Ford. Or try transit.\n"

        "comment": "As a Torontonian who walks, drives and cycles city streets, I support bike lines.\nWe know from evidence that bike lanes help to:\n- reduce gridlock\n- reduce greenhouse gases\n- get people moving faster\nBike lanes are not just a matter of convenience; they are vital for many residents who rely on affordable transportation options. Delivery drivers, including those in food and courier services, as well as individuals who simply cannot afford vehicles due to the high cost of living, depend on both public transportation and bike lanes to move around the city. The rising cost of living has made car ownership unattainable for many, further highlighting the need for equitable, accessible alternatives like cycling infrastructure.\nWe must also recognize that traffic congestion is self-perpetuating. More cars on the road lead to more traffic. It\u2019s a cycle that anyone who takes a moment to reflect on the situation would easily understand. Expanding bike lanes offers an opportunity to break this cycle by encouraging more people to use alternative modes of transport, thereby reducing overall congestion and improving the flow of traffic for everyone.\nInvesting in safe, accessible bike infrastructure is essential for the health, safety, and well-being of our communities, as well as for addressing the city\u2019s pressing environmental and transportation challenges. These actions are not only distractions from the real needs of our city but also betray a lack of vision and leadership when it comes to addressing urban challenges. Bike lanes are a practical, immediate step that can provide tangible benefits for Toronto residents, but we need all levels of government working together, in good faith, to make them a reality.\nStreets with subways under them are not streets where most need to drive, these are exactly the places where bike lanes make the most sense.\nWe need a government that supports making decisions that are based in evidence. The Ford government\u2019s proposed plan to limit bike lanes in Ontario would undermine municipal decision-making, worsen traffic congestion and hinder efforts to create safer, more sustainable streets.\n"

Traffic is terrible and people should be encouraged to use other modes of transportation in Toronto, such as public transit and bikes. This bill will make it harder and less safe for people to use bikes, particularly in Toronto, discouraging people from using alternatives to cars. This is a shortsighted proposal. The province should be Investing in bike lanes and biking infrastructure, as well as public transit, rather than dismantling and reducing it.\nAdditionally, the Province should not be creating powers for it to override municipalities regarding planning for municipal roads, and adding requirements for municipalities to check in and report to the province. This will create extra burden and red tape for no reason. Municipal governments should be able to exercise their powers to plan and implement projects without burdensome oversight.\n"

        "comment": "There are countless reasons that installing bike lanes should be prioritized and made easier, but here are just a few:\nSpace:\nBike lanes take up half the space as traffic lanes, but move 6x as many citizens within the space. Most cars on the road, especially during rush-hour traffic, only hold one passenger. 6 passengers on a bike would take up the same amount of space.\nEnvironmental impact:\nOur atmosphere is heating up at an insurmountable rate, and making biking to work easier and safer for citizens is an economically sound way to encourage carbon-free transit. The proof is in the pudding: when biking is safer, more people do it.\nCost:\nA bike costs a fraction of the price of a car. It does not require a license, fuel or battery charging, or insurance, making it infinitely more accessible to low-income citizens and the youth. The growing expectation that one\u2019s $60,000, 2-ton death-machine made of metal gives them more right to the roads than a small, inexpensive bicycle is entirely convoluted. A car is a luxury, not a right. Just because one buys a fancy and unnecessary toy, does not mean that they are more entitled to getting around town than someone who has chosen not to buy one. If anything, the extravagance should come with restrictions.\nSafety:\nA collision between a car and a pedestrian= death\nA collision between a car and cyclist= death\nA collision between cyclist and pedestrian= injury\nA collision between cyclist and cyclist= injury\nWe should not be prioritizing a more dangerous method of travel.\nSummary:\nBike lanes are completely necessary to the progression of our cities and municipalities. They allow everyone to get around safely without a massive cost. If it takes a car longer to get somewhere than a bike, it is not the cyclists fault. A car is big and therefore harder to manoeuvre; Impediment of speed within small city streets is a natural consequence. It does not matter how many lanes you put in. If the place drivers are going is only so big, they can only get there so fast. If they want to be faster, they should become smaller.\nDrivers are entitled. Cyclists deserve safe routes.\n"

        "comment": "To whom this may concern,\nWith all due respect, this proposal makes no sense. You're wasting taxpayer dollars and should stay out of the municipality's lane, pun intended.\n1) This proposal makes no sense:\nThe proposal assumes that converting bike lanes back to motor vehicle lanes will reduce gridlock, yet data from various cities, including Toronto, suggests the opposite. Studies have shown that bike lanes can ease congestion by offering an alternative to driving, reducing the number of vehicles on the road (1,2,&3). Even Toronto's own data shows that travel time got longer and traffic moved slower in the years following the removal of bike lanes on Jarvis Street in 2011 (1). In Toronto, bike lanes on Bloor Street, for example, have resulted in more efficient traffic flow and increased safety for all road users. In New York City, the authors shared figures from the city's transportation department that showed in 2010, before bike lanes were installed on a major midtown thoroughfare, it took the average car 4.5 minutes to travel from 96th Street to 77th Street. After the bike lanes were installed, it took just three minutes \u2014 a 35 percent decrease. One of the reasons they cited for the change was the installation of a left-turn lane, which not only kept cyclists moving but also stopped cars from holding up traffic. In some Canadian cities, particularly Montreal, Vancouver and Edmonton, bike lanes are widely used. Montreal has a whopping 1,065 kilometres of bike lanes, and Edmonton has more than 800 kilometres, with more planned.\nEven on a simple logical level, if adding \"one more lane\" fixed traffic congestion issues, why does the 401 still have traffic when passing through Toronto even though new lanes keep getting added? Perhaps giving people an alternative to driving, say a train, would reduce the number of people driving on the 401 to get to their destination. With this same logic, if people had no other way to get around other than by car since you removed the bike lanes, wouldn't that force more people to drive, adding more cars onto the road, and thus making traffic worse? Plenty of evidence seems to back up this thinking (2&3).\nRegardless of whether the bike lanes are there or not, people will still bike. Bike lanes make the streets safer for those who choose to bike, without resulting in car traffic congestion. It is common sense that the government's job is to protect citizens. Why not make positive decisions, instead of wasteful decisions, for the people that you represent?\n2) You're wasting taxpayer money:\nThe proposal contradicts the government\u2019s claim of fiscal responsibility. Removing bike lanes wastes the original investment to build them and adds new removal costs. Additionally, the government has spent hundreds of millions on questionable projects, diverting funds from priorities like healthcare and education. Estimates suggest taxpayers could have saved $6-7 billion with more responsible spending from the Ontario Liberal Party's spending.\nYour government claims to be against wasting taxpayer money (despite wasting it on getting alcohol in corner stores, 30 million to fight the federal price on carbon, 4 million in ads to fight the feds, 231 million to cancel green renewables to only then start putting them back in again, 30 million failed gas pump stickers, 35 million for an environmental study for 413 highway, 20.8 million wasted on \"Building a Better Health System\" ads, 13.5 million wasted on \"it's happening here\" ads, 13.5 million on \"Ontario is getting stronger\" ads (which for both those ads, didn't you promise to reverse the changes to advertising rules in 2018, but that would be asking you to follow through on campaign promises) I could go on but I think you get the point that your government is terrible at spending ($377.8 MILLION DOLLARS WASTED) on actual priorities like healthcare and education), and ripping up bike lanes wastes the money put in to build them and the money to remove them. Talk about wasteful spending. There is a study by the Fraser Institute that suggests if your government would have spent the same as the Ontario Liberal government, relative to GDP, Ontario taxpayers would have saved between $6 and 7 BILLION DOLLARS. Please stop wasting our money.\n3) Stay out of the municipality's lane:\nThis move directly contradicts the provincial stance against federal interference in provincial matters, as voiced by Doug Ford at the Council of Federation meeting in July 2024. For a government that advocates respecting jurisdiction, this intervention in municipal decisions is inconsistent and overreaching. One might even say hypocritical...\n4) Health and safety benefits of biking:\nBike lanes help separate cyclists from car traffic, reducing their exposure to vehicle exhaust and improving respiratory health. In areas where bike lanes are prominent, the decrease in car use also benefits pedestrians and residents by reducing overall air pollution levels.\nRemoving bike lanes would reduce safe cycling infrastructure, potentially increasing the risk of accidents for cyclists. Cities worldwide have implemented bike lanes as part of \u201cVision Zero\u201d policies, aiming to reduce traffic fatalities. Reducing bike infrastructure could compromise cyclist safety and increase fatality risks, which contradicts global best practices in urban safety. After the installation of the bike lane, the proportion of visitors who perceived Bloor Street as safe for cycling more than tripled (from 17% to 61%) and doubled among merchants (from 13% to 27%), while perceptions of safety on Danforth, a similar street without bike lanes, dropped (from 22% to 10%). Source (4). Cities with dedicated bike lanes tend to have lower rates of traffic accidents involving cyclists. Fewer injuries mean reduced healthcare costs and less strain on emergency medical services. The cumulative health benefits of increased cycling (i.e., cardiovascular health, stress and anxiety reduction, weight management, musculoskeletal health, development of type 2 diabetes, stroke, and some cancers) can lead to a significant reduction in public healthcare costs. When more people cycle regularly, the community benefits from a healthier population and less demand for medical resources.\n5) Benefits to local businesses:\nFor a government that (falsely) claims it helps local businesses, it has been proven that bike lanes have a positive impact on local businesses (4). Both before and after the bike lane, customers who arrived by foot or on bike reported higher levels of spending on Bloor Street than those arriving by car or transit. The number of businesses that reported 100 customers or more per day increased in the study area on both streets. The percentage of customers cycling to Bloor nearly tripled (from 7% to 20%), a substantially higher increase than on Danforth Avenue, which has no bike lane.  The majority of merchants believed that at least 25% of their customers are driving to Bloor; however FEWER THAN 10% of customers reported arriving by car.\nTo summarize, this proposal is to rip out bike lanes: ineffective at reducing traffic congestion as having alternatives to driving reduces gridlock, a waste of taxpayer money, municipal overreach, will cause serious health and safety risks to bikers and society at large, and will reduce the economic benefits for local businesses. Please stop playing partisan politics and do what is right for the people of Ontario.\nRespectfully,\nA concerned citizen\n"
