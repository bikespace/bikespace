My taxpayer dollars went towards a project I support and use, hearing I may need to pay some more to remove it sickens me.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes will not improve traffic, but it will come at the cost of cyclists' lives. The idea of removing the biggest bike lane routes in the city is absolutely ludicrous. If you want to clear up road space, take out street parking on major arterial roads. Those cars just sit and block traffic more than a bike lane. The best way to improve gridlock is to promote methods of transport to move more people at once - public transit and cycling.\nNot everyone can afford a car to get around, so it appears that Mr. Ford is looking to endanger the lives of people less fortunate than himself, and that's extremely disheartening.\n"

        "comment": "This is a gross overreach by the province. I thought we were supposed to be getting rid of red tape and here you are, adding more. City traffic will not get better when you take out bike lanes. It will stay exactly the same? Why? Because when you give people more space for cars to fit, guess what, you\u2019ll get more cars on the road and they\u2019ll be gridlock. What we should actually be spending time and money on is alternatives for cars. Better and more affordable transit, walking and biking infrastructure will decrease cars on the road and ease gridlock. Please stop this and focus on more important issues going on in our province.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my deep concern regarding the proposed bill that would remove bike lanes and impose restrictions on how new ones can be added. As a daily cyclist, this decision will have a profound impact on my family and me.\nMy wife and I rely on cycling exclusively for every aspect of our lives. We commute a combined distance of 25 km each day to get to work, bring our kids to school, do our groceries, shopping local store in the city, and visit friends and family. We don\u2019t own a car because it\u2019s too expensive, and now I feel like I\u2019m being discriminated against because of this. The recent statement from the Minister of Transportation claiming that \u201cthe car is king\u201d is especially troubling. It sends the message that our needs and safety as cyclists are secondary.\nI\u2019m genuinely worried about the increased risks my family will face if bike lanes are removed. Cycling with my kids on busy roads will become even more dangerous, and this decision feels like it prioritizes cars over the well-being of residents like me. Furthermore, I\u2019m deeply concerned about the future of the environment. If we don\u2019t encourage alternatives like bikes and public transportation, we\u2019re setting ourselves up for further environmental harm.\nIf this bill passes, it feels like my family and I are being told that we\u2019re not wanted here in this province. This legislation would make it difficult for us to live safely, and I\u2019m sure many others feel the same way. I strongly urge the government to reconsider this bill and think about the long-term impact on all residents, not just car owners.\n"

        "comment": "Please do not let Doug Ford remove bike lanes. toronto needs more bike lanes, not less. To reduce congestion we should concentrate on making public transit more convenient and efficient. There has been too many pedestrians struck by cars. Drivers in the city are not always experienced or suited to city driving and cause a lot of problems. There should also be stricter enforcement of who gets a license. There are a lot more bad drivers who endanger pedestrians, cyclists and other drivers.\n"

        "comment": "Hi Staff,\nI am a resident of Ontario that consistently drives and cycles around the entire region especially in Toronto and its major routes like Bloor, University, and Yonge. Ever since the new protected bicycle lanes have been added to these routes, me and my family have felt much more safe and protected from traffic. We constantly use these bike lanes every single day since they make riding our bikes to the places where we need to be safe and convenient while allowing us to use the most direct route. We genuinely feel like our lives are not at risk for choosing our bikes over other methods of transportation.\nWhen driving, I also find myself experiencing less conflicts between others on bikes allowing for me and other drivers to get around more efficiently through these corridors. Forcing bicycles to share traffic lanes would only make these conflicts more common and drastically impact traffic flow and the safety of everyone.\nI would love to see proper research that backs up the Province's statement about how \"bike lanes cause traffic congestion.\" From my experience, they not only improve congestion as well as save lives. Even when a car lane is removed, bike lanes have consistently made my experience as a driver and cyclist better. Not only that, they also allow my family to get around quickly, efficiently, and safely.\nIf the Province truly wants to fix traffic congestion, I would highly encourage it to finish existing transit projects as well as focus on providing viable alternatives to driving instead of encouraging even more of it, and putting people's lives in danger.\nPlease reconsider this legislation or at the very least provide proper backing with data, facts, and common sense.\nBest Regards,\nMatt\n"

        "comment": "The bike lanes in the city are the only safe, convenient and affordable way for many of us Toronto residents to get to and from work and around the city. Not all of us can afford $3.40 every time we need to get on TTC, therefore we rely on our bikes year round as our main mode of transport.\nTaking away bike lanes will not alleviate congestion, rather it will lead to more congestion with traffic having to dodge cyclists on all roads, resulting in higher possibility for cyclist accidents and deaths. Studies around the world have proven that bike lanes are a better solution for intra-city transit and reducing city congestion and congestion on public transit.\nI truly hope the government doesn\u2019t remove what few safe lanes we have just to encourage more cars and buses to travel through the downtown core.\n"

        "comment": "I'm sure you won't listen to us, however this piece of legislation looks like Communism to me.  Here you are telling a democratically elected body (Toronto City Council) how to conduct business.  This is what they do in China and Russia.  Furthermore the cyclists in the City are not going anywhere, in fact 30% of the City does not drive a car.  So this new policy will make the streets less safe for bikers and frankly everyone.  It will end up in more deaths on the streets of Toronto.  That is a fact.  Hope you can sleep at night knowing you'll be responsible for the deaths of those cyclists and pedestrians that will ultimately occur.  And it won't improve gridlock that is not the cyclists fault or the bike lanes for that matter.  Study after study has proven that cars cause traffic and deaths.  Big Cities around the World are installing bike lanes and pedestrian friendly areas to promote safety and community.  It appears the Conservative gov't wants to go in the opposite direction, imposing Communist style top down Totalitarian policy.\n"

        "comment": "It is a shame that the premier has decided to wage a war against cyclists in this city while trying to push through a bill that would cause untold environmental damage to our wonderful province with the expedited construction of 413. Numerous studies (I would say all or the large majority of them) show that bike lanes do NOT effect traffic congestion and actually ease it by providing people alternative methods of transportation. Construction of both rail projects that the government is letting drag on causes more congestion. The lack of public transit options causes congestion. Cars cause congestion. All this will lead to is more frustration from drivers when bikes are on the road legally taking up a lane which will result in more injuries and deaths from vehicles hitting cyclists. The Ford government needs to take its hands off Toronto and allow the municipal government to govern the city like they were elected to do instead of messing with our affairs to settle a grudge and appease their developer friends. Cyclists will make driving more difficult for drivers if these lanes are removed and they will be within their legal right to do so.\n"

As with similar policies, this will lead to an increase in government spending, a reduction in safety, and an increase in traffic congestion where I live. I am strongly against this proposal.\n"

        "comment": "As a regular user of bike lanes in Toronto, especially the Bloor St. one, I am shocked by the Provincial government's proposal to dictate, and limit, how Municipal governments implement bike lanes. We should be actively encouraging bike lanes as they provide a healthy, environmentally friendly, and pro-business means of travel. An absence of bike lanes makes riding a bike on city streets incredibly dangerous, as we've witnessed with countless unnecessary deaths from car collisions with bike riders when lanes aren't available.\nI believe this bill to be a terrible idea, setting back the progress that has been made on allowing cities to grow their own bike lane networks. Adding more red tape by requiring provincial approval will do nothing but waste time and tax payer money. The car congestion this bill claims to address is a result of too many cars, underfunded public transit systems, and not enough transit alternatives. Scapegoating bike lanes won't result in any meaningful improvement should they be limited or removed.\n"

        "comment": "This is a painfully misguided bill. The idea that \u201canother lane will fix it\u201d is so out of touch, it has been debunked and memed and tested and nothing good ever comes of just dedicating more space to cars. Cars which primarily have only one person in it. This bill is just virtue signalling some small group of people obsessed with hating bike lanes. If the province wanted to improve mobility and reduce gridlock, it wouldn\u2019t be focused on cars, but on high speed rail, bus services, last mile transit, shared bike infrastructure, better accessible access\u2026 there\u2019s so much potential to do great things, that removing a safe and healthy mode of transport is truly ridiculous. Bike lanes are beautiful!\nCars which primarily infrastructure does not scale. If we continue to depend on every person getting their own car, we\u2019ll just need another highway in a few years. Our cities get further apart, and it becomes even harder to commute.\nNow is the time to commit to actually removing gridlock. Not by making room for the gridlock to grow, but by literally reducing the amount of vehicles creating the gridlock in the first place. Give people better alternatives.\n"
