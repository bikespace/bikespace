        "comment": "Please vote no for this, as removing the 3 bike lanes in downtown Toronto looks ineffective, wasteful of our taxpayer money, and counter-productive for Toronto\u2019s economy and neighbourhood safety.\nNo one likes traffic. But there are far better ways to remove congestion in Toronto. Consider New York City, which also has hundreds of miles of bike lanes. Its system of one way streets adds a lane and removes the gridlock from left & right turners. Toronto\u2019s street parking on major roads like Bathurst also blocks car lanes downtown and adds congestion \u2014 for even fewer to benefit. Please do a thoughtful review of what will help the city\u2019s neighbourhoods thrive and drivers\u2019 commutes before jumping to knee-jerk reversals for systems that weren\u2019t working well before either.\nThere is also a safety concerns with removing lanes on these busy streets. We spent years teaching the local communities to bike these streets for their weekly routines. I\u2019ve seen cargo bikes with kids become a common sighting on Bloor. The bikes will not disappear when these lanes are removed. Commuters and community members will get hurt. There were good reasons these lanes were installed.\nLet\u2019s address the traffic congestion in a manner that is productive and farsighted.\n"

        "comment": "I am in absolute disbelief that the Ford government would try to go ahead with getting rid of existing bike lane infrastructure in Toronto - finally after so many years.  While the bike lanes on Bloor are not perfect they are a far step above of what used to be there. In fact, Bloor St., since the bike lanes, has been less congested from my daily experience of cycling there than prior to having bike lanes.  To suggest that bike lanes are creating congestion is ludicrous and wrong.  In Ford's proposal there is no discussion about creating better transit and reducing vehicular traffic that increased tenfold during the pandemic.  I do know this is a political move but it is one that will actually create more gridlock and ultimately grind this city to a halt.  As a cyclist and a driver I think this is a very impulsive and destructive move/proposal.  Toronto goes two steps forward then once again a thousand steps backward.  Not a world class city at all.\n"

I urge you to STOP your attack on the city\u2019s bike lanes. Your mandate is to move people safely and efficiently. Bike lanes ALLOW FOR THE SAFE AND EFFICIENT MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE. How can you in good conscience promote an obviously flawed policy? Your government has cited NO studies to suggest bike lanes cause traffic. They do the EXACT OPPOSITE. Less people in cars means less traffic! That is common sense.\nBike lanes improve business activity. The BIA of the Bloor Annex area literally released a statement with supporting statistics.\nBike lanes promote safety for cyclists, who will\nstill use these important arterial roads.\nPlease STOP your aggressive anti-city policies. You are causing a political storm for no legitimate reason. This is a stain on your reputation.\n"

        "comment": "I am both a cyclist and motorist in Toronto. As a cyclist, I am safer in a protected cycle track / bike lane. As a motorist, I am not worried about running over cyclists when they are in a protected bike lane. Bike lanes protect gig workers delivering our food. They protect families on their way to daycare and school. They protect thousands of people who choose to cycle because it is faster, healthier and more fun than sitting in a car or getting stuck on a broken down subway train. This overreach by the provincial government is rediculous. What works in Toronto might not work in Timmons, and vice versa. This is a huge province with very different needs across our communities. Ripping out bike lanes that were literally just installed is a sickening waste of time, money and materials. We can fix gridlock in other ways and keep the cycling infrastructure so we can reduce carbon emissions.\n"

If anything should be reduced it\u2019s the driving lanes.\nHorrible proposal that will lead to further deaths of cyclists due to drivers.\n"

        "comment": "I am disgusted by the misguided and misinformed effort of this government to regress the gains that our cities have been able to make in providing safe, environmentally friendly, and equitable alternative transportation solutions.\nIt is EXTREMELY well understood by those who care to do the research that adding more lanes to roads does NOT reduce traffic congestion, and that adding bike lanes and more alternative methods of transportation can in fact REDUCE congestion.\nThe idea that cities need to be built for cars instead of people is backwards thinking that I'm appalled we're even considering here in Canada.\nThat's also not even considering the environmental effects that induced demand of more motor vehicles brings.\nThis government is proposing making our cities noisier, more polluted, less safe and accessible to appease drivers. It's also important to note that estimates put the number of Ontarians without a drivers license at approximately 20-30%, a number which will be significantly higher in urban areas where alternative transportation is available. Alternative transportation that this government seeks to remove.\nIf the conservative government follows through with these plans to restrict or remove bike lanes, then it will be a damning indication of the lack of care for the current and future wellbeing of all Ontarians.\nI've provided links to a few different articles in the event that whomever reads this is in fact literate\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0967070X18301720\nhttps://www.wired.com/2014/06/wuwt-traffic-induced-demand/\nhttps://cyclingsolutions.info/cost-benefit-of-cycling-infrastructure/\n"

        "comment": "I am  writing to express my shock and disappointment at the decision to dismantle bike infrastructure across Ontario. This choice not only puts lives at risk but reflects a deeply troubling prioritization of culture wars and divisive rhetoric over the safety and well-being of Ontarians.\nBike infrastructure is not just for \u201ccyclists\u201d or \u201cdrivers\u201d; it\u2019s for all of us. The divisive framing that pits these groups against each other disregards the universal need for safe transportation options. As someone who lost a parent to an automobile accident at a young age, I know all too well the lasting impact these tragedies have on families and communities.\nThis is a step backward for Ontario. Dedicated bike lanes protect lives, support environmental goals, encourage healthier lifestyles, and boost our economy. Removing them prioritizes short-term political gain over the values and needs of our communities.\nI am appalled that our government has taken this path, and I cannot support leadership that disregards the welfare of its citizens for divisive ends. I urge you to reverse this decision and show true commitment to the safety and cohesion of Ontario.\n"

At the time he had subletted his room to a friend as he had moved back home to Burlington for the summer. I called him and he said that his friend had been riding his bike down Avenue Road the previous night and had been hit by a drunk driver.\nToronto is a city that is unfriendly to bikers and needs to provide proper infrastructure that allows bikers to travel across the city in a safe manner using bike lines. All my life I've been too scared to ride a bike in the streets of Toronto because I am afraid that I will get hit by a car. To rip up already existing bike lanes is a waste of money, and in fact more money should be spent on putting in new bike lanes and making the existing ones even better and safer for cyclists.\n"

        "comment": "There has never been a \"war on cars,\" because for the past century, it was more of a \"war on any method of transportation other than cars.\"\nThis bill wages a war on bycicle and urban infrastructure in a city that cannot afford to provide space to a car that carries on average one person.\nBecause when you count the people in the cars in downtown Toronto, and then count the pedestrians on the sidewalks, you'll find that almost always there are more pedestrians than people in cars. Despite that, most of the road space is reserved entirely for cars.\nThe City of Toronto found that bike volumes on Bloor Street of the downtown section matched car volumes, despite taking up less road space.\nRemoving the bike lanes is also bad for business. You're not at all likely to stop by a random store when you're driving down bloor in a car, but you're much more likely to when walking or on a bycicle. That's why so many business owners oppose the removal of bike lanes in Toronto.\nEven if bike lanes were removed, it wouldn't fix traffic. In 2013, bike lanes were removed on Jarvis Street. It became a five-lane road. It didn't fix traffic. In fact, it got worse. One could try and blame population growth for this (which is not true), but even if the worsening traffic was only due to population growth, it is ridiculous to suggest that because of population growth, we should continue to widen all our roads every year to meet the demand. It's impossible. It's like loosening your belt to fix obesity.\nWant to actually reduce gridlock and save us time? The only way to fix traffic is to provide viable alternatives to driving. Removing bike lanes will make traffic worse. It's been proven time and time again. Every single city planner already knows what this concept of Induced Demand is. That's because trains, buses, sidewalks, bike lanes, and trams could carry more people than any highway in Toronto.\n"

        "comment": "This Bill is being brought forth by the Minister of Transportation, a man whom apparently cannot envision any alternate method of transportation from his home (Brampton) to his workplace (Toronto). Meanwhile, at his disposal is the ability to drive to one of 3 GO Train stations near Brampton (with free parking) and taking the train into Toronto with the subway serving the remainder of the trip. This would avoid all traffic, congestion and is fully within his abilities to utilize. The fact that the Minister of Transportation is unaware of the transit options within his day to day life is worrisome.\nHe claims bike lanes are a significant source of said congestion but last checked Highway 401, 427 and the Gardiner Expressway which are the most likely options for someone from Brampton commuting into Toronto do not have, nor have ever had bike lanes installed on them, in fact the 401 remains the widest highway on the entire continent and yet suffers from some of the worst congestion on the continent.\nAdditionally this bill attempts to shoehorn in a motion to immediately remove bike lanes along specific roads in Toronto. Apparently the provincial government has such a glut of free time they would rather spend provincial resources to attend to municipal matters. Do I see a future where the provincial government now sits in on municipal committees to decide how many waste bins to place in parks?\nThe Provincial Government should be using fact based approaches to policy and investing in the future of the province as a whole. Not engaging in petty political grandstanding (in municipalities no less).\n"

Cars are causing gridlock. Toronto population has grown. Why take away the safe, efficient bike lanes which reduce congestion and pollution? Why not encourage people to ride bikes, for their health, for the small shops all along the routes and not to mention bike shops snd growing the local communities.\nConstruction is causing gridlock since drivers are forced to take alternate routes. Finish construction more promptly. Also, consider one full street such as Dundas to become only a bike route?\nDoug ford is wrong to create a bill to force his will and pro car agenda on everyone. He needs to learn to work together with people in towns and cities to determine how he can help us solve our issues as a community. A solution that does not privilege only drivers. We are HIS boss, not the other way around. Stop wasting our municipal taxes and human resources to do your bidding.\n"

It is unfair the the province is trying to override the ability for municipalities to make decisions that are in the best interest of the local population. Bike lanes indeed reduce congestion by removing car trips from he road, freeing up space for those who need car usage (Hamilton and Wichman 2018).
