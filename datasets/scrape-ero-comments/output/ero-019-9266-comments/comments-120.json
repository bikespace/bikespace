        "comment": "Doug Ford should stop trying to be the mayor of Toronto and work to fix the issues plaguing our province like health care and education.\nThis proposal is completely divorced from any studies or work around reducing congestion. Removing bike lanes from Toronto streets that took years to build will only serve to increase congestion. It seems to be driven by personal animus from the Premier as it does not reflect how the world actually works.\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nI am writing to strongly condemn the proposed plan to remove bike lanes from Toronto. There is, regretably, no basis for the proposed requirement for provincial approval of new bike lanes and the removal of existing ones. Decades of research has shown that bike lanes across the world improve the economy, hasten driving time, improve our health and wellbeing, and save lives.\nMoreover, bike lanes in Toronto have already shown tangible evidence of improving the lives of locals. Toronto Fire deputy chief Jim Jessop recently stated that since bike lanes were installed on Bloor Street, emergency response times have in fact improved. The proposed removal of bike lanes will harm emergency services and undoubtedly negatively impact people in moments of crisis.\nBike lanes also improve the flow of traffic. Although Bill 212 suggests that bike lanes cause congestion, the opposite is in fact true. Approximately half of all trips that people take are less than 2 kilometres meaning that by getting cars off the road for short trips, we can improve the flow of traffic considerably. The cause of congestion is not the amount of lanes we have for cars, but rather simply the number of cars on the road.\nI strongly urge you all to cancel this plan as it will cause more traffic, harm emergency services, and negatively impact local businesses who depend on foot traffic rather than car traffic to thrive. Other provinces, states, and jurisdictions are heading towards more bike and people-friendly cities, this plan will leave Toronto and indeed all of Ontario behind the rest of North America. Please reconsider before causing irreversible damage to the province.\n"

We should be adding bike lanes and public transit to combat gtidlock not cause more roadblocks for their creation.\nThe fact that bike lanes make it safer for bikers is good for everyone.  The traffic moves faster without the biker also in the regular traffic lane.\nAnother point if we want to increase traffic lanes would be to get rid of street parking on major streets.  That restricts the lanes and does not help traffic in the least.\n"

        "comment": "Has the city/province considered other reasons why gridlock occurs? Could we please take a look at how appalling the TTC has become to use? There are constant detours and delays, it is unreliable and slow. If more people were on bikes and/or the TTC, gridlock would be reduced. If parking rules were enforced and drivers did not feel they could simply stop and occupy a lane with hazard lights on (which happens regularly downtown on main arteries, for Uber drop offs and lazy arrogant people picking up food or people) then gridlock would be reduced. Promote GO transit, promote carpooling, and definitely, absolutely, install safe, clear and continuous bike lanes to encourage people to ride instead of drive. People want to ride their bikes but don\u2019t feel safe, I am one of them! Drivers in Toronto have become aggressive, reckless and do not obey the rules of the road. Vulnerable road users including pedestrians, are not comfortable navigating the downtown. Enforce safe driving! Ticket drivers for speeding, reckless driving, failure to stop, failure to signal. Bad drivers are the problem. Do not further encourage this behaviour by inflating the egos of drivers who feel they are entitled to do whatever they want. Listen to the people of Toronto, do not make this a place for commuters to abuse. Living downtown has become untenable, drivers are wreaking havoc and leaving downtown residents feeling anxious, attacked and unsafe. Do not pursue this bill.\n"

CONSTRUCTION WILL JUST CAUSE MORE CONGESTION AND WILL TAKE FOREVER LEAVING THE STREET AN ABSOLUTE MESS FOR YEARS.\nI AM 1000% AGAINST BIKE LANE REMOVAL AS A CAR OWNER AND CYCLIST.\nCARS CAUSE TRAFFIC. WHEN YOU ARE IN TRAFFIC YOU ARE TRAFFIC.\nIf the lanes are removed we will be left with one lane of traffic and then a bunch of cars (uber/delivery drivers) parked or standing in the right lane. When I'm on my bike I will purposely take the left lane and impede traffic because as a biker I\u2019m legally allowed to do that and there\u2019s literally nothing you can do about it.\nModern cities aren\u2019t car centric and Toronto is a modern city.\nThe ONLY way to reduce traffic is to give people safe alternatives. That is the ONLY way. Bike lanes are the CHEAPEST most effective way to achieve this.\nHey Doug, why don\u2019t you focus on finishing the Eglinton LRT. A kid born when that started construction is now in high school. Think about that. What an absolute catastrophe of a provincial project. And you want a tunnel under the 401? NEVER going to happen. Ripping up bike lanes as a response to your total incompetence and inability to get any viable transit projects done seems like the measure taken by someone still in diapers having a temper tantrum.\nGrow up.\nThanks,\n-West end home owner\n"

To impede this would be a step backwards.\n"

        "comment": "I'm absolutely in favour of the province putting a stop to additional bike lanes being added in cities at the cost of removing vehicle lanes.\nAs a cyclist, some of the recent bike lanes in Toronto are way under utilized.  As a result of traffic lanes being removed, vehicle traffic has moved from main street (Bloor st) to neighborhood side streets which are not designed to handle the volume of cars.  The increase traffic on neighborhood (residential roads) has lead to speeding, and increased risk to residents living in those neighborhoods.\nStreets such as Bloor st, which have a subway line already should not have bike lanes as there is ample way to move around. Same goes for other major streets which have street cars/bus lanes.  Bike lanes should be installed on secondary roads which are NOT serviced by pubic transit.\n"

        "comment": "I use the woodbine, danforth, bloor and sherbourne lanes on my daily commute to work (University Health Network) and feel more at ease having the lanes. Prior to the installation of lanes I'd have card swearving right and had many near misses getting hit, witnessed many cyclists getting hit so i completely disagree that any lanes should be removed and instead recommend that with careful planning more connections around the city be made to allow for safe cycling. If you build more lanes, more people will feel safe to bike and will leave their cars at home. Other major cities like Paris and NYC are becoming more bike friendly and reducing congestion by having more cyclist on the road so why would Toronto go backwards! There is no science or data to back up this notion that lanes create congestion, larger volume of cars instead create congestion. If cyclists stay in tjeir own lane, dont see how they would be the guilty ones creating congestion. Also if the city focused on adding cycle traffic lights or letting cyclist go when the pedestrian light turns green that would be a better solution to improve the flow of traffic.\n"

It appears to be either ideological, or just an electoral ploy to win over voters outside of Toronto at the cost of the well-being for people who ride bikes inside Toronto.\nI voted for the PC Party of Ontario to reduce the debt load and speed up housing construction, so far I have been dismayed by the micro-managing of municipal affairs such as bike lanes, and the weird fixation on alcohol laws like getting it into corner stores and bringing back paper bags.\n"

Several key questions remain unanswered:\n\u2022\tHow does the bill address the needs of the 65% of Torontonians who do not drive to work?\n\t\u2022\tWhy is there no provision for expanding or protecting bike lanes amidst construction, especially when cycling has become a vital mode of transport for many?\n\t\u2022\tWhat plans exist to ensure public transportation, which has been underfunded and deteriorating, will not suffer further due to the prioritization of highways?\nRecommendations:\n1.\tReallocate funds to public transit: Investing in TTC improvements and expanding bus and subway lines would benefit more residents, reduce congestion, and ensure equity for non-drivers.\n\t2.\tProtect active transit infrastructure: Ensure that bike lanes and pedestrian routes are enhanced, not neglected, during and after construction projects.\n\t3.\tFocus on long-term solutions: Address root causes of congestion through public and active transportation improvements rather than expanding highways, which risk encouraging more car use and urban sprawl.\nWithout considering these factors, the proposal feels hasty and one-sided, failing to serve the needs of all city residents.\n"

This bill is neither of those things.\nIf you want to improve traffic while being revenue positive you need to get some police to enforce traffic laws and issue tickets. Way too often there are other drivers who block the intersection and then no cars can get through when the light changes.\nGetting the gardiner fixed early would also be way more useful, even if university avenue was 10 lanes the gardiner is still the bottleneck at rush hour.\n"
