        "comment": "If you want to reduce gridlock you need to introduce alternate transportation methods OTHER than driving. By ripping out bike lanes it will result in further congestion. as a province and country we need to move away from suburban sprawl, and it's not a political statement it's an economic one. I am 24 years old and owning a car is a ridiculous economic burden. I grew up in an environment where you needed a car to get anywhere and it has serious social and cultural effects. Channels like not just bikes (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHZwOAIect4&t=974s) or Oh The Urbanity! (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FZDEehlaC4) have shown that is just backwards to dump time money and resources into car infrastructure. Toronto has been doing a fantastic job bringing some bike infrastructure to the standard that is seen in Europe, but if we rip these out we are right back where we started.\nPlease reconsider the decision to rip out bike lanes. You may not have to deal with the consequences but myself and my future children will.\n"

        "comment": "This is an indefensible piece of legislation, on multiple fronts.\nBuilding highways to reduce congestion has been proven time after time to fail. Paving over the Greenbelt has negative downstream impacts on existing infrastructure, the environment, and the food supply. Investing in regional rail, high-speed inter-city rail, and local communities can alter travel modes in more sustainable and desirable ways.\nBike lanes are an effective, sustainable intervention that encourages the active transportation of residents and visitors alike. Not only can it improve safety, reduce travel times, and clean up the city's air - it is also a cost-effective system (unlike car oriented roads, which carry far fewer people and need to be replaced far more often).\nBill 212 not only fails to achieve what it intends to do - it actually harms citizens, overrides local democratic structures, and costs far too much money. I understand that Doug Ford has little interest in courting citizens of Toronto or NDP or Liberal inclined voters - but this bill does not even adhere to the principles of conservatism.\nBurning money so Doug Ford doesn't have to see a bike on his drive to work is foolish and wasteful.\nPlease protect the farmers, the food supply, the commuters, the democratic system and respect the citizens, residents, visitors, and taxpayers of Ontario by voting against this bill.\n"

        "comment": "It is ridiculous that the province is even considering this bill. There is no justification for:\n- Adding additional red tape to cities who should be spending their time and effort addressing the housing crisis\n- Interfering with and micromanaging local city governments to this degree, and overruling the small-scale transportation decisions they are making on behalf of their constituents, whose needs and desires those local politicians are much closer to than the Premiere is\n- Wasting public money to rip up and repave valuable infrastructure, which is already in place and saving the lives of cyclists\n- Making life MORE difficult for drivers, by putting delivery cyclists and other bikes back into the flow of automotive traffic, which dramatically increases the risk of accidents for riders and drivers alike\nAdding more lanes for cars will not actually ease traffic (most city planners could explain the concept of induced demand for you), but tearing out key protected bike lanes from downtown Toronto will cripple the slowly building integrated bike-lane network which, over time, will actually reduce traffic by taking more cars off the road - the safer and more connected the bike lane network becomes, the more people will have the confidence to take advantage of it, making fewer car trips, and leaving more room for the remaining drivers. Case studies on European cities improving their cycling infrastructure show this.\nThank you, from an Ontario resident, homeowner and taxpayer.\n"

        "comment": "As someone who relies on the bike lanes in Toronto to be able to quickly move around the city while reducing my carbon footprint this bill is disgusting. It is a massive step backwards for sustainable living and development. We should be making a city as dense as Toronto a more walkable and bike able city for everyone. We should be looking at European cities as standards, where bikes are encouraged and accessible. People who cannot afford cars, gas, or who dislike driving downtown rely on bike lanes and public transportation. Removing bike lanes increases the chances of bikers being hit and makes biking much more dangerous. Bike lanes and bike infrastructure encourage an active lifestyle that everyone, ESPECIALLY the government should be encouraging. It\u2019s a sustainable and low cost way of living and this bill is a massive disappointment.\n"

        "comment": "This is an awful bill. I bike, I live just off Bloor. I don't regularly use cycling lanes, because\n1) they lack connectivity\n2) They are incomplete. The area right near my house, the lane is merged with car traffic.\nIf cycling lanes are underused, it's because they haven't been properly built and they don't connect to anything.\nThis is going in the complete wrong direction. Bike infrastructure is essential for a growing city. Prioritizing cars over everything else just leads to gridlock. Solving traffic congestion means pulling cars off the road. This will do the inverse.\nThe bill will also make the experience worse for me as a pedestrian.\n"

They in fact REDUCE car congestion as shown in several other cities around the world (Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Montreal, Portland Oregon) and increase the safety of citizens who commute and live in this city. Impending the construction of new bike lanes as well as removing pre-existing core bike lane infrastructure on Yonge, Bloor and University is a grave mistake and will heavily reduce my confidence in this provincial governments judgement in how they govern urban planning. I strongly urge this bill not to proceed.\n"

Instead, they are supposed to main streets that encourage local retail and activity. Removing bike lanes is a step in the wrong direction in 2024. Additionally, we don't expect the Government of Ontario to use their time focusing on this issue, this should be something that should be left to the city to decide on how they want to design streets.\n"

        "comment": "This bill should not be passed. Bike lanes actually help reduce congestion. More care lanes cause worse congestion. This is because it realizes latent demand. increasing car ridership. This latent demand also applies to bike lanes. And bikes physically take up less space than cars, making congestion better. This is why it is also dangerous to remove bike lanes. Cars are dangerous, especially for those not in one. Bikes operate at a speed that is more natural to human nature, unlike cars. This helps with reaction time and slower speeds cause less damage because they physically have less energy.\nAdditionally, this is lacking appropriate context. There is already meaningfully more car infrastructure than bike infrastructure. Car infrastructure is inherently more expensive than bike. It needs to accomodate large vehicles that are incredibly heavy and wear down roads , cause pollution both from tire wear and exhaust, harming many people even if you ignore accidents.\nBill 212 is also completely against our environmental goals and principles. We are already dealing with damages from environmental damage, we must not make it worse. This bill is reminscent of what Premier Doug Ford tried doing last year with the Greenbelt. Regardless of intent, only a select few would benefit while the vast majority, and even the government itself, would harmed.\n"

        "comment": "A reduction in bike lanes on a specific street must have an alternate route specified nearby with strong , appropriate signage to divert bikes from the affected street onto a safe, side street.  this has been done on many quiet, underutilized residential streets and promotes a safer enviroment for cycling.

Bowing to suburban SUV drivers will pollute the air & encourage boorish driving habits.

It is hard to believe that one can\u2019t see that a cyclist and the lanes to secure its safety are worth the money in every way.

        "comment": "This proposed bill is deeply disturbing to me as a cyclist, motorist, parent,\nand family doctor. Motorists should not have a monopoly on getting around. There are many families who cannot afford a car and they deserve a safe, affordable, and reliable means of transportation. Having protected bike lanes in a well-connected grid is how we get there. Even with our current bike infrastructure, Ontario cities are far from being safe or reliable for cyclists. And now our government is proposing regressive changes that would take us farther away from our goal. And it should be the goal of motorists, as well, because the more bike lanes get used, the fewer cars there are on the road contributing to congestion. Bike lanes also prevent unsafe cycling in the same lanes that cars use. This protects cyclists and motorists. I want my kids to be able to get around the city safely and I'm shocked the government is not on board with this vision. Lastly, cycling is leaps and bounds ahead of driving for one's health (in regards to physical activity, mental health, and pollution) and the more cycling is encouraged, the healthier we all will be.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes will not reduce \"gridlock traffic\", it will do the very opposite.\nCyclists will continue to use the same roads on their commute with or without bikes lanes. Without bike lanes, cars and bikes will have to share a single lane in an unsafe and unpredictable manner. More stopping, more yielding, more hesitation...more traffic.\nThis will also lead to cyclists finding an alternate  way to commute...more cars! More traffic. Not less.\nAlso...removing bike lanes doesn't provide an extra lane for cars. Bloor Street, as an example, is not wide enough. It will still be one lane of car traffic each way.\n"
