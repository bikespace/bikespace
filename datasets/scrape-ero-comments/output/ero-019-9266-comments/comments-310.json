        "comment": "This act is shameful. The Environmental Assessment Act is there for good reason. Making it null and void so the government can push through building this highway is extremely short sighted, much like a lot of Doug Ford's changes since his election. It is also clear that Ford does not like Toronto or the people within it> Removing bike lanes makes it unsafe for cyclists in the city. It would not reduce gridlock in any way. It will add more drivers to the road. The statistics are clear that a large number of people use the bikes lanes daily. Removing the safety of biking in the city, will reduce that number and increase the number of drivers instead.\n"

It allows us to be active as a family. In fact, I really cannot wait for construction to finish on the block between Jane and South Kingsway where there is no bike lane. The lack of bike lane makes it totally unsafe to bike to the Humber River trail with our kids.\nI am also a driver and I am opposed to removing the bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "As a person who has used bikes to get around since childhood this saddens me.  There were many times as a child and young adult that I had to make risky decisions while biking due to the lack of proper infrastructure. One of these leading to an injury due to confusion between myself on a bike, an   ebike and a car all crowded together at an intersection due to lack of proper separated bike lanes.\n  As a mother now to two young kids,the increase in better and safer separated biking infrastructure has given me hope.  Hope that my children will still have that freedom of movement around the community that I did but with less of the risks that I had to take.\n  This proposal to make safer infrastructure more difficult to add to a city, and even the removal of some of this is disheartening to say the least.  I am beyond upset at this proposal.\n"

We don't need the province to micromanage our cities. If the province wants to setup guidelines or minimum review periods/rules for putting in new infrastructure, I'm fine with that, but the province should not be reviewing the changes made to municipal managed roads unless they violate road safety laws.\n"

Decisions on infrastructure having to do with municipal roads, bicycle lanes and sidewalks should remain with the individual municipalities, duly elected municipal politicians, and citizens of those cities.\nFurther, removing bicycle lanes, without good data to back up any claim that they cause congestion is a waste of taxpayer dollars that will only serve to make streets less safe.  It also sends a message to our lower income residents that their safety and convenience are less important than that of those who own and choose to use a car.\n"

        "comment": "As a driver and as a pedestrian, I think that the amount of construction on Toronto\u2019s city streets contributes far more to congestion than bike lanes. In my experience, having clearly designated spaces for cars, bike lanes and parked cars increases predictability and communication among the drivers and cyclists, and therefore increases safety for both. I think that is important in areas with heavy traffic, such as downtown or along Bloor.\nI also think that bike lanes are even more important in areas with less traffic, because those cyclists need the protection of a designated lane. We all know how quickly a bike can appear out of nowhere, or easy it is for the cyclist to be in the driver\u2019s blind spot. Quantity should not be the only determinant; safety for both the cyclist and driver is more important.\nAs a pedestrian, I find it much easier to shop locally.\nI want to see more encouragement for using other modes of transport. Walking and cycling improve health and well-being, which benefits our healthcare system. They also have less impact on the environment, obviously. We need to continue to improve our public transport system.\nWe need fewer cars on the road, not more.\nMoreover, I think that the provincial government should allow the municipality to make these decisions.\n"

        "comment": "Besides being an egregious overstep by the provincial government, if implemented, removal of bike lanes will put lives at risk and as such is grossly irresponsible. The Government's responsibility is to ensure the safety of ALL residents of the province. All available evidence proves that bike lanes do not make traffic worse or negatively impact business, but they in fact do the opposite. The Annex BIA is in favor of the lanes on Bloor, and the Toronto Fire department has said there's been no negative impact to their response times on roads with bike lanes. The Government should be making evidence-based decisions, not ones made on personal feelings or anecdotes. The needs of all the residents of Toronto - regardless of their mode of transportation - should be considered, and safety should be the primary criterion by which decisions are made. The Government should spend their time and resources on improving transit and getting the existing projects on Eglinton and Finch completed and operational. The City of Toronto needs fewer cars on the road (especially in the downtown core and Lakeshore, getting on/off the Gardiner Expressway,) not more lanes, to get traffic moving. Eliminating on-street parking and illegal stopping on arterial roads would have an immediate impact on traffic flow.\n"

        "comment": "Premier Doug Ford doesn't understand that Toronto is now a global city and not the regional city he grew up in. Streets like Bloor can't be widened, and the population will continue to grow. Both Ford and Toronto residents must \"grow up\" and realize that only a maniac drives their car in Manhattan during the working day.   Same must apply to Toronto as we continue to grow --- the vast majority must get out of their cars to get around or as the city continues to grow it will grind to a halt. City residents must be encouraged to find another way of getting around.  So building bikes lanes and then encouraging everyone to give them a try is an excellent approach to getting ready for the future.\nI am an example of this. Since I moved to Toronto from the suburbs and I have been overjoyed to discover safe, protected bike lanes here. I never road my bike in the suburbs because it was too dangerous.  I have started riding my bike here and found some bike lanes are great (Bloor) and some are not so great (Royal York) based on safety.\nSince I started riding my bike I have lost weight and have more stamina.  I won't be the burden on the health system I would have been if I had stayed in the car-dependent suburbs.  Doug Ford, the health budget is the biggest part of your budget. You are late in your tenure as Premier and it's time to think about decisions that will determine your legacy. Stay in your lane, focus on the budget you are supposed to control which is health.  Get on your bike, ride the Bloor bike lane and set an example for people who don't use bike lanes and don't live a healthy lifestyle.\n"

I think the province has overstepped their bounds. Locally elected councillors can decide about bike lanes in their ward. Someone from Thunder Bay shouldn\u2019t have a say on my local bike lanes. The province can help traffic by being effective at the areas they control: finishing new transit options like the Eglinton line and getting police to enforce traffic laws (how many tickets have TPS given out for blocking the box.)\n"

        "comment": "Finally a voice of reason on this matter! All of the people involved in the planning and installation of the bike lanes on Bloor in west Toronto should step down over this project. What an abhorrent waste of tax payer dollars.\nThey are rarely used except by motorcyclists, mopeds, e-bikes and e-scooters. They cause horrible gridlock, impede fire/police/ambulance trucks and create safety issues for those with mobility issues trying to park on Bloor. They\u2019ve negatively impacted businesses along Bloor AND they\u2019ve made it extremely confusing and dangerous for drivers to even see those using the dedicated lanes, when turning right onto any side street. Not to mention the diverted vehicle traffic onto side streets in the area, most of which have no sidewalks south of Bloor. So now you have frustrated drivers, racing through streets and sharing the road with children.\nThese bike lines were built right on top of a subway! This makes zero logical sense. If someone wants to use Bloor Street for their travel and they DON\u2019T have a car or want to use a car, there is a subway system that was already built for this very purpose right below the bike lanes!\n"

They also are kind to our climate, boost small businesses, and help traffic flow better.\nAs an Ontarian, I support keeping the current bike lanes on Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue - and I strongly urge Premier Ford and his government to continue to let the city of Toronto keep their authority in determining the approval process for bike lanes.\nAs a driver, bike lanes allow me to feel safe when passing a cyclist and ensuring that I do not get stuck behind them. As a cyclist, bike lanes protect me from drivers and allow me to cycle to my location without impacting a driver. Ultimately, we need more bike lanes - not less.\n"

The solution to congestion is to improve public transportation such that more people would choose it over driving. A good start would be to complete the Eglinton LRT which is massively over budget and behind schedule. I really wish your Government would focus on that and leave the city to manage city traffic.\n"
