What a cowardly way to do that. ( I know many governments have done it but guess what often they get caught and people find out. Then it doesn\u2019t make the political party look good.)\nWill you be hiding the full car major inspection system you have in development in an omnibus bill also so people won\u2019t know that a major cost is coming soon? How come this isn\u2019t being announced before the next election call?\n"

        "comment": "This proposed legislation is both anti-freedom and anti-small business, two things that the current provincial government claim to be in favour of. The people who actually live in areas with bike lanes have voted in their municipal elections to have these implemented, it is not the place of the province to overreach and tell municipalities how to design their cities. This is especially absurd coming from a premier who constantly complains about the federal government overreaching its authority. This proposal is also extremely short-sighted. Bike lanes provide a space outside of vehicular lanes for bikes to prevent car-bicycle interactions. Removing them will introduce more bicycles in vehicle lanes, slowing down traffic. Moving bike lanes to other streets is not a solution to this problem as people will continue to bike to their destinations, not to a random street nearby.\nI also want to mention that time and time again that cycle lane development is good for businesses, especially small businesses. I will link reports with further information below. The PCs claim that the province is \u201copen for business\u201d yet is working tirelessly to make things harder on struggling small businesses. To any small business owners out there reading this, understand that any politician supporting this legislation is trying to sell you out to the Walmarts and Loblaws of the world.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes is a horrible idea. It will endanger the lives of cyclists who are very vulnerable travelers. The only way to reduce gridlock in Toronto is to reduce the amount of cars on the road. If everyone drove their car to work you could never add enough lanes to accommodate the amount of traffic and parking that would create.\nAdding bike lanes also has a huge economical impact. There are studies that have been done in Amsterdam that show that for every dollar spent on bike lanes, there are eight dollars saved for other items such as healthcare spending because people who cycle are healthier. Driving cars is a sedentary activity, which is especially horrible for office workers who spend all of their day sitting. I am an office worker and I greatly look forward to commuting by bike because it makes me active, which improves my mental and physical health greatly.\n"

This is an excellent way to make driving even more expensive for those of us who actually need to drive into the city. More lanes will encourage people who are local to toronto to just drive all the time and that will slow me down (i drive in from scarborough).\nThis is just poor oversight on the province's part. Did you not learn anything from the highway widenings??? More people in cars = slower cars.\n"

Toronto's traffic problems stem from the slow pace of road repair taking place across the city, including the partial closure of the Gardiner Expressway. Focus on speeding up these repairs, instead of wasting time and effort removing valuable bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "We all know that the development of car infrastructure proportional to population growth is simply an unsustainable model. We have seen how Ontario has one of the largest highway systems in the world, yet the GTA is still one of the worst to drive in. It is then not only a need but a priority for all citizens of the province for attention to shift to bettering other forms of transportation infrastructure to make way for people on the road. i.e. if you want less gridlock, let people have a variety of transportation choices so that when they decide to drive they will be sharing the road with fewer people!\nWe also know that the provincial government's incursion on municipal governance has always, and will always continue to, increasingly bottleneck any capacity for improvement. There is just evidently a disconnect between bureaucratic processes and the local reality, and the farther up-the-chain of command we go the more true that remains. Focusing on bike lane removal is truly a way for the provincial government to distract people and hit an emotional cord within them, rather than actually propose and enact beneficial infrastructure for the province and the city. Bike lanes make our roads safer, and more accessible, and get more cars off the road for people who truly need the cars to use them.\n"

Using the bike lane controversy as a ploy to distract from the actual purpose of this bill is transparent and demeaning to the public.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is yet again just another tactic to try to appeal to drivers when this will only create more danger on our roadways. By removing bike lanes at a provincial level, there is no ability to really understand the local impacts that are being had as well as the patterns of travel that people make. People will continue to use bikes whether or not there are bike Lanes and by removing them all you are doing is making it more dangerous for the bikers as well as slower for the drivers. This should be left up to the municipality only or region, the province should have little input/concern over municipal or regional roads. Downtown cores should not be built for cars, period, but be an area primarily for pedestrians, transit, and cyclists.\n"

        "comment": "Almost every day, cyclists are injured, killed or endangered while trying to get to their work or home safely. Protected bike lanes make them (us) safer, reduce traffic congestion by reducing the number of cars in the road, and cycling has health and environmental benefits. Provide people with a safe environment in which to cycle and more will do so, further reducing traffic congestion for those who have to drive.\nBike lanes are municipal responsibility, and provincial overreach that appears to be focussed on Toronto ignores the rest of the province.\nIt should also be remembered that not everyone can or will drive. Cyclists are children, students, and workers who may not be able to afford a car or parking. Reducing safe spaces to cycle will disproportionately disadvantage certain parts of the population.\nIn summary, equity and safety issues need to be considered.\n"

Adding MORE red tape to get bike lanes approved will not only prevent fewer bike lanes from getting built, but it prioritizes single-occupancy vehicle use over any other mode of transport. When we are in a climate crisis, we need to be building out our cities with environmentally friendly infrastructure not making it more difficult to get done in the first place. A classic Doug Ford oversight.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my deep concern and strong opposition to the proposed removal of bike lanes in our community. This decision is not only an egregious waste of public funds but also a significant threat to public safety and the well-being of our city\u2019s residents. The removal of bike lanes would directly impact my willingness to support or vote for any elected officials involved in approving this project.\nBike lanes save lives, and this cannot be overstated. They provide a critical buffer between cyclists and motor vehicle traffic, reducing accidents, injuries, and fatalities. In addition to enhancing safety, bike lanes promote healthier, more sustainable transportation options, and encourage a more active lifestyle among residents. At a time when we are facing escalating healthcare costs due to sedentary lifestyles, encouraging cycling through safe infrastructure is a proactive approach to improving public health outcomes.\nFurthermore, bike lanes are crucial for the success of Just-In-Time (JIT) courier services, which are becoming increasingly vital to our local economy. With the rise of e-commerce, food delivery services, and other on-demand industries, bicycles are an efficient and environmentally friendly means of delivering goods, especially in congested downtown areas. Allowing cyclists to navigate safely in dedicated lanes makes economic sense. Forcing these couriers to ride in the same lanes as motor vehicles not only endangers their lives but also slows down delivery times, negatively impacting local businesses and the overall economy in ways that are difficult to measure.\nThe idea of removing bike lanes, particularly in urban areas where traffic congestion is a growing concern, is counterproductive. Cities around the world are embracing cycling infrastructure to alleviate traffic congestion, reduce carbon emissions, and enhance the quality of urban life. Why should Ontario move backward? Investing in bike lanes is an investment in a safer, cleaner, and more efficient future for our cities.\nAdditionally, removing bike lanes may discourage many individuals who rely on cycling as an affordable and eco-friendly mode of transportation. For many, especially lower-income individuals, cycling is a necessity, not a choice. Taking away safe cycling infrastructure risks marginalizing these people further by making their commutes dangerous and impractical. If we are truly committed to making our communities more inclusive and accessible, we must maintain, and indeed expand, our cycling infrastructure.\nI urge you to reconsider this decision and prioritize the long-term benefits of safe, accessible, and sustainable transportation options. Bike lanes are not a luxury; they are a necessity for a modern, efficient, and inclusive city. Removing them will have serious consequences, not just for the safety of our residents, but for our economy and the environment as well.\nThank you for your consideration. I hope to see a commitment to preserving and enhancing our bike lane infrastructure for the benefit of all Ontarians.\n"

And how bike lanes improve street front economic activity.\nThe provincial government should only be concerned with the 400 series highways, and not smaller municipal roads.\n"
