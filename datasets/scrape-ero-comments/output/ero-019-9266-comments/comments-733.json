        "comment": "The Province should not overstep on municipal democracy. City Councillors and the public have advocated for these bike lanes.\nBill 212 is so focused on moving drivers, but it seems it is at the cost of the lives of pedestrians, cyclists, and even drivers.\n2024 has been a record breaking year for cyclist deaths. As a parent of a young child and someone who does not own a car, I feel so vulnerable sharing the road with drivers especially knowing that being killed by a car while cycling is not a rare occurrence. Cyclists have died on Bloor St, Yonge Street, and University Avenue and investments in cycling infrastructure are a step in the right direction to get to Vision Zero - zero road fatalities. This bill is so insensitive to the vulnerability of cyclists. Cyclists are not a monolith of privileged people. We are people who cannot afford cars, people who want a faster mode of transport in congested areas, and children who deserve independence before they can get a driver's license.\nBill 212 is only considering the wealthy who live outside of central Toronto, and can afford to drive into Toronto and drive out again at the end of the day. Cities like Toronto are unique in the Province and have unique needs and requirements. While Toronto should be inviting to people who live outside of Toronto, it should also address the needs and safety concerns of residents of Toronto first. Torontonians need cycle lanes, wide sidewalks, and plentiful transit.\nHaving bike lanes also reduces congestion. Consider if every person on a bike switched to driving. That is more congestion even if there's an extra lane of traffic. Congestion is getting worse every year because the population is growing. More lanes is just going to bring more congestion. Common sense and decades of research realizes that road widening and building new roads creates induced demand. Perhaps there will be free mobility for a few months, but it's just going to create more demand and the Province will be right back where it started. Those billions of dollars spent building highways and removing bike lanes will be a waste.\nThe Province needs to think long term about congestion. If you rely on experts and people who understand traffic management and transportation, you would know that the only way you will build your way out of congestion is through investments in public transit and cycling infrastructure. The idea that highways and extra road lanes will reduce congestion is not backed by any evidence, and I thought we left those antiquated approaches to transportation planning in the 1950s.\nBill 212 is in no way democratic. MPPs are only listening to a select few in Conservative ridings and there is no demonstrated public support of this bill. The Province is overstepping democratic processes to advocate for cycling infrastructure in order to benefit drivers in Conservative ridings outside of Toronto. This is shameful.\n"

        "comment": "I urge all members of the Ontario Legislature to vote against this legislation. Bill 212 is an infringement on municipal jurisdiction. Ontario cities and towns are best equipped to deal with bicycle lanes in their communities. As well, this legislation is a huge step backwards in protecting the environment. With global warming, the Province of Ontario should be taking steps to encourage eco-friendly forms of transportation such as cycling, rather than encouraging more cars on our roads. This is also a safety issue. Protected bike lanes enhance safety for cyclists by reducing conflicts between bicycle and vehicular traffic. In terms of economics, it makes no sense to tear up bicycle lanes installed by the City of Toronto at a cost of millions of dollars. This is a waste of hard earned taxpayers' money.\nLet us move forward to make our cities and towns more pleasant places to move around, using less fossil fuels and improving the air quality. Bicycle lanes encourage cycling and reduce the number of cars on our roads and contribute to less traffic congestion.\nThank you for considering my comments.\n"

        "comment": "Please consider not removing the bike lanes in Toronto.\nNot only do they provide an efficient and SAFE way for use to travel across the city, but the costs to remove them are a waste of money.\nConsider upgrading public transportation infrastructure so that we can can get from A to B to C and home again safely and efficiently. While not adding unnecessary emissions to our environment, which will only render life more unpleasant and unpredictable. (High winds, poor air quality, increased accidents, and general unpleasantness.)\nAlso consider adding MORE bike lanes, not less. And enforcing speed limits for automobiles and e-devices (scooters, bikes, mopeds, etc.)\nBikes and bicycle riders are not the problem, just the unfair target.\nToronto should aim to be a world-class city, in line with cities such as New York City and Paris, not a city from the 1950s. We were even more forward-thinking in the early 1900s when bikes were first introduced.\nSources for your consideration:\nhttps://www.cbc.ca/news/science/bike-lanes-impacts-1.7358319\n"

        "comment": "This is truly shameful legislation. The fact that the province has chosen to spend taxes on such a regressive waste-of-time is maddening. I drive and cycle in the City - as a driver I feel unsafe driving around cyclists when there is no lane. As a cyclist if feel unsafe biking less than 1 foot away from motor vehicles. Given all the data we have around the impact of bike lanes on congestion the fact that this act chooses not to reference any of it raises alarms as to the capacity (or will) for this administration to make rational and well-informed decisions in the interest of serving Ontarians.\nFurther (and perhaps more importantly) the overreach of the Ontario government into this municipal matter is disturbing.\nLets address a few of the points noted specifically:\n\"Recognizes the need to build priority highways faster as our province grows in order to get people and goods out of gridlock and save drivers and businesses time and money.\"\n1. Great! What on Earth do faster highways have to do with bike lanes in downtown Toronto?\n\"Recognizes that accidents and lane closures can worsen traffic congestion and impact the quality of life of Ontarians.\"\n2. Indeed! Closing bike lanes will certainly lead to more accidents. I really look forward to additional lane closures as the provinces spends 48$ million de-constructing road infrastructure.\n\"Is speeding up the delivery of broadband projects that will connect people in all parts of Ontario, including rural areas, with reliable internet access.\"\n3. Lets fix traffic with broadband internet?\n\"Is building Highway 413, recognizing the importance of this highway to millions of drivers from across Ontario.\"\n4. See point 1.\nThis is a disgrace.\n"

        "comment": "Taking a municipal issue like bike lanes and making it a provincial issue is ridiculous. Cities conduct their own studies to implement safe bike lanes to increase non-car travel and improve road safety for everyone. Cyclists are not just hobbyists - people use bikes to get around the city quickly at low cost. Many cyclists don't own cars because of the enormous cost of car ownership. Wasting money on removing bike lanes that already reduce traffic (traffic is made up of cars) and increase local business is not fiscally conservative. Plus, this is overreaching government at a municipal level.\nAlso, this bill includes details about expanding highways.  More highways just increase more car/truck traffic as there is no other travel option made available. The government needs to stick to current environmental laws to protect the green space instead of tearing it up for more highways. I do not support any of this bill.\n"

        "comment": "I am cyclist in downtown Toronto. I use a multitude of cycle lanes including Simcoe, University, Bloor, Yonge. The removal of lanes or decrease in creating lanes will create even more traffic problems in the downtown area.  As I cycle I see who uses the major cycling lanes on University, Bloor, Youge, etc - people like myself for appointments, work, meetings, school, shopping; tourists on rental bikes; people with companies that use delivery bikes such as Uber and FedEx. I see a variety of bikes from electric, to cycling, larger bikes, scooters.\nWhere are we all going to go when our bike lane is removed? I suspect we'll still use Bloor, Yonge streets - I know I will.  But we'll be cycling in traffice! Is that what the proponents of Bill 212 want? Do they want workers, students, commuters, tourists cycling in car lanes and all the risks and traffic gridlock that will come with high use of bikes and other alternative travel competing with cars ... because of no bike lanes?  It would be a nightmare for people like myself, staff cycling to hospitals on University, students cycling to university and college, touists on rental bikes!\nIf you love this City, its citizens, and the environment, vote NO to Bill 212.\n"

We need to provide safe and effective alternatives to personal vehicles if we aim to reduce traffic and improve quality of life.

Also, studies have shown economic benefits to shops along roads with bicycle infrastructure.\nWe are in a climate crisis that comes with significant economic and health impacts.

        "comment": "Reject Bill 212 bike lane nonsense!\nI write to you to express my extreme disappointment, frustration and shock of the Provincial government to WASTE taxpayer dollars by meddling in local municipal issues with Bill 212\u2019s bike lane approvals and removals. You don\u2019t have the local knowledge to make these decisions. You are adding more red tape than Santa Clauses\u2019 workshop has for a lifetime!\nI was born and raised in Toronto and have lived in Etobicoke for more than 40 years. I walk, cycle and drive in the city. I have cycled on Toronto roads since the 90s, with and without bike lanes. I bike from Etobicoke to Downtown for work. I have had near misses with vehicles while cycling and walking, and felt that the \u201cMoving Ontarians Safely Act, 2023\u201d recognized the real risks to all road users and highlighted the care that everyone needs to take for one another. But unfortunately it is not enough. Pedestrians and cyclist continue to die on our roads from motor vehicles. The main roads cannot be used like a highway. Stay in your lane and leave the local roads to the locals.\nHave you cycled in Toronto? If not, I would encourage you to try it - on small and large roads, with and without bike lanes. I guarantee you will feel the real difference having a painted line, a few plastic bollards or a curb between you and a transport truck makes. We need the main roads to have bike lanes to cross major barriers, such as Hwy 401, rivers and creeks and railways. I challenge you to get from north Etobicoke to south Etobicoke, or along any east/west route, without riding on a main road. I have experienced many times when mapping a route to my destination, biking is quicker than transit or car. We need bike lanes for people to feel safe, and be safe, with this option and reduce the cars on the road. This is the local knowledge you do not have, thus should not be involved in making decisions on bike lanes.\nWhat is causing our gridlock? Have you looked at the population numbers? The constant overruling by the Province on Municipal zoning decisions, without proper consideration for supporting infrastructure, has pushed the population densities of our neighbourhoods beyond the infrastructure\u2019s capacity - thus gridlock. This is the mess it has made. Not to mention the non-stop development construction that closes and blocks lanes. We cannot travel the same way we did 50 years ago.  High speed rail connecting Ontario city centres - YES PLEASE! That should be your focus and that is where I want my tax dollars to go, instead of removing bike lanes under Bill 212 and wasting tax payers dollars.\nToronto does not have the room to make wider roads. Bike lanes move more people in less space. It is healthy (which is good for our health care system! You should focus on that) and reduces emissions (oh, that\u2019s good for our health and the environment and the future of our planet!). Bike lanes make our city more livable. Make solutions for our grandchildren\u2019s children that they will be proud of.\nYou say not everyone can cycle. Well, not everyone can afford a car, along with the insurance, maintenance and gas, plus parking. What good is affordable housing if people cannot move around in ways they want or need to.\nProgressive Conservatives? Ha! I say Prehistoric Conservatives. Bill 212 bike lane approval requirements is ridiculous red tape and removing existing bike lanes is taking us backwards! Focus on moving people throughout the Province. Let Toronto make decisions on planning approvals and local transportation. Don\u2019t make it worse for Torontonians. This is a clear attack on Toronto.\nStay in your lane, please. Reject Bill 212 bike lane approvals and removals and bring us high speed rail.\n"

Many Torontonians cannot afford a car or choose to bike because it is healthy and efficient, and this proposal actively endangers those lives. This proposal is aligned with the intrest of those wealthy enough to own a car, who come from outside the city and are just driving through. We should be working towards making the city more livable and healthy, with reliable transit infrastructure and encouraging Torontonians to walk and cycle as this is better for their health and the health of the planet. Cities are for people not cars!\n"
