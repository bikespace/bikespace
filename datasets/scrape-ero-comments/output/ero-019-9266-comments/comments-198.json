        "comment": "As a lifelong resident of Ontario, I'm disappointed to see this regulation being proposed. Additional vehicle lanes do not reduce gridlock, and historically lead to increased car usage. Bike lanes, in contrast, allow for safe and effective transportation for people of all ages. They increase business in an area in addition to enhancing quality of life. It is important to allow municipalities to make their own decisions about bike infrastructure, rather than creating more red tape at a provincial level. This regulation is bad for the environment, for businesses, and for the residents of Ontario.\n"

The current situation is making the city unlivable for residents and unenjoyable for visitors. The focus should be on major improvements to public transit and further development of bicycle friendly infrastructure. Toronto is outrageously congested; it is beyond a joke now and will only get worse if a bill such as this is implemented.\n"

        "comment": "Dear MTO,\nI live in Toronto and I am deeply concerned with this proposed legislation.\nBike lanes have been proven to benefit the society in multiple ways:\n1. Increased road safety for ALL road users.\n2. Increased public health.\n3. Reduced emissions.\n4. Increased sales locally.\n5. Increased land value.\n6.  Reduced inequality as bike ownership is much more accessible than car ownership.\nWhat toronto needs is more bike lanes that are built at a better standard (protected bike lanes), not another restriction.\nIf the government wants to reduce gridlock, building more highways and adding lanes will not solve the problem long term. The only solution is providing viable alternatives to driving. This means expanding and improving public transportation, adding efficient and rapid railway connections that would allow people to get to their destinations without using a car.\n"

        "comment": "This is needless bureaucracy and not in line with modern city planning. Bike lanes reduce traffic, which is why it makes sense to remove lanes for them sometimes. The city should be responsible for this as they know which roads have what amount of traffic vs. cyclists. Southern Ontario has too much car-only infrastructure already... just look at how awful Toronto is for everyone (drivers, pedestrians, transit riders, and cyclists...) due to the ridiculous amount of cars on the road. This is due to lack of transit and cycling options for the large population (and lack of well-planned highways that connect to or avoid downtown as well). Adding or preserving car lanes does not fix these problems and only makes congestion worse.\n"

They are looking after their residents, the very people who navigate the roads on a daily basis, and the very people who find the maintenance of municipal roads through their tax dollars.\nThis bill is directed solely at Toronto, and only serves the individuals who commute via car, likely because they have no better option.\nBike lanes serve to protect cyclists. Period. Removing bike lanes will result in more injuries and deaths. Besides, biking around Toronto is an incredibly efficient, healthy, and \u201cgreen\u201d way of navigating the city.\n"

As a vulnerable road user\u2014a cyclist and pedestrian\u2014the changes this bill proposes will make the streets of Toronto\u2014large and small\u2014more difficult and more dangerous for me. I do not own a car or drive. Cycling, walking, and public transit are my primary modes of transportation for leisure, shopping, and commuting. Improved cycling infrastructure such as the bike lanes on Bloor Street have directly improved my quality of life, my mobility, and my safety. In my immediate neighbourhood, the recently adopted Wallace Emerson Neighbourhood Streets Plan\u2014developed to address the appalling safety issues in our community\u2014includes proposals for critical interventions at dangerous road intersections on arterial roads in the plan area to address the needs of vulnerable road users such as seniors, school children, and people walking and cycling. It's a complex plan supported by extensive research and community consultation, and this bill would negatively impact this plans important work, remove the agency of the plan's authors and the community it serves, and all without any concern for the negative outcomes of this decision: diminished quality of life for vulnerable road users, their mobility, and a continued or even increased risk of injury and death for all. We need more bike lanes and complete streets infrastructure\u2014not less\u2014and municipalities should have jurisdiction over what infrastructure is best for their community, not the provincial government. Thank you.\n"

        "comment": "This project is a gross misuse of public funds. We should absolutely not be wasting money to remove existing, useful infrastructure (bike lanes on Yonge, Bloor, and University).\nThere is also absolutely no reason for the province to have a say over municipal bike lanes, that doesn't make sense and is a complete overreach. Municipalities are best placed to determine where bike lanes should go.\nBuilding any city for cars is a backwards step. Building more roads doesn't solve the congestion problem created by cars, it just encourages more people to be in their cars and adds to the congestion. We need to be investing in alternatives like bikes and public transit, to allow people to get out of their cars and reduce congestion on the roads. People feel like they have to drive because they don't feel comfortable biking or taking transit. So make biking and transit appealing options by improving these services! It's so obvious.\nThis bill makes absolutely no sense, is a complete waste of money and has no evidence backing it. More cars is not the answer.\n"

This is going to do the opposite of what is intended. Cities that have invested in strong cycling infrastructure often see reduced congestion, improved public health, and higher experienced quality of life. This bill will reverse all of that.\n"

London has made some progress recently with creating infrastructure for me, my husband, and my son to get around the city on our bikes, safely. I can't imagine how we would get around the city without them. London's main roads are built for speed, and people constantly exceed the speed limit. It would be reckless and dangerous for us to be on the roads outside of our neighbourhood with our son. What would we do without bike lanes? Riding on the sidewalk is illegal. What options would exist for a family like mine? Would we have to get a car to add to the congestion and pollution of our city?\n"

        "comment": "I am against downtown Toronto requiring provincial approval for the addition of bike lanes and for provincial regulations that discourages maintaining and growing Toronto\u2019s bike lane network. Toronto benefits from people having an alternative to traditional roads for cars, as it is much faster for me to commute around the city on a bike. Furthermore, bike lanes create opportunities for healthy (and convenient) life styles for Torontoians through facilitating exercise into the daily commute and reducing smog. Also, a potential shift towards fewer bike lanes, as would be enabled through provincial oversight if bike lanes weren\u2019t aligned with the political values of the provincial government, would create a great traffic and parking problem in most areas of Toronto. There already isn\u2019t enough parking infrastructure and many of the people who live here don\u2019t have or use cars as a result. By making travelling around Toronto less accessible for the people who live here, it makes it harder for the people who must drive in to compete with local traffic. Please keep the decisions on local issues in local hands and do not invite provincial oversight on bike lanes in Toronto.\n"

Toronto has an elected council that can make decisions on their own roads.

I am 64 years old, and I although I agree that construction and heavy use of Toronto roads BY THOSE COMMUNITING FROM OUTSIDE OF TORONTO can make driving frustrating, I absolutely do NOT want to see the province get involved in the approval of bike lanes in our city.  Torontonians deserve to make these decisions ourselves via our elected city council representatives.  As an older female trying to do more of my work transit and errands via bicycle, I very much rely on the existence of bike lanes to keep me safe on our busy roads.  If bike lanes were removed, or made less convenient, this would only discourage people like me from cycling and send us back into our cars, and pray tell, how would THAT reduce traffic congestion?  I would much rather see our provincial government take care of its current commitments to improving public transit in Toronto (get the Eglinton Crosstown open, for example) so that more people who currently using their cars will be encouraged to leave the car at home and take public transit.\n"

The government of Ontario should be forward-thinking and actively working to mitigate the effects of climate change. In terms of transportation, this would include encouraging the use of alternate modes of transport such as cycling, and focusing on improving public transport. Instead, the government is wasting public funds for the benefit of a few stakeholders. This bill is not evidence-based and will not address gridlock. Research shows that bike lanes ease congestion, reduce emissions and are a benefit to businesses. Cyclists deserve a safe and reliable way to commute. A car-centric society increases the cost of living, contributes to climate change, and is not universally accessible. Public policy should not be created on the whims of politicians, but be evidence-based and be focused on what the public actually needs and wants.\n"
