        "comment": "I think the provincial government's proposal to introduce a bill which not only limits the construction of new bike lanes but also threatens to remove existing ones is an absurd overreach of power. These kinds of decisions should be left to cities. Not only that, the premise upon which the bill is based is nonsensical. Removing bike lanes will not solve gridlock - the only way to do that is to remove cars from the road, and create alternate ways for people to move around the city. Biking is one way of doing this, and the safer we make bike infrastructure the more people will feel comfortable adopting this as a way of commuting. The city has seen a huge increase in the number of people and drivers in the last decade, and we won't be able to able to solve this issue by building ever more lanes. As traffic engineers are well aware, \"induced demand\" will always be a problem - the more lanes you build, the more people will decide to drive. Building bike lanes, on the other hand, is a hugely efficient way of moving people around, and it has a host of environmental benefits. Removing cars from the road removes the pollution they create, which results in cleaner air and fewer greenhouse gas emissions. Also, car tires are a huge source of microplastics from their tires. And cars also wear out our roads faster (by several orders of magnitude) than bicycles do, because of the huge difference in mass between cars and bikes. I think that if this bill is passed it will have negative consequences for the environment, our infrastructure, and ultimately the safety of road users.\n"

        "comment": "I bike to work in Toronto every day. I cannot take the TTC because it will double my commute time. If you remove the bike lanes, I will then only commute by car. I have a family. I won't risk my safety by biking in the streets without protected lanes, and biking only on side streets increases my commute time too much to make any sense.\nSo it'd have to be car commuting for me, which will both increase congestion and cost me a lot of money for gas and parking. My household only has 1 car, and there's even a chance we'd have to buy a 2nd one in order to accommodate my needs and my partner's, which would be even more ridiculously expensive. I am positive I'm not the only person this will happen too.\n"

        "comment": "I am not in favour of Bill 212 insofar as it pertains to bike lanes. Municipalities should have the autonomy to design and implement cycling infrastructure as they are best positioned to understand local needs, traffic patterns, and community input. Imposing provincial oversight risks undermining these efforts, potentially causing delays and preventing municipalities from quickly responding to local demands for bike infrastructure.\nBike lanes are critical components of sustainable urban mobility, and municipalities must retain the ability to develop them efficiently. The Province should prioritize enhancing public transportation and implementing congestion charges to reduce the number of cars on the road, rather than focusing on measures that facilitate increased car use. A shift towards active and public transportation aligns with broader goals of reducing gridlock and emissions while enhancing the quality of life in our communities.\nI urge the government to reconsider this approach and allow municipalities the flexibility needed to expand cycling infrastructure without unnecessary bureaucratic barriers.\n"

Road infrastructure within a municipality should be the responsibility of that municipality. Requiring provincial approval for something like bike lanes, or allowing for the province to remove bike lanes is a ridiculous overreach. Municipalities should have that authority, regardless of what any given MP or minister thinks as they contribute to the ongoing problem of congestion by choosing to drive in the city of Toronto.\nThis naked pandering for votes will have life and death consequences for road users while doing less than nothing to reduce traffic.\n"

        "comment": "In the Government\u2019s proposal, it claims its new bike lane regulations would \u201cfight gridlock and get drivers where they need to go faster.\u201d In fact, studies from around the world as well as from here in Canada and Ontario have shown repeatedly that adding bike lanes \u2013 even when they remove vehicle lanes \u2013 leads to equal or reduced traffic congestion as people feel safer biking to their destinations instead of travelling by car. This leaves more room for the remaining drivers, delivery trucks etc to get around, reducing their travel times. Conversely, adding vehicle lanes almost always creates more congestion, as it invites more people to consider driving instead of using other modes of transportation such as public transit or active transportation. (There may be initial reductions in congestion when vehicle lanes are added but they are wiped out and often exceeded after a few years). Based on the abundant and accepted science on this matter, I urge you to reconsider this proposal and instead embrace building more bike lanes in order to ease congestion, reduce environmental impacts such as fossil fuel and air pollution, and improve overall population health through better air quality and improved access to active transportation facilities.\nIn the preamble to this proposal, the Government claims it \u201crecognizes the need to build priority highways faster as our province grows in order to get people and goods out of gridlock and save drivers and businesses time and money.\u201d In fact, for similar reasons stated above, building more or wider highways is not the most efficient or cost-effective way to move people and goods around the province. Investments in public and active transit such as commuter rail, LRT, bus-only transitways, high-speed rail and bike infrastructure generally cost less than investments in building or widening major highways and roads. Yet these public and active infrastructure investments can vastly improve gridlock on our existing roads and highways while also helping the province hit its carbon emissions targets, reduce other forms of air pollution, improve public health and ultimately lessen the burden on our struggling healthcare system through improved overall health. This is exceptional bang for your tax buck! With this in mind, I urge the Government to take a more science-backed look at its strategy for \u201creducing gridlock, saving you time,\u201d as so far the policy seems to simply \u201cmaintain the status quo yet cost you more tax dollars.\u201d\nFinally, the Government proposes that as part of this new regulation municipalities \u201cwould be required to seek provincial approval to allow for the implementation of new bicycle lanes (\u201cbike lanes\u201d) that require the removal of an existing lane of traffic.\u201d This is yet another example of this Government\u2019s systematic undoing of municipal autonomy as it seeks to impose its political platform across the province. Many municipalities in this province are led by councils elected on progressive platforms, which include support for increased bike lanes, better public transit options, reduced reliance on private vehicles and commitment to mitigating the impacts of climate change. Voters have elected these councils to implement their vision, and are asking councils to move forward with these positive changes in their communities. The Government\u2019s attempt to interfere with local municipal decision-making is political overreach at best and undemocratic at worst. This particular proposal on bike lanes villainizes both municipal planners and cyclists, and appears to be a dog-whistle policy aimed at that most unpleasant minority of drivers who think it\u2019s funny to honk at cyclists, throw their take-out cups at them or squeeze them off the road.\nReducing gridlock is a worthy goal and can have many trickle-down benefits, including reduced carbon emissions, improved air quality, improved population health and more equitable transit connectivity. However, the Government\u2019s current approach of adding and widening highways and restricting the construction of bike lanes will miss the opportunity to take advantage of these trickle-down benefits, ultimately costing Ontarians in the form of poorer public health, future infrastructure deficits and irreparable environmental damage. I urge the Government to reconsider its approach to focus more on active and public transit options in order to maximize our tax dollars and build a better Ontario for all.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing in opposition to the proposed amendments to the Highway Traffic Act related to bike lane approvals.\nThe proposed amendments that would require municipalities to seek minister's approval for new bike lanes is redundant and unnecessary. The Environmental Assessment Act and Municipal Class Environmental Assessment process already establishes a framework for assessing potential impacts from infrastructure projects such as the redesign of roads. There is also already a process for \"bumping up\" Municipal Class EAs for provincial review if members of the public feel that a municipality has not followed the process correctly or has not appropriately considered impacts.\nThe effect of the proposed amendment will be to create a barrier to the implementation of bike lanes in dense urban areas where the public right of way is already primarily occupied by motor vehicle lanes. This places an unfair and unequal burden on dense municipalities with narrow rights of way compared to lower density municipalities with wider rights of way and is counter-productive considering the denser municipalities are in a better position to encourage cycling due to the shorter distances between destinations.\nThe proposed amendments to the Highway Traffic Act are also inconsistent with the recently enacted Provincial Planning Statement, 2024 and will frustrate the province's efforts to achieve the objectives of the Provincial Planning Statement.\nSection 2.2 of the Provincial Planning Statement states, \"1. Planning authorities shall provide for an appropriate range and mix of housing options and densities  to meet projected needs of current and future residents of the  regional market area  by:  c) promoting densities for new housing which efficiently use land, resources, infrastructure  and public service facilities, and support the use of active\ntransportation\"\nThe proposed amendments to the Highway Traffic Act contradict this direction in the new PPS but adding an administrative layer to the installation of new bike lanes to serve new residential development that supports the use of active transportation. The proposed amendments will have the effect of discouraging municipalities from repurposing existing motor vehicle lanes, even in areas that have surplus capacity.\nSection 2.3.1 of the Provincial Planning Statement states, \"2. Land use patterns within settlement areas should be based on densities and a mix of land uses which:  c) support active transportation\"\nThe proposed amendments to the Highway Traffic Act would have the effect of discouraging active transportation by adding an administrative layer to the repurposing of motor vehicle lanes for bicycle lanes. The proposed amendment will frustrate the province's objective of ensuring settlement areas support active transportation, especially in established settlement areas where the public right of way is not wide enough to accommodate new bike leans without repurposing old motor vehicle lanes.\nSection 2.4.2 of the Provincial Planning Statement, 2024 includes provisions for the intensification of development around Major Transit Station Areas. This intensification cannot proceed on the basis that primary mode of transportation outside of the transit system is by motor vehicle. Bicycles and public transit go hand in hand. Including bicycle lanes in close proximity to transit stations provides an important \"last mile\" connection between the transit station and people's homes, jobs or other destinations. Existing Major Transit Stations are often located in denser, urban areas where the majority of the public right of way is already occupied by motor vehicle lanes, without additional space available to accommodate bike lanes without repurposing the motor vehicle lanes.\nIn the absence of bicycle lanes, residents in intensified Major Transit Station Areas are more likely to drive, which will result in more traffic and gridlock. If they are provided with safe space to bike, this will reduce the traffic impacts of new development. Implementing barriers to the repurposing of motor vehicle lanes to bike lanes will frustrate the province's objective of achieving greater intensification in Major Transit Station Areas.\nSection 2.9 of the Provincial Planning Statement, 2024 states, \"1. Planning authorities shall plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prepare for the impacts of a changing climate  through approaches  that:  d) promote green infrastructure, low impact development, and active transportation,\nprotect  the environment and improve air quality.\"\nBicycle lanes promote active transportation. Prioritizing the retention of motor vehicle lanes over their repurpose as bicycle lanes, and requiring an extra bureaucratic step of obtain minister's approval, directly contradicts the direction of the PPS, 2024 and will negatively affect the Province's objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\nReducing reliance on motor vehicles supports the PPS objective of improving air quality by reducing vehicle emissions and micro-particles related to rubber tire wear and brake pad wear which make their way into air and water.\nSection 3.2 of the Provincial Planning Statement, 2024 states, \"1. Transportation systems should be provided which are safe, energy efficient, facilitate the movement of people and goods, are appropriate to address  projected needs, and support the use of zero- and low- emission vehicles.\"\nBicycle lanes improve the safety of roads for all users. They reduce the frequency and severity of collisions involving motor vehicles, bicycles and pedestrians.\nBicycle Lanes are energy efficient by encouraging human powered transportation options instead of fossil fuel and electrically powered vehicles that require significant resources to build, transport and operate.\nBicycle Lanes facilitate the movement of people and goods, often with greater efficiency than motor vehicle lanes because of bicycles smaller size and greater maneuverability. Delivery companies have begun shifting to cargo bikes for deliveries and food couriers on bicycles have proliferated greater in recent years.\nBicycle lanes are particularly appropriate to address the projected needs of large and growing municipalities like Toronto, Mississauga, Brampton, Ottawa, Vaughan and elsewhere.\nBicycles are zero-emission vehicles.\nAny legislation that would have the effect of slowing down the installation of bicycle lanes by requiring minister approval, especially if the criteria for the minister's approval is not clearly stated, would be contrary to the direction of the PPS, 2024.\nPrioritizing motor vehicle lanes over the installation of bicycle lanes by requiring minister's approval of any bike lanes that would repurpose vehicle lanes is contrary to the direction of the PPS, 2024.\nSection 3.2 also states, \"3. As part of a multimodal transportation system, connectivity within and among transportation systems  and modes should be  planned for,  maintained  and, where possible,  improved,  including  connections which cross jurisdictional  boundaries. \"\nBicycle lanes are an important part of a multi-modal transportation system. The proposed amendments to the Highway Traffic Act do not establish any standards, criteria, or methodology that the minister would use to evaluate proposed bicycle lanes. This makes planning for a multi-modal transportation system difficult or impossible because planning authority will not be able to anticipate how the minister will determine if their proposed bicycle lanes will be evaluated.\nThe Province of Ontario already has an established set of guidelines for the design of bicycle lanes in its Ontario Traffic Manual Book 18, and we already have an established process for evaluating the impacts of infrastructure projects through the Environmental Assessment Act.\nSection 3.9 of the Provincial Planning Statement states, \"1. Healthy, active, and inclusive communities should be promoted by: a) planning public streets, spaces and facilities to be safe, meet the needs of persons of all ages and abilities, including  pedestrians, foster social interaction and  facilitate\nactive transportation and community connectivity.\"\nBike lanes provide safe facilities for active transportation.\nOverall, the PPS does not state that active transportation should be subordinate to motor vehicle transportation. Read as a whole, the PPS provide clear direction that the Province of Ontario intends to prioritize active transportation, densities that will not function if the priority is motor vehicles, and a comprehensive response to climate change.\nThe proposed amendments to the Highway Traffic Act are not consistent with the Provincial Planning Statement and will in fact frustrate the implementation of the PPS. The proposed amendments are redundant and unnecessary considering existing requirements under the Environmental Assessment Act, and the proposed amendments do not provide any direction on how the minister intends to evaluate bike lane proposals or any methodology for determining the impacts of removing motor vehicle lanes.\nFor these reasons I am opposed to Bill 212 and the provisions related to bike lanes should be removed.\n"

        "comment": "There are three things I'm concerned about with this bill:\n1) First and foremost, I think it will cause more deaths and injury to cyclists. Without protected space, cyclists are open to traffic of all kinds which will absolutely increase cyclists casualties. Part of Ford's thinking is that cyclists can bike on smaller streets but a cyclist's destination or leaving point might be on a bigger street. How do you get to Yonge and Dundas square, for example, without going on Yonge or Dundas?\n2) I believe this will increase traffic collisions too, as cyclists will have to integrate with vehicle traffic. The thing that slows down traffic is unpredictable roads and drivers having to make decisions on the fly. Of course that's part of driving but instead of a driver trying to get around a detour, they're trying to go alongside a cyclist is who physically vulnerable but also having to make decisions on the fly since they're on the road too. This will make traffic stop and go, increasing congestion and accidents.\n3) I just don't think the province should be meddling in municipal affairs like this. For a Conservative government, this is a Big Government move. There's the meddling part, but then there's also the expense the province will need to expend to review new proposed bike lanes. That money could be better spent, or put towards the deficit. Toronto telling Sarnia or Thunder Bay or Petawawa what to do with their main streets seems like an overreach of government.\nI implore the government to back away from this bill. I believe, over time, it will be a liability to the provincial Conservatives reputation. No time will be saved for drivers, congestion will be worse, more people will be killed and all because the province wanted to dictate what happens in people's communities.\n"

Modernized TTC vehicles, GOTrains and ViaRail, actual timely and working infrastructure that can allow people to commute across the province and around the GTA. We should be investing in high speed rail and 10-15 minutes GOTrains. You should be allocation funding to municipalities for these projects.\nTorotonians have a right to enjoy their democracy and experience the legislation they voted for by the councillors they voted in. It's absolutely ridiculous the steps the premier has taken to encroach on Toronto's autonomy and jurisdiction. Bike lanes are necessary parts of our public infrastructure. To remove them is a wasteful and politically motivated decision. One especially biting when you consider what other legislative priorities should be funded in lieu of their removal. Cyclists are members of our society and deserve every bit the protection that these lanes create. From cutting the size of city council, strong mayor powers, Ontario place, the science centre and now bike lanes, it's clear to constituents that the premier has nothing but contempt and a gross misunderstanding of his powers when it comes to Toronto. If the legislature doesn't understand that it's not their place to dictate municipal policies, then they should resign and go work for the cities. Otherwise, they need to step off and remember the constitutional breakdown of jurisdictional responsibility. Residents will remember that when every facet of our social, public and economic infrastructure is crumbling under privatization and abandonment, that the province chose to use tax payer money to remove bike lanes.\n"
