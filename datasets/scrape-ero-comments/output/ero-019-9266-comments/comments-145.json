        "comment": "Bikes are an inexpensive and environmentally-friendly alternative to vehicles.\nIf Doug Ford really wants to help people save money (and on an aside, no, his proposed one-time $200 rebate is not going to change people's lives -- it would be better spent supporting public transport, education or health care), bike lanes need to stay, even along main roadways in Toronto.\nCars have dominated the transportation scene for far too long.\nToronto residents want safe and efficient alternatives to cars. For those who car commute from the suburbs to Toronto, especially in 1 passenger cars -- take public transport -- subways and GO trains are great opportunities to destress after work while reading, resting or catching up on the latest shows.\nBefore taking away and reducing the number of bake lanes the government must start focusing more on the main causes of car gridlock:\n1. A commitment to increased yearly TTC funding to increase the number of trains, street cars and buses for more efficient and less crowded public transport\n2. Crack down on people who continue to park in no stopping/no parking zones during peak rush hour times (a primary cause of gridlock in the city)\n3. Crack down on people who weave in and out of lanes, who in the end cause more delayed traffic\n4. Crack down on e-bike, scooter and small motor-bike riders who travel at high speeds, often above the speed limit, and dart in and out of traffic and bike lanes\nThe current proposed Parklawn bike lanes with the addition of CAR turning lanes, along with police ENFORCEMENT of illegal parked/stopped cars and speeding, will assist in improving traffic flow and improving safety for people using all modes of transportation.\nI am a 50+ year old who walks, bikes, takes public transport and drives a car. We ALL need to respect one another's decisions about modes of transportation. No one group should be afforded the power to limit the choices of others. If someone chooses to drive over the other options, then they need to understand their commute may take a little bit longer. Those who walk, ride or use public transport know they need to allow extra time for their commute too. No one person is more important than the next person.\nSo, NO, I do not support BILL 212.\n"

As both a driver and a cyclist, I care much more about the safety of our cyclists than any miniscule increase in road space. Just recently a cyclist was crushed to death by a dump truck due to lanes being blocked. Causing even more risk of death and injury is unacceptable.\n"

        "comment": "Two glaring issues with Bill 212.\n1. Schedule 3 section 2.\nHighway 413 should not be exempt from the environmental assessment act. A poll by Ekos in December 2021 showed 49% of respondents were against highway 413 with only 29% in support of it.\nThe globe and mail reported on May 27, 2022 that highway 413 would have a negative impact on the environment. Exempting highway 413 from the environmental assessment act would be purposefully hiding the negative environmental impact highway 413 will cause.\n2. Schedule 4\nThe provincial government is infringing on municipal jurisdiction by requiring the ministry's approval on bike lanes as well as allowing the ministry to remove existing bike lanes. This is not within the provincial government's jurisdiction and should be left up to the municipalities. The provincial government must recognize where its jurisdiction starts and stops.\n"

Do not spend any money removing existing and paid for infrastructure, especially if it will not make any tangible difference in congestion. It is lunacy that that even needs to be said. We are in the midst of a healthcare crisis, the Eglinton LRT is still not open, why not do something about that instead?\nI also strongly oppose any attempt to expand highways into the Greenbelt..the blatant cronyism and corruption for this project is unbelievable..\n"

A great way to help with congestion is finishing transit projects that the government of Ontario is in fact responsible for, rather than meddling in municipal affairs. This is an attack on the city of Toronto and an overreach by the province. This will lead to deaths of cyclists and there will be blood on the hands of the government of Ontario. Let Toronto decide what is best for the city, focusing on data and not car-centred rhetoric. Focus on provincial led projects.\n"

        "comment": "The proposal to interfere with municipal decisions about bike lanes is a terrible idea. Bike lanes are approved by city councils that are democratically elected - if the population didn't want them, they would elect different councillors and mayors. As well, bike lanes are essential for intensifying central Toronto. While many new condos and apartments are being built, there's no room for any more cars in central Toronto. Instead, new buildings are providing bike parking so that people use bicycles INSTEAD of cars. If all of those people are made to drive, Toronto's terrible congestion will only get worse, whether or not am extra curb lane in provided.\nAs well, most of the bike lanes are replacing curb lanes that were used for parking most of the day. During rush hours, when they were supposed to be open, they were rarely used for through traffic because they were blocked by people turning right, or by people making illegal short stops. The only use was for sometimes high-speed dangerous passing on the right, but cars in those lanes always had to merge back eventually, which only made congestion worse. I know this because I have been both a driver and a cyclist on some of the streets targeted for bike lane removal, before the bike lanes were installed and after.  They are now safer and faster to use as a cyclist, and no slower as a driver but definitely safer. All that's required to maintain existing travel speeds is to make sure there are turn lanes at intersections, which the city has been systematic in providing.\nPlease abandon this terrible idea - it is a waste of provincial time and resources, and can only make things worse. The whole point of municipal governments is they have a better idea of local needs than a remote provincial government.\n"

        "comment": "It feels like the Ontario government wants to focus on making life easier for drivers, when other places in the world with world-class cities are moving in the direction of fewer cars, better public transportation, and better walkability.   If anything, this feels like a deliberate move to push Ontario cities (Toronto in particular) in the other direction.  This feels like a deliberate lowering of quality of life.\nWhy isn't the Ontario government working on out-of-the-box solutions to the problem of gridlock?  We have an opportunity here to be nimble and forward-thinking.  There are so many possibilities for new ideas that could really change the lives of people in Ontario for the better.  Why isn't the government working harder to be truly innovative?  Positing the removal of bike lanes as the be-all and end-all solution to gridlock and car traffic is dull and regressive.\nThe plan to prevent new bike lanes and review / remove existing ones feels really short-sighted.  There's no future planning here.  There only seems to be money spent on removing pre-existing infrastructure for the sake of a grudge against city dwellers and cyclists.  What's the Ontario government going to do if the gridlock isn't solved by the removal of bike lanes in municipalities?\n"

Because of this, making it harder to implement bike lanes is a mistake. How will this fix the gridlock traffic on the major highway system? It won't! You know what could help? Encouraging less use of cars. Make it easier and more affordable for folks to use transit and bikes. Do this and car lanes will not be so backed up and everyone will get places faster but also SAFER.\nRemoving bike lanes won't fix grid lock, it will only serve to kill cyclists! I beg you to reconsider this bill.\nThank you for your consideration.\nKim\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is one of the most ill-conceived ideas I've heard of in a long time.\nMore bikes on the road mean fewer cars, which means less traffic and less congestion.  Think to yourself: What are some of the most congested roads in Ontario?  Answer: the 400-series highways where they pass through cities, the Don Valley Parkway and the Gardiner Expressway.  Are there any bike lanes on those roads?  Nope.\nAdding more car lanes does not reduce traffic.  It causes something called induced demand; within months of new car lanes being added, congestion levels typically return to exactly what they were prior to the new lanes being added.\nIf Ontario were serious about reducing traffic congestion, it would spend money on non-car infrastructure such as (much) better public transit and better cycling infrastructure.  This has been proven to work in cities around the world from Japan to Europe.  Adding more car infrastructure or reducing bike infrastructure is completely counter-productive and is a total waste of tax dollars.\n"
