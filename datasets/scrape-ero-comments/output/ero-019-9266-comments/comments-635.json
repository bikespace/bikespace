        "comment": "Removing bike lanes is only going to further increase the dangers of cycling without the safety of the lanes.  Will taking back bike lanes alleviate traffic congestion with any kind of significance? This is a bandage solution to a problem that requires a body bag.\n Removal of bike lanes by the Mayor of Toronto only goes to show he could care a less about the safety of cyclists and promotes car culture to the full extent. Auto traffic is not a new problem and its not going\n to get better until you offer a way of public transport outside of automotive.\n"

This bill is against any action that I see as progressive and favorable to a sustainable, high-living standard, place to live. It would also regress the actions taken by forward looking municipalities and government leaders in the past five years. As a resident of Ontario, I'm ashamed of the leadership the current administration is showcasing and I'm not in favour of their approach.\n"

        "comment": "Dear Governmental types...\nSadly the Toronto city government has created bike lanes on major roadways instead of secondary parallel roads over the past five years.  Yes, use secondary roads that run parallel to major roadways instead of major roads like Yonge, Avenue, Bloor east and west, etc.   How many people do I hear now who say they will never go downtown (Toronto) because of the messed up traffic, 'snarls' as some call them.  How much revenue is downtown Toronto missing out on from people who live outside that centre and beyond into the greater Toronto area (GTA) because SO many people don't want to fight the traffic?  A LOT.\nAnd the same goes for potential bike lanes in Etobicoke, North York and Scarborough.... use roads that parallel major streets and don't foul up their commutes also.\nConcerned Toronto Citizen for 40 years.\n"

        "comment": "Dear Mr. Ford,\nAs a driver, not a cyclist, on busy Toronto streets, I strongly support bike lanes, and just as strongly oppose this new attempt by the Province to limit or remove them. My experience with them is that they do not increase my travel time. Instead, I know where to expect bicycles on busy roadways, and don\u2019t have to constantly watch for them directly in my path. I also want to know that my daughter and son can ride safely, as they travel to and from work along Bloor St.\nWhat if it was your daughter that was not returning home because you removed a bike lane? What would you say to the driver who didn\u2019t see her? Six dead cyclists in Toronto already this year is six too many.\nThe provincial government should not go forward with this backward step for safety.\n"

        "comment": "Regarding Bill 212, I use the bike lanes in Toronto, and I want the bike lanes to be preserved and expanded. I have seen a large increase in the use of the bike lanes, and the use of the bixi rental bikes. Trips taken by bicycle remove traffic from our streets, and I think removing bike lanes would actually increase traffic congestion. Cities may be creatures of the Province, but I feel that decisions on bike lanes are best taken with local input. If a city decides to create bike lanes the Province should respect this local decision.\n"

Bike lanes lessen gridlock.\nWhen I lived in Toronto and the Bloor St. lanes first went in there were days when there were more bikes than cars using the road.\nMunicipalities are the experts on knowing how best to structure their roadways for the best outcomes for their residents and visitors. The Province should stay out of this entirely.\n"

To solve congestion we need fewer cars on theroad, which need a combination of (i) road tolls, (ii) more buses and bus lanes, (iii) more streetcars and LRTs, (iv) more subways, (v) more commuter rail, and (vi) yes, more bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are a necessary part of transit infrastructure. I do agree that keeping bike lanes on less busy roads is ideal and moving forward that should be a priority. But to rip out what has already been put into place seems wasteful and will only hurt the progress that's been made - this year bike sharing was the largest growing alternate way (to cars) that people got around the city of Toronto. They expect to get 6 million rides this year, more than any year before, Why? Because driving is not only too slow but it's too expensive for most, and transit has become overcrowded and unreliable with all the cutbacks. Bike share is astoundingly affordable and flexible. Though I don't do it myself I think it's great so many people are doing this. But they do need safer ways to ride around the city and that means bike lanes. We have to shift away from car-only thinking, because it will only lead to worse congestion.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes is going back backwards.\n2 things happen when you remove bike lanes:\n1) bikes ride with cars on the road, slowing traffic as car move safely beside them. Or they don\u2019t and accidents occur.\n2) bikes ride on the sidewalk to feel safe. Which makes it dangerous to pedestrians. Especially with the increase of electric bikes and scooters that often do not have speed limits.\nBike lanes save lives.\nBike lanes make driving in the city safer.\nWithout safe places to bike, some people will resort to driving.

        "comment": "What a disgraceful piece of legislation. Even the name of the bill is propaganda. Not everybody in Ontario drives a car. Some people are medically unable to drive. Such individuals may be able to ride a bike or walk. You will just making life harder for people who ride bicycles for transportation to work. school, shopping or medical appointments. Worse, I feel you will make the roads less safe for cyclists, who as it is have to deal with verbal abuse and inattentive behaviour from entitled drivers. This bill gives the false impression that cyclists are responsible for traffic (they are not) and cyclists don't belong on the road (we pay taxes for the roads like everyone else). If this bill is passed, traffic will only get worse as people will drive instead of cycling if they are afraid of increased road rage. All signs are this government cares nothing about the environment and health, but if they did, they would encourage cycling. And I would like this provincial government to NOT be a nanny state -- stop dictating what roads should look like in my neighbourhood, in the city where I pay property taxes.\nWhat a waste of time and money. Why can't you do your jobs by focussing on things people need, like health care, education and a clean environment. How dare you say that you are saving me time, when emergency rooms are crowded and infrastructure is crumbling. Seriously, how dare you.\nBy the way, I own a car and drive a car, and frequently drive someone to medical appointments, so there is no need to dismiss me as some kind of Birckenstock-wearing, latte-swilling radical cyclist. I ride a bike when I can, and car commuters ought to appreciate when there is one less car on the road.\n"

If there is a bike lane, more people will choose to ride bikes; if there is no bike lane, people who would have otherwise biked might choose to drive instead, putting more cars on the road. More car lanes cause more cars. More cars cause more congestion. Less cars cause less congestion. Bike lanes cause more bikes. More bikes means less cars. We need more bike lanes, not fewer.\n"

I owned a small business at Jarvis and Adelaide for 35 years, up until this past February.  For most of those years I  biked to work and love the oxygen hit in the morning to get the day started and the ride home to pump out  stress from the day.  If we want a healthier population, get them out of cars and onto bikes, like many forward thinking jurisdictions in the world.\nWhen the bike lanes went in on Adelaide and Richmond, we noticed a surge in clients biking to our business and the biggest complaint was too few places for people to lock their bikes.\nDoug Ford is showing the world he also is a politician with a mind trapped in the past.  If he was serious about gridlock, he would fire everyone at METROLINX and end the embarrassment that is the Eglinton Crosstown and leave our bike lanes alone.\n"

        "comment": "The proposed legislation appears to promote the use of automobiles as a primary means of transportation to the potential detriment of others modes such as cycling.  As a driver and cyclist it is my opinion that cyclists need a dedicated lane on busier roads for cyclist's safety and for the safe sharing of roads between these two modes of transport.\nReplacing  bike lanes with automative lane as proposed will force motorists and cyclists to share the same lanes, which may increase the risk of collision with cyclists, who are much more vulnerable.  Furthermore sharing these lanes with cyclists may force cars to slow down which appears to be counter to the stated goal of reducing gridlock and reduced environmental impact.\nI am curious on which studies and recommendations this proposed legislation is based upon?  Has any consideration been made that replacing bike lanes with auto lanes may increase congestion by encouraging more automobiles to use the roads?\nI am also concerned the province is attempting to increase it's jurisdiction over municipalities which may have a better understanding of their traffic patterns and characteristics and have appropriate solutions to reduce traffic congestion while balancing the needs of various modes of transport.\n"

Outsiders, such as Doug Ford, come with their SUV and other polluting cars. They rush in and out of our town, paying no attention to our life nor our health, so that, by the end of the day, they can return fast to their little places of paradise. They are not interested in our voice/wellbeing; they only want to collect our taxes and use our buildings. It is not important to them if cyclists and pedestrians are getting killed by their cars on our streets, and if our air is polluted. At the end of the day, they will rush back to their far-away suburbs where they want trees and birds, and to have pleasurable Bar-B-Qs because, Oh!, they so much like their green world. Let us have our trees and birds as well. Please preserve our health and our lives. Do not touch at our bike lanes.\nThere is so much work to be done to fight the climate problems of (today and) tomorrow. This is where investments should be made. Not in the destruction of bike lanes. Think about all our grand-children and what type of world we want to build for them.\n"
