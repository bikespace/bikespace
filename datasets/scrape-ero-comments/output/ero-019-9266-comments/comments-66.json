        "comment": "This is an extremely regressive and uninformed policy. Requiring provincial oversight into bike lanes is an overreach of the provincial government's authority and increases red tape for municipalities that know what is best for their communities. We know that bike lanes do not lead to increased congestion or vehicular traffic, and actually have the opposite effect. Increasing safety and accessibility of active transportation gives people more options to get around, reduces CO2 emissions, and improves overall quality of life. The Bloor BIA supports the Bloor bike lanes and has seen improvements to business since their installation. Removing bike lanes is a waste of money and will lead to more cars on the roads as well as more accidents and deaths which are completely preventable. I suggest the premier reads some scientific articles looking at this effect and puts his personal feelings aside.\n"

Removing bike lines is sanctioning the deaths of more cyclists.\nRoads are for everyone, not just cars.\n"

        "comment": "This legislation is short sighted and does not have studies and data supporting the identified goals. Municipalities provide bike lanes and remove vehicle lanes where studies and demands have deemed them necessary for the safety of their active transportation commuters who require affordable modes of transportation or opted for low environmental impact modes of transportation (which in turn reduce congestion because they are not contributing to the congestion by choosing to cycle between destinations).\nProvincial approval authority for the installation of new bike lanes on municipal roads is the province overstepping municipal mandates.\nHere is an example of how bike lanes are a more effective use of space:\nReviewing a meter of complete street (St that has a road, a dedicated bike lane and side walk), over the course of on hour thee can be 1000-2000 mixed traffic vehicles, 7500 cyclists, and 9000 pedestrians. By removing the bike lane we ae either forcing those 7000 cyclists into vehicles or on the road on their bikes; both of which increases congestion. Taking half the cyclists does not accommodate double the road capacity. (3000 cyclists>2000 mixed use vehicles).\nAdditionally in increase in vehicle traffic is an increased maintenance cost on roads and highways. The more people you can get taking alternative modes of transit decreases wear and tear on roads and extends the lifespan of existing infrastructure.\nI took 2 classes in university on transportation as a Civil Engineer; and one of the first things they teach you is that increased lanes does nor decrease congestion. It is clear that that this proposed Bill is not based on studies, engineering or lessons learned from cities of western society.\nPlease consult experts when providing supporting documents; provide examples of best practices that have seen success and stop pandering to more drivers and provide reasonable afterlives such as rail, alternative cycling routes, buses, car sharing, & electric scooters and stop micromanaging municipalities that have already done all the studies, stakeholder consultations and tendering of services.\n"

        "comment": "This is an incredibly backward, short-sighted move and an incredible waste of time and resources. It will not alleviate congestion but instead generate new demand as cyclists are forced off the roads. Alternatively, you'll have cyclists in traffic - are you going to ban that as well? This will increase the number of accidents and inevitably result in the death of another cyclist. This bill is mindbogglingly stupid and arrogant. You know how you reduce gridlock? You make it more convenient and safe for people to get around town using methods that reduce the overall footprint. Cars are the least efficient method. This doesn't even touch on the fact that cycling infrastructure reduces emissions and increases community wellbeing. But, obviously, the government doesn't care about any of this as they are clueless about governing.\n"

I live in Ottawa, I highly doubt that Ministry staff know this city better than my local city councillors and mayor. I have not seen the evidence that this bill will improve traffic. It will just cause bikers to bike in the middle of the car lane instead of their own lane, which will make traffic worse. Even if the bike lanes are an issue in Toronto, then the bill should only be applied to Toronto; there is no need to add red tape to everyone else. It's hard enough to get bike lanes built in Ottawa -  I asked for one near my house and the city said it will be built \"soon\" in 2025. The Ministry located in Toronto could not adequately assess bike lanes for a city 5 hours away.\n"

If bike lanes are removed, those cyclists would be forced to use their cars instead, adding more vehicles to the roads and increasing traffic congestion.\nIts also very well studied and observed that increasing the capacity of a road actually increases congestion in the long term by 20% compared to the control. This is called \"induced traffic\".\nThe provincial government has stated in the past that they did not want to dictate urban planning for municipalities when it comes to zoning, however hypocritically wants to spend tax payer dollars by adding red tape to processes dictating when and where a municipality can implement biking infrastructure\n"

The fact is, studies consistently show that bike lanes reduce traffic congestion by promoting cycling over driving, thereby taking cars off the road. In cities across North America, including Toronto, research has demonstrated that bike lanes lead to fewer vehicle miles traveled and make streets safer for everyone.\nThe idea that bike lanes cause traffic is simply outdated. When you look at the data, it's evident that well-designed cycling infrastructure doesn't create problems\u2014it solves them by improving traffic flow and reducing collisions. So rather than clinging to knee-jerk reactions, let's focus on what the facts and research tell us: bike lanes are a smart investment in Ontario's future.\n"

We're going to work, we're going to shop, we're trying to live our lives and doing it without creating extra traffic congestion. You know what creates congestion? Cars! And every cyclist on the road is one less car. If you don't like bikes in bike lanes, you're going to like it even less when we're taking up the full lane, which is exactly how we rode when there weren't any bike lanes (I'm old enough to remember that). We'll do it again if you take the lanes away.\nThis is blatant political pandering and no one is fooling anyone.\n"

        "comment": "I have a difficult time processing that this is the grand solution the provincial government is proposing to fix gridlock.  I live in the City of Toronto and commute to Mississauga for work every day.  Between congestion and traffic due to a crumbling infrastructure that was not meant to support the number of people settling in the GTA, what should be a 15-20 commute can take up to double that.  There are so many construction projects on my route, that it is an unbearable process.  I physically feel anger and stress the whole way there and back.  But, I have no alternatives at this time because taking public transit would take me over an hour and I do not feel comfortable riding a bike due to the infrastructure not being there for me to do this safely.  Bike lanes are not the problem - they are the solution.  That, along with creating more public transit and incentivizing having fewer cars on the road.\nI remember when the bike lanes along Bloor first opened about 10 years ago - what a delight!  I am not the most confident cyclist, but knowing that there was a safe place for me to ride my bike meant that I could rely on that mode of transportation to get me around the city.  A revelation!  With so many stories about cyclists being killed by motorists, knowing there are dedicated bike lanes for cyclists to use gives me confidence to ride my bike around in those areas.  And that means ONE LESS CAR ON THE ROAD.\nBike lanes do not increase response times to emergencies, per the Deputy Fire Chief of the Toronto Fire Department.  It has actually been studied and documented that taking street parking out and replacing it with bike lanes can improve business, so the argument that it impedes business seems patently false.  Additionally, in 2023 more than 5.7 million trips were made on Bike Share bicycles in the city, which correlates with my anecdotal evidence of feeling safer on the roads with more bike lanes.\nProviding more cycling infrastructure is also a more equitable system - it takes the pressure off people of lower income who may not be able to afford a bike and who are reliant on public transit to get places.  As I stated, my options to take public transit to work are unteneble, and I am sure there are others out there in similar positions who would benefit from having the option to ride a bike safely to work.\nIn a world where we are trying to reduce our carbon emissions and our eco footprint, should we not be encouraging people to take more sustainable transit options?  Bikes are not only a wonderful form of active transit, they are super sustainable, and other than the upfront costs and the occasional maintenance, there is no additional expenses in terms of powering a battery (unless it is an e-bike/e-scooter) or filling a tank.  There is no concerns of fare dodgers.\nConversely, spending more tax-payer money to rip up bike lanes that were only recently installed seems like a poor use of money.  Adding more lanes on roads has been shown to not alleviate congestion, and really tends to result in more cars on roadways.  More cars on roads means more wear and tear on our infrastructure and more stress and frustration, which in turn leads to accidents.  This is not an answer to the problem.\nInstead of wasting money trying to solve a problem outside of the Provincial governement's purvue, why not try to address the horrendous conditions in our healthcare system?  Or perhaps fund our education system more appropriately?  As an education worker, I see every day how the underfunding at our schools takes a toll on both the students and staff.  Between the lack of resources and the increasing needs of our student population, we are being worked to the point of burnout, and our students are falling through the cracks and suffering.  It would be really great if the Province would focus more of their attention on these two things within their jurisdiction instead of trying to trample on the municipalities who are acting on behalf of their unique populations who live across the whole province and not just in the GTA.\nThank you for your time.\n"

        "comment": "These are my concerns regarding the proposed framework that would grant the provincial government approval authority for the installation of new bike lanes on municipal roads, especially when it involves the removal of bike lanes.\nFirstly, adding more car lanes has historically not solved congestion problems. In many cases, it leads to a phenomenon known as \"induced demand,\" where increased road capacity encourages more people to drive, eventually leading back to the same levels of congestion. Investing in alternative transportation options like bike lanes can actually reduce traffic by providing residents with viable alternatives to driving. This is supported by multiple studies such as https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.101.6.2616\nSecondly, decisions about local infrastructure are best made at the municipal level. Municipal governments have a closer understanding of their community's needs and are better positioned to make decisions that reflect local priorities. Centralizing this authority at the provincial level may overlook the unique characteristics and requirements of individual communities like Toronto.\nI believe that maintaining municipal control over the installation of bike lanes is essential to make sure we have an effective transportation planning. I urge you to make evidence-based decisions and reconsider this framework while supporting local autonomy in these matters.\n"
