        "comment": "Hello,\nI am writing to formally OPPOSE your proposed Bill 212 amendment titled \"Framework for bike lanes that require removal of a traffic lane.\" There is no reputable published data that shows removing existing bike lanes including those specifically called out in this amendment will have any impact on reducing \"gridlock\" as you put it. If you took the time to speak to any experts in this field, you would know the Toronto streets are so over capacity that simply removing these bike lanes will not achieve your goal. It's just going to spread it to more of the roadway. It's like trying to put out a grease fire with water...you're only making things worse.\nAll data shows the way to remove gridlock to is REDUCE THE DEPENDENCE ON MOTORIZED VEHICLES, not encourage it. Removing these bike lanes (or any other lanes, or preventing more from being built) will only exasperate the problem you are trying to fix. Further, by removing an affordable method of travel in major cities, you are further worsening the quality of life of marginalized individuals who cannot afford to own or use their own vehicles.\nResearch clearly shows there is no statistically significant difference in motorized vehicle speeds during rush hour when a bicycle is present vs. when it's not. Specifically \"bicycles do not reduce passenger car speeds by more than 1 mph (1.6 km/h) at most locations\" (see reference provided). Is saving 1.6 km/h really worth the cost to taxpayers of this Act? I certainly hope Doug will provide that justification when he announces this act is passed, although I'm not going to hold my breath on him taking any responsibility for the cost to taxpayers.\nMoreover, removing these lanes will only further reduce the safety of cyclists. To be clear, people will die as a direct result of this amendment. Doug Ford will be responsible, but will he take that blame and responsibility? Previous actions suggest likely not, but I'll leave that up to him to be an adult.\nIt is abundantly clear this act is simply Doug Ford forcing his will and power because he and his pals want to. It is not based on any facts or data. Look no further than Doug's own comment that \"1 cyclist\" passed through a bike lane on Bloor street over the entire day vs. the actual bike counter that is installed on that path.\nWe live in a democracy. Doug Ford does not have dictatorship powers and should not be enacting laws based solely on what those who pay for votes tell Doug to do.\n"

        "comment": "I\u2019m a resident in Toronto who has lived in the downtown for nearly 10 years. It took 8 years for me to begin cycling in the city. Doing so, has made me witness the city and appreciate its often overlooked beauty. I am so proud of the bike lanes I ride in everyday, some of which have become the highlight of my day. Seeing them be improved like College and Bloor, bring such a sense of joy to my day. I love seeing people utilizing the accessibility these lanes offer us by taking their kids to school, commuting to work, deliver your food and packages, and doing their daily exercise. Removing essential bike lanes from College, Bloor, Yonge, and University would be such a loss to the city, and a slap in the face to the all the people who dedicated their careers to getting these installed. As someone who uses these lanes everyday to get to school, shop locally, pet sit for my clients, and visit friends, it astounds me to hear that elected officials who drive into the city once a month to see a Jays game, can make such fiscally irresponsible and uneducated decisions involving municipal matters. The city should not need the province\u2019s approval to install new bike lanes. The existing bike lanes should absolutely not be removed, for the sake of traffic, safety, tourism, and climate crisis mitigation. The provincial government needs to focus on not failing in their response to the affordable housing crisis rather than distracting suburban voters with unrelated non-issues.\n"

        "comment": "The Ontario government has committed to reducing red tape; Bill 212 is a direct contradiction of this commitment. Excessive government oversight, such as requiring provincial approval for new bike lanes, is not to be taken lightly, as there is no guarantee that the government is consistently and completely accountable for the consequences of its decisions; this is especially notable in matters that have been traditionally addressed at the municipal level. I strongly agree that traffic congestion is a burden on all Ontarians and that bold, strategic actions must be taken to reduce gridlock, but removing existing bike lanes, let alone infringing on the municipalities' autonomy in the process of doing so, is not going to reduce gridlock as intended, especially in the long-term, but will create further problems that are completely avoidable. There are countless, costly examples here in Ontario where adding lanes for motor vehicles did not effectively reduce gridlock in the long-term; seriously improving alternative options to driving is a more effective strategy, still to the drivers' benefit: more free capacity for those who choose to drive or have to drive. I am not necessarily advocating for a bike-centric approach to urban planning, but I am especially wary of taxpayer dollars being used to remove a bike lane that could otherwise stay: congestion would not improve as desired for drivers, but those biking are now in further peril. Removing bike lanes will not eliminate the demand for biking: those biking will now be forced to mix with motor vehicle traffic, which is only more frustrating for drivers stuck behind bikes and far more dangerous for those biking. It is no secret that drivers in Ontario have become more aggressive, especially when faced with more challenging environments such as the presence of bikes impeding traffic. Separating bike and motor vehicle traffic purely for the safety of both drivers and bikers already has significant merit: removing bike lanes through provincial mandates is only going to implicate the province in serious injuries and fatalities as a result of the removal of bike lanes when the province could've otherwise not removed the bike lanes and reduced the congestion through far more effective means.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is an outrageous waste of my tax dollars. We should be building and expanding more bike infrastructure,  not tearing it up. There should be separated bike lanes on every major Toronto thoroughfare .\nStudy after study by experts in urbanism tells us that bike lanes provide safety benefits and economic benefits and environmental benefits. There\u2019s literally no downside that any reasonable person can point to.\nAs a motorist, with many cyclist friends, and an avid pedestrian, I support any and all efforts to get more bikes on our roads and take more cars off them.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly support the proposal. Reduction of the traffic lines for the creation of bike lines only creates big traffic. I live near the Bloor Street in Mississauga. I never seen anyone on biking on Bloor St.  in this area, and hardly anyone walks on the sidewalk in the area. The bikers use only the small streets in this area.\nThere are already bike lines on the Bloor St. from Islington Ave. going east. When ever I drive on Bloor St. going east from Mississauga, the moment I reach the Islington Ave. the big traffic starts.\nIrena G.\n"

        "comment": "I am against this proposal to remove the bike lanes on these major streets of Toronto. These routes are critical to cyclists navigating through the city, and see a huge amount of use. It is also incredibly important for us to maintain and continue to build more sustainable transportation options in the city, and biking lanes are central to this strategy - so removing them is a backward step in the wrong direction! There are numerous studies that show the community and environmental benefits of cities moving away from being car-traffic oriented, and removing bike lanes is a terrible idea if we want to achieve these benefits. Don't remove the bike lanes. There are other ways to address traffic congestion without ruining the network for alternate modes of transportation. Prioritizing car traffic over these alternate transportation methods is wrong and a step backwards.\n"

        "comment": "This decision is not one to be taken lightly. If you make the wrong decision then not only will cyclists die, but the vehicle driver will also be affected. The velocity that cars travel at on city streets make it likely that a cyclist will die if they are hit.\nThis is a personal issue to me because I am a parent to a young man that has a passion for cycling. He constantly sees vehicles that are disobeying street rules, and drivers that are distracted. I am afraid that he will get hit by a vehicle again. He was lucky the first time, and had no permanent damage. The next time that he gets hit, he might not be so lucky.\nThe bike lanes in Toronto help keep him and his friends more protected. It is less likely that they will be 'doored' by a vehicle because the bike lane is usually placed on the passenger side of the vehicle.\nThe bicycle lanes provide a clear designation that traffic with vehicles and bicycles are separated. Bicyclists do not have to assert themselves to take up the space on the road, and the rights of way that they are allowed. If you remove the bike lane, the bicyclist will take up space on the road and has the right to take up the whole lane. If you don't think that they will do this in response to the removal of the bike lanes, just watch them.\nThis is a decision that needs to be made on a block-by-block basis. Sometimes it makes sense, and sometimes it doesn't. A city can do that.\nThe City of Toronto has shown that bike lanes benefit the economics of the retail shop owners. And if there were no bike lanes then where are you going to put all of the UberEats delivery people along the Danforth? Back into the street? If you want to make a difference, get rid of car parking along streets such as the Danforth. There are only a few spots along the street, and they block traffic. There is lots of parking in the lots nearby.\n"

        "comment": "I am a 33 year-old teacher from Toronto. I cycle and am looking forward to Toronto becoming a city with a great cycling culture with infrastructure (bike lanes, sheltered bike racks, signs and lights). We have to build the city we want, even if there is a delay in that vision becoming a reality. We need to keep the bike lanes, change driving culture to be safer (including down on cell phone use while driving and running red lights) and once people see that the bike lanes are being respected, they will come. If they see that they are unsafe, they won't use them. We need to use other cities as models and see what works in Toronto. Let's use our biking culture to promote our city's goals to reach net zero and reduce our emissions. Let's incentivize cyclists with tax credits on their purchases. Let's take good care of our bikeshare program and provide opportunities for kids, families to start cycling.\n"

        "comment": "Most importantly, this is a local issue. The province should not interfere with Toronto city council decisions.\nBike lanes are an essential part of Toronto's transportation infrastructure. They have been proven to reduce congestion in the long run, by encouraging people to get out of cars and bike instead, thereby reducing car congestion and saving energy. These bike lanes provide cyclists with safe ways of moving through the city and thereby reduce motor vehicle congestion. I own a car, but choose to bike year round in Toronto as it is efficient, enjoyable, and these bike lanes make this possible. If they are removed, I would be forced to drive more for my own safety, thus adding to traffic. Ripping out existing bike lanes is a retrogressive step that will cost taxpayers needlessly and result in the death and injury of cyclists and pedestrians.\n"

        "comment": "So once again the Premier of Ontario is choosing to use his power to harass Toronto rather than serve the Province and address the actual problems Ontarians care about.  For the sake of reminding the Premier as he seems to conveniently forget what these items are, they include healthcare, housing and affordability.  So I have some questions that are going to end up being rhetorical as I doubt they will receive a proper answer.\n1 - Who is this bill for?\n  * And no, car commuters is not a valid answer as it has been proven time and time again that more lanes will simply lead to \"induced demand\".  Which to put simply, is the effect of pushing more people to commute by car when we make it easier to commute by car. So increasing the number of lanes will also increase the number of car commuters which contradicts the entire point of adding those lanes to begin with. (ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_demand)\n  ** Let's also set the facts straight on local businesses.  More car lanes do not increase local traffic for businesses because cars are almost always used for trips from home to some location and back again.  Additionally, the required parking for local businesses comes with a price either to the city or to the businesses themselves. (ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_High_Cost_of_Free_Parking)\n2 - How does this actually reduce gridlock?\n  * See my previous point explaining induced demand.  Making it easier to drive is always going to increase the numbers of drivers on the road which means more traffic.\n  ** In contrast to more lanes, less car lanes will reduce the number of cars passing through an area because it is now more difficult to do so.  Adding a bike lane further reduces the number of cars passing through as it provides alternative commuting options.  People would now be able to get to work via bicycle, scooter or with other mobility devices.  This could introduce a brand new market for small personal mobility devices (and it already has to some degree) which would help stimulate local economies.\n3 - What is your plan for non-drivers?\n  * A fair share of Ontarians do not own cars. The vast majority of Toronto residents do not commute by car and instead opt for public transit. Why should these individuals have to not only have their commutes made more complicated by additional car lanes, but also pay for these car lanes indirectly via their taxes? (the Ontario gas tax was the primary funding source for road maintenance, which was cut for purely political reasons)\n  ** Many of the aforementioned non-drivers may be handicapped or mobility impaired and require the use of personal scooters or similar devices.  Bike lanes provide these individuals with an opportunity for safe mobility that doesn't interfere with sidewalk foot traffic.\n *** Finally, choosing to not drive is becoming a financial decision to save money.  Cars are expensive, and yet the Premier and other politicians seem very intent on forcing people to depend on these expensive tools. The Ontario government's desire to remove alternative forms of transit is making peoples' lives more expensive, and let's not forget the Premier's broken promise to bring down car insurance.\nIn summary, bike lanes are a necessity for rebuilding our local economies which are still recovering from the Pandemic and reducing the economical burden that more car lanes bring.  Our cities cannot afford more car lanes, and neither can Ontarians who are choosing between rent and food.  Bike lanes are proven to increase economic activity to the benefit of local businesses and provides alternative mode of transportation to help Ontarians save thousands of dollars in expensive car fees a year.\nWith both consumer cost savings and local business benefits in mind, removing bike lanes would be an incredibly fiscally irresponsible decision that only serves politics and not people. Beyond what I have mentioned here, there is still a plethora of other reasons Bill 212 is a terrible idea.  This includes safety for both commuters and youth who are too young to drive cars along with millions of taxpayer dollars being wasted that could be used to address the actual crises Ontarians want solved.\n"

        "comment": "The amount of time this saves people in their commute, does not come close to the terrible environmental impact this will have on our (already dwindling) natural spaces in Southerm Ontario. Our current infrastructure is not working, will continue to worsen in the coming years under climate change. Already a trend of working from home has started, counterintuitive to the coming desolation proposed to build more roadways. Green bicycle lanes are a part of the way to the future. Already the calls to action to save our beautiful country from climate change are strengthening. To the Ford government: Listen to the science. If not, at the VERY LEAST listen to the people whom you claim to serve in your roles of government.\nBe on the right side of history. Put this money towards better public transit systems and preserving and restoring the natural environment we have already lost too much of. Delaying true progress and doubling down on these old, failing systems will only increase the negative outcomes our children and their children will face. Our technology and infrastructure must be co ducive to a flourishing planet with flourishing ecosystems for our future health and survival. The tax payers' money should be invested into something more sustainable, not just poorly considered \"bandaids\" that help line the pockets of your political friends and donors. These things will have to change eventually, and are clearly going to be forced to change in the years to come. Why don't you be the heroes in this story, not the villains. Do right by the province that we gave you responsibility towards. Listen to us, the voters and taxpayers who fund your currently wanton and greedy lifestyle. Prove that you are better than what it seems you are shaping up to be.\n"
