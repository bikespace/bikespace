        "comment": "It is completely false that bike lanes cause traffic congestion.  The Premier and Minister of Transport continue to lie about this Bill.  The causes of traffic congestion are: dependence on private vehicle, lack of alternative modes of transportation and construction.  The local BIAs want bike lanes because they increase business.  Roads should be safe for everyone, especially the most vulnerable users such as pedestrians and cyclists.  There are numerous research studies that support the implementation of bikes lanes:\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2210670722006229\nhttps://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1755-1315/771/1/012032/pdf\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/237524182_Bicycle_Tracks_and_L\u2026\nThese studies conclude that bike lanes increase cycling traffic, safety, improve air quality, improve quality of life, increase public transportation use, increase pedestrian traffic, and mitigate income inequality.\nBike lanes even reduce traffic congestion so that drivers can move through streets more efficiently and safely.\nSix cyclists have died on the streets of Toronto.  Removing bike lanes will cause more death and injuries and exacerbate traffic congestions.\nThe Premier and Minister of Transport is clearly appeasing their own personal agenda with Bill 212, rather than serving the greater public at large.  All the evidence conclude the exact opposite of what they are purporting.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose the bike lane provisions of Bill 212, for the following reasons:  (1) It is an unacceptable and unwarranted intrusion into local authority; (2) It unfairly and unnecessarily gives priority to vehicles on the use of roads, at the expense of cyclists and other forms of active transportation; (3) it reduces road safety, making cycling more dangerous; and (4) it reduces the positive contribution that cycling lanes can make to traffic calming and to the environment.  Bill 212 is a poorly considered and retrograde measure that should be withdrawn.\n"

        "comment": "I am a suburban resident in a riding that is currently Conservative, and I strongly oppose this bill. Removing bike lanes would not reduce gridlock, since it would just cause bikes to go in the car lane. On the other hand, providing safe alternatives to driving for people who want them helps traffic. It removes cars from the road and prevents accidents. This is not a matter of choosing between the best interests of drivers and cyclists - both are helped by including bike lanes in road design. It is also good for business, because cyclists go at lower speeds and have more flexibility, making them more likely to stop and shop.\nFurthermore, I urge the government to protect our farmland and protected areas, and to save taxpayers billions of dollars by abandoning Highway 413. We are facing increasingly more destructive natural disasters and food prices are astronomically high. The cost of both of these factors need to be considered when deciding to destroy our rich farmland and green spaces for a massive infrastructure project that will induce more demand for driving.\nLastly, I oppose the provincial government\u2019s continual attempts to override other elected representatives, like municipalities and school boards, and to exempt itself from existing laws. I would like to see more respect for the separation of powers that keep democracy strong. Micromanaging municipal matters is inefficient and does not serve Ontarians. We elected local representatives who best understand the needs of our communities, and they should be allowed to do their jobs.\n"

Instead please consider using the money that would have been used to remove much needed bike lanes, to make transit more available or speed up construction both of which are contributing to traffic.  It is frustrating for tax payers to see that money continues to be wasted by reversing things that have already been paid for.\nPlease remember that the province is not made up of only people who drive cars.  Some drivers may not like bike lanes, but for those who use them, bike lanes makes it safer and saves lives. Many who use bike lanes are parents with families, who live downtown specifically to have a drive-free lifestyle.  They also use transit and they also pay taxes.\nBike lanes are a minor irritant and removing them would be a \"soft win\" which will appease a few, for a brief period of time, but in the long run will make NO difference to commutes but will increase the risk to those who cycle.\n"

Improving road infrastructure like dedicated lanes for public transport and more bike lanes would present alternatives reducing the number of cars on the roads. Every cyclist on the road could be considered one less car in the street. Not to mention that bicycles do not wear and damage the street surface like automobiles, and create no pollution/ emissions.\nI am a senior from a car-less family and rely on bicycling and walking for my daily errands. I live close to Bloor street, where I shop. I use University Ave and Yonge Street 2-3 times each week to go to church, medical appointments and entertainment. I bicycle for ecological and financial reasons, to preserve my mental and physical health, for convenience and independence. To be deprived of this possibility would have disastrous effects on me and my family.\nRemoving any bike lanes would practically endanger my life: forcing me to choose between the very stressful and dangerous merging with motorized traffic [which would also slow down said traffic!] or giving up bicycling and therefore my mobility right in my 'golden years'!

        "comment": "Subject: Request for Removal of Bicycle Lane on Broadview Avenue\nI am writing to express my concerns regarding the newly installed bicycle lane on Broadview Avenue, specifically on the north side from Pape Avenue to Cosburn Avenue. The bicycle lane spans only a short stretch of approximately 200 meters, and there are no designated bicycle lanes before or after this segment. This limited installation seems illogical and is causing significant issues for residents like myself.\nI reside at 1164 Broadview Avenue, and since the installation of the bicycle lane, I have faced considerable difficulties accessing my driveway. The metal barriers installed alongside the bike lane make it extremely challenging, if not impossible, to safely back out or enter my driveway. Furthermore, this section of Broadview Avenue is heavily trafficked, especially when Don Valy highway closed. Traffic congestion has become much worse, resembling a parking lot during peak times.\nI question the necessity and practicality of a 200-meter-long bicycle lane that does not connect to any continuous bike network. Cyclists seem to either merge into traffic before this segment or abruptly exit afterward, creating confusion and potential safety hazards. It appears to be a poor use of taxpayers\u2019 money, given the disruption and inconvenience it has caused to local residents.\nI kindly request a review of this situation and urge you to consider removing this isolated bicycle lane segment. The negative impact on traffic flow and the accessibility issues faced by residents outweigh the benefits of having such a short, disconnected lane.\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your response and hope for a swift\n"

        "comment": "This is a backwards bill that makes me embarrassed it is even being considered. Bike lanes are a part of every healthy city. When bike lanes are made well, they reduce traffic on the road creating a faster commute for everyone. We don't reduce gridlock by adding more car lanes, we do so by providing alternatives to personal vehicle use. This is well studied!\nA lack of bike lanes will not stop serious cyclists from riding on the road, but the presence of protected bike lanes will encourage everyday people to use active forms of transportation in their daily life, which is healthier for those biking, reduces carbon emissions, and reduces the number of cars on the road. A lack of protected bike lanes will only lead to more fatal crashes between cyclists and motorist.\nPlease think about our future as a developed province when considering this bill. Look at the healthiest societies around the globe and you'll see that biking infrastructure is essential to their population's daily lives.\n"

        "comment": "I write as a citizen in my mid-60s who still regularly cycles, and who has been promoting cycling in my city for the past four decades.  This has included forming a bicycle user group (\"BUG\") at my former large high-tech workplace and serving on the board of our local non-profit cycling advocacy organization.\nThe proposed Ontario Bill 212 represents a very short-sighted and risky direction for the future of people in Ontario's municipalities and in the world in general.  By short-sighted, it puts the emphasis on the motor vehicle over a more sustainable means to travel--the bicycle.  We have to put walking, transit and cycling above private auto transportation if there is to be any hope of blunting the effect of global warming and checking urban sprawl.  The provincial government should thus be greatly increasing the funding of sustainable modes rather than wasting our tax dollars to rip up Toronto cycling infrastructure.  Similarly, municipalities should be able to decide for themselves what to do with their road networks.\nThe proposed legislation is risky not only in what it could mean for our environment but also in how it jeopardizes personal safety for me and others who choose to cycle.  Utilitarian cycling needs to be promoted, and that means replacing a car trip to do shopping and errands, and not just for commuting.  If one cannot cycle safely to a business on a major street, which could be the result of Bill 212 in my own city--and is sure to be an outcome for several roads with bike lanes in Toronto--then how can we get people to leave the car at home?  Of course, not everyone has a car, which leads to my next point.\nSome Ontarians depend on cycling to get around, as they cannot afford a car.  They may not even have the means to pay for transit.  Equity is important.  They still should have a right to safe mobility to destinations beyond the range of walking.  Many of those destinations (shops, banks, libraries, community centres,...) would be situated on a thoroughfare such as a Yonge Street or a Bloor West.\nCities are still developing their cycling networks.  There will naturally be gaps in the early stages, which limit the uptake in use until more of those networks are built out.  You also cannot assume that future demand is not there if a bike lane looks empty at a certain time of the day.\nIn summary, this Bill is misdirected and regressive.  It induces demand for more driving, just as recent Ontario changes made it easier and free to renew a plate sticker and now faster speeding is permitted on 400-series highways.  Cycling is one of the solutions to gridlock.  Invest in it!  For sure, there is a need for motor vehicles to be used for specific tasks within cities.  However, a large proportion of the auto traffic circulating at peak periods is composed of single-occupant private vehicles.  More car lanes invite more cars.\nLet municipalities roll out their transportation plans in the manner that recognizes sustainability and equity.\n"

This will increase release microplastics into the environment through care tires, and increase congestion and releases of greenhouse gases from cars.\n3) municipalities do years of planning and consultation to put in bike lanes and are best placed to make these decisions. Having the government now need to approve bike lanes adds reds tape, time, and makes these decisions political as it is up to the minister to decide.\nRemoving these lanes will only result in more reliance on cars, cause traffic, release pollutants, and endanger cyclists lives.

Bicycles are also more affordable.\nThe removal of bike lanes would have a devastating effect on my life and independence, as I am a senior who bikes and walks everywhere daily. I bicycle for the physical and mental health benefits, the independence and convenience it gives me, for its ecological and financial benefits. Bike lanes ensure my relative safety on the road. Without a dedicated bike lane, I would have to either choose merging with motorized traffic - a very stressful and unsafe alternative that would incidentally also slow down car traffic - or simply give up bicycling, and therefore my independence and connections to community, health services, church and shops I visit weekly on Bloor, Yonge and University.
