        "comment": "Thank you for introducing this Bill.  The City of Toronto has become a logistical nightmare to navigate.  This impacts the economy, the vibrancy of the city, and all its residents.  It has become an embarrassment for this city, and has a deterrent effect on those wishing to remain here.  One of the worst decisions in recent years has been the installation of protected bike lanes along major city streets, such as Eglinton Avenue West, Bloor Street, and University Avenue.  Not only do these protected bike lanes cause problems for people with accessibility issues, they snarl traffic and impact those local communities, and those who are commuting through.  Not every resident is able to ride a bike to work, or to run errands, or to take their children places.  The number of dedicated bike lanes is disproportionate to the needs of the city and its residents.  Further, there is no starker example of the adverse impact that such bike lanes pose to our city: Eglinton Avenue West.  For over 10 years, the communities along this portion of Eglinton suffered through the severe inconvenience of the LRT construction.  While problems persist because the Allen Road northbound does not have enough access lanes, all existing traffic problems were exacerbated significantly by the ill-thought decision to install dedicated bike lanes along portions of Eglinton (e.g., between Chaplin Crescent and Lascelles Blvd).  This has done nothing but create a more dangerous situation and slower traffic for all who need to traverse this area.  There is seldom a time where traffic is not backed up for kilometers, bumper-to-bumper and crawling along Eglinton Avenue West just to get to the Allen Rd.  Access to the Allen Rd is already problematic enough - this has made it all worse.  Any cyclist does not need to rely on Eglinton Avenue West to get around, particularly when there is the Kay Gardiner Beltline nearby.  Road-raged drivers then race through residential side streets trying to make up the time they have wasted sitting in this traffic.  The danger posed to children at nearby schools cannot be understated, while residents have to listen to continuous honking while needless emissions pollute the air.  There is no longer any confidence in the City of Toronto's ability to do what makes sense for its residents, particularly when it comes to easing traffic congestion.  Please intervene to remove existing dedicated bike lanes along major thoroughfares that Toronto residents, workers, and business owners rely on, and please stop the city from installing any more dedicated bike lanes, particularly in already congested areas around the Allen Rd.  Instead of wasting taxpayer money on these initiatives, these funds could be better spent, such as improved public, accessible transit for all those who live, work, and want to enjoy Toronto.  Thank you.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is an utter charade, no part of it comes from a place of thought and reflection on how to make Toronto a more enjoyable and accessible place to live. It fails on so many levels that it shocks me that it has gotten as far as it has in the legislative process and that it has support from Minster of transportation; it\u2019s embarrassing to hold that tittle and to propose a bill so ignorant which will cause the exact opposite to what they are proposing. There are 2 points that I want to outline:\n1. Proposing to remove existing bike infrastructure is a waste of tax dollars and it makes the bikers unsafe for as well as pedestrians. Why does that city need to cater to drivers when most of the people in the city do not drive?\n2. Removing bike lanes will only increase the traffic and gridlock. You are forcing people that are regularly choosing to bike to drive which will bring more cars to the streets. There are studies done here and in other countries that have proven time and time again that making biking safe and accessible decreases traffic and our environmental foot print.\nI wholeheartedly oppose this bill and I think it should be entirely scrapped as the province has no business forcing blanket laws on cities in this manner.\nOn a personal note, I use bike lanes regularly and in if they are removed you will find me biking on my own car lane as I do not feel safe sharing a lane with a car.\n"

        "comment": "It is infuriating that the Ford government is once again, ignoring the abundant evidence and expert advice that bike lanes are do not contribute to traffic congestion. If he wasn't so busy buying votes, Ford could focus on joining Toronto's fight to prevent blocking intersections through automatic camera enforcement power, and sharing more dollars for traffic wardens.\n"

        "comment": "The \u2018City of Toronto Cycling Study\u2019, conducted 5 years ago and available for ANYONE to read on Toronto\u2019s official website, concludes 70% of Torontonians cycle, and 44% of Torontonians are utilitarian cyclists. Given that the data confirms these numbers have consistently increased since 1999, we can safely assume these numbers are likely larger and more significant in 2024.\nIn what WORLD is this proposal to remove already existing bike lanes on Yonge, Bloor and University a proposal based on fact or data?\nCycling reduces carbon emissions and reduces the number of cars on the road, especially in the downtown core of Toronto. Bike lanes provide safety to cycling commuters and save lives. Amid a climate crisis that had the DVP under water just this summer, we\u2019d like to rip out bike lanes to incentivize more cars on the road? Never mind the cost to taxpayers to have these bike lanes built in the first place.\nDoug Ford is an uneducated college dropout, and his push to remove these existing bike lanes proves this point. Perhaps we propose that the provincial government focus on their responsibilities of expanding Metrolinx and MODERNIZING transportation policy, and leave municipal decisions to the elected municipal government.\n"

        "comment": "This is not an appropriate issue for the provincial government to focus on. We vote for municipal representatives to take care of municipal matters and expect the Ontario Government to respect municipal decision making, just as the federal government should respect provincial jurisdiction.\nBike lanes are a valuable part of our mobility infrastructure. They keep people moving safely, without contributing to harmful emissions that are causing huge negative environmental impacts. The climate crisis is also costing us money; how many billions can we continue to spend on flood and fire recovery? Every effort made to reduce carbon emissions is vital.\nRemoving existing bike lanes and reducing municipal ability to install them will cause injury and death to people who also deserve to move freely around our cities without fear. I am deeply offended that our provincial government has so little respect for the value of Ontarian\u2019s lives.\nThere is no evidence that this is a solution to congestion. Please make evidence-based decisions for the health and safety of all Ontarians.\n"

        "comment": "The streets in our cities perform multiple functions, and are best able to serve everyone when an appropriate balance of uses is put in place.  Historically our city streets have been complex and creative places, accommodating pedestrians, cyclists, motor traffic, transit vehicles, goods movement as well as providing space for utilities and telecommunications.  Allocation of space was based on the needs of everyone in the community.\nThe increases in car traffic from the end of World War Two through the end of the 20th century tipped the scales away from a balance of uses to a car-centric focus whereby other uses and purposes were intentionally made secondary to car traffic in an ultimately futile attempt to \"relieve congestion\" and \"allow drivers to travel without impediment\".  While these changes allowed our cities to expand and absorb more people and support more jobs, they created an unsustainable burden.\nWider roads and more highways attempted to counter the impacts of greater segregation of uses, expansion of low-density suburban employment, consolidation of retail activity, the move to multi-worker households, and other demographic trends including significant population increases.  In cities, particularly in older, larger cities, there was no real space to increase the number of travel lanes, and other modes including streetcars, buses, transitways, subways, commuter trains, walking and cycling allowed growth to continue.\nThe pressures to use the limited space to move more and more people started to look at historical solutions.  Until the middle of the 20th century the majority of transport on our streets was communal or for good movement.  Taxis, jitneys, bicycles, wide sidewalks and limited private vehicles shared space with delivery vehicles.\nTransit seemed to expand as well, but never matched the pace of change in car travel.  As central Toronto grew upwards to accommodate more and more jobs in the core, walking and streetcar travel was augmented by car traffic.  That traffic quickly absorbed the capacity freed when goods movement reduced.  The next wave of expansion was the subway system, which permitted people to live further from the core, but still travel in and out in a reasonable time.  The average commute time increased very little, but the number of commuters increased, as did the average travel distance with longer subway trips increasing the overall average.\nThe next wave was the joint introduction of GO Transit and the PATH.  The two complemented each other, allowing for even longer trips at the same average commute time, and a way to walk to thousands and thousands of jobs from Union Station.  GO Transit would not have succeeded without the PATH as the limited sidewalk space would not have accommodated the increase in pedestrian activity.  We see this today with both the sidewalks and PATH ways congested during peak hours.\nThe most recent wave is the increase in downtown residential development coupled with suburban job growth.  Some of this growth is accommodated in reverse flows on transit, using the transit system more effectively, but most of it required outbound car travel in the morning as the suburban jobs are so dispersed they cannot be effectively served by transit.  Evidence of this is the traffic volumes on the DVP, where AM outbound trips outnumber inbound trips, and along the Gardiner where there is both an inbound and outbound rush in the morning and evening (and for most of the day).\nAs the city continues to grow and expand, we need to consider a balanced system.  Walking is self-limiting as few are willing to walk for more than 30 minutes to and from a job.  Cycling was accommodated in the inner city on the well-developed network of local streets, but that too is limited by major physical barriers, including highways, railways and river valleys.  There are no viable \"local street options\" for cycling outside the core of the city that support anything more than local area traffic.\nI've heard the point raised that we should not have cycling on Bloor Street, but on local side streets, but I'm not aware of any local street crossing the Humber River from Bloor to the Queensway, or any well-connected local street that crosses the QEW, Etobicoke Creek, Mimico Creek or the two major rail corridors.\nTo compete with other cities and maintain the quality of life we enjoy, we need to consider how we can best manage the resources we have.  Cities have done extensive analysis and consultation in planning and managing both growth and movement.  Expanded cycling facilities have attracted large number of users, and will continue to grow exponentially as a large, connected and integrated network is created.\nThe current legistation, as proposed, attempts to counter the current growth trends, invalidate the good work undertaken by city staff, cater to a minority of people who believe they are entitled to unfettered car access on demand.  The focus of traffic studies used to be on the number of vehicles moved.  At one time a bus was counted as the equivalent of 3-5 cars, but as they could be carrying 25-50 people, their effectiveness was under represented.\nToday most traffic planner recognize that a successful mobility solution focuses on the total number of people moved in a corridor, at how well the system interconnects to provide multi-modal trips and address first and last mile solutions for all trips.  To be truly representastive of the needs of Ontario's urban population, the provincial focus needs to move away from mid-20th century measures of success and look for innovative ways to balance mobility, measure success in people movement and appropriately address these factors in any proposed legislation.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes save lives and have been shown to have minimal impact on traffic. They reduce greenhouse gas emissions by encouraging Torontonians to consider alternatives to commuting by car. They represent a net benefit to the city and its residents.\nRemoving protected cycling lanes will not reduce the amount of cyclists in the city, nor will it reduce the gridlock that has been generated by decades of underfunding public transit and inducing demand for car travel with ever-widening streets and highways. Bike lane removal will, however, increase conflict between cyclists and motorists, and will almost certainly lead to an increase in cyclist injuries and deaths.\nFor the prosperity of Toronto and the health and safety of its residents, this shortsighted policy must be reversed.\n"

These lanes are crucial for several reasons:\nSafety: Bike lanes provide a safer space for cyclists, reducing the risk of accidents and encouraging more people to choose cycling as a mode of transportation.\nEnvironmental Benefits: Promoting cycling helps reduce traffic congestion and lowers carbon emissions, contributing to a cleaner and healthier environment.\nHealth and Well-being: Cycling is a great form of exercise that promotes physical health and mental well-being. By keeping bike lanes, we encourage a more active lifestyle among residents.\nCommunity and Accessibility: Bike lanes make our city more accessible and inclusive, allowing people of all ages and abilities to navigate the city safely and efficiently.\nCity Charm and Competitiveness: Bike lanes enhance the charm of our city, making it more attractive and livable. They also help our city remain competitive on an international stage by showcasing our commitment to sustainable and progressive urban planning.\nRemoving bike lanes would be a step backward in our efforts to create a sustainable and livable city. I urge you to consider the long-term benefits of keeping these lanes and to continue supporting initiatives that promote cycling and other eco-friendly modes of transportation.\n"

        "comment": "The Ministry's directive to assess whether a bike lane would \"unduly diminish\" the flow of motor vehicle traffic could unintentionally favor vehicle capacity at the expense of active transportation. In light of Ontario's objectives to foster sustainable, safe, and inclusive transportation systems, recognizing bike lanes as a vital component of infrastructure that enhances public health and alleviates congestion could be advantageous. This approach would support the province's commitment to lowering carbon emissions and promote active transportation.\n"

The availability of cycling infrastructure allows us to do this safely and reduces congestion because then we are one last car on the road. We cycle to work, to pick up our son, to go to events in the city etc.\nMany of the bike lanes have also only recently been installed using tax payers dollars. To rip them out is a huge insult to tax payers everywhere, the environment, urban planners and data that says they help reduce congestion, not the opposite.\nI find this bill and the abuse of powers in it disturbing.\nIf the government wants to bury a removal of environmental protections to build highway 413 behind, do so honestly without making Toronto less liveable and less safe for me and countless families in the city.\n"

Studies have shown that building more road infrastructure will increase traffic, not decrease it. Requiring provincial oversight into bike lanes is not going to address gridlock. What will address gridlock is proper funding for public transportation and badly needed public transportation infrastructure updates. I am happy that the province of Ontario is addressing that piece. Removing bike lanes or requiring provincial oversight on bike lanes is not. I strongly recommend that the premier's office take up the offer from the Ontario Traffic Council to review data and work together to mitigate gridlock. This legislation is not going to address the issue it purports to.\n"
