        "comment": "Bill 212 is terrible for the future of Ontario.\nDedicated bike lanes added in Toronto (e.g. Bloor, University) have made me switch from driving to riding my bike with peace of mind knowing that I am separated from cars. It also makes the city more beautiful and honestly the traffic for drivers is still the same (I am also a driver in the city). Removing bike lanes will not make traffic any better in the city as more drivers will be back on the road (causing traffic again) and bicyclists will now just be in danger. The province should not be concerned with traffic in the city, that is for the city to decide.\nAlso what is the rationale to avoid an Environmental Assessment for Highway 413? This is incredibly short sighted policy.\n"

        "comment": "This is ridiculous and stupid. Bike lanes REDUCE TRAFFIC. Bikes are slower than cars, so if you remove bike lanes and force bikes into car lanes, traffic slows down!\nWhy are we spending money on this ridiculous overreach instead of underfunded health care?\nDoug Ford is still mad he wasn't elected as mayor of Toronto and wants to do it from the premier's office. We need someone in charge who will spend less time micromanaging Toronto and more time running the province.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is most likely a total waste of time.\nBikes compared to cars are:\n1. Cheaper to purchase\n2. Encourage a more active lifestyle, meaning widespread use will aid in reducing  the load on our health care system.\n3. Put less stress on the road since they are slower moving and lighter, meaning having to pay for less road maintenance.\n4. Easier to accommodate for parking, meaning inner cities might be able to do away with street parking freeing up another lane of traffic anyway.\n5. Are more environmentally friendly. Admittedly a secondary benefit, but nobody likes air pollution, and if it can be reduced it should be.\nEven just looking at it through a financial lens let alone the other benefits, bicycles should be encouraged and there\u2019s no better way than dedicated bike lanes. Without them, cycling in the city is more akin to putting your life in the hands of the motorists around you, many of whom are angry and may not give you the space you need as a result.\nThe main reason to vote conservative is to peel back regulation and bureaucracy. Why is this government trying to add as much as possible?\n"

        "comment": "I would like to address the ongoing issue with the bike lanes on Yonge Street between Bloor and St. Clair. While the intention behind these lanes is commendable, the current setup has resulted in significant challenges that are impacting the flow of traffic and overall accessibility.\nFirstly, the reduction of the roadway from four lanes to two has created severe traffic congestion, particularly during peak hours. It is now common for what should be a two - three minute drive from Yonge and Church to Price Street to take upwards of 20 minutes. This congestion is not only frustrating for daily commuters but also poses a serious problem for emergency vehicles, which are often unable to navigate through the gridlock, especially when compounded by the Caf\u00e9TO installations.  I witnessed an ambulance maneuver its way between two cars and scratching  the back side of a vehicle on route to an emergency.\nThe combination of bike lanes, reduced lanes for vehicles, and additional street usage from outdoor dining has stretched the capacity of Yonge Street beyond its limits, making it inefficient for both motorists and emergency services. While promoting cycling and outdoor dining is important, the current setup is not sustainable in such a critical area for city traffic flow.\nI urge the city to reconsider this configuration and explore alternative solutions that balance the needs of cyclists, pedestrians, and drivers while ensuring the city\u2019s core infrastructure remains functional, particularly for emergency access.\n"

        "comment": "Hello! I am an Ontario resident residing in Kingston.\nI wish to comment on the proposed Bill 212, the \u201cReducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act.\u201d\nGiven the nature of rapid climate change and its effect on the food chain, extreme weather events, forest fires and population migration, I feel it is unwise to oppose any effort to increase the number of Canadians using non-vehicular forms of transportation. Bike lanes keep cyclists, and increasingly users of electric scooters safe from vehicle traffic, reducing the number of cars on the road and the amount of CO2 gas emitted into our atmosphere. Not to mention the help it does to bring physical activities to people's lives especially those in cities with less and less green space.\nFurthermore, I believe traffic management and road planning is best handled by the municipality where much more scrutiny can be applied. Cities and towns have a flow to them that isn't always apparent to outsiders, and their traffic planners are in the best place to decide when and where to install bike lanes.\nPlease invest more into trains, bike lanes and family doctors. This and more highways are not the long term solution for our great province.\nFor these reasons, I strongly oppose Bill 212.\nSincerely,\nA Kingston, Ontario resident.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is completely wrong-headed and contrary to all evidence. Consider the following:\n- bicycle lanes reduce congestion, as they replace some vehicle traffic (which takes up a full car space) with a bicycle (which is smaller - you can check if you are not sure about this)\n- removing bicycle lanes will mean there are more cars taking far more space than the bicycles they replace\n- those who still use bicycles to commute or reach destinations will take the lane instead of travelling in a separated bike lane; this is worse for congestion and less predictable for all road users.\nAs far as I can tell, this bill is pure ideology and pre-decided politics. No basis in facts or evidence. No respect for the lives of people that will be killed in traffic accidents because of this. Absolutely horrendous. Disgraceful. You should be ashamed.\n"

        "comment": "Poor urban planning has resulted in Toronto\u2019s congestion reaching the point it is at now. It is certainly not a solution to stop municipalities from building bike plans, or god forbid, remove them. To reduce car traffic we need to provide more safe and convenient alternatives to driving, and that includes safe cycling infrastructure. This legislation would harm cyclists and make it more unsafe for them to get around, and do very very little to address traffic and improve congestion. In fact, increasing priority for car transit will only incentivize MORE CAR TRAFFIC.\nI have been a supporter of the Ford government for years but this is a red line for me. Continuing to prioritize cars, and dragging their feet on alternative modes of transit, and now attacking cyclists and safe alternatives to driving, is just a red like for me. I implore this government to retract this proposal immediately, and commit to providing Ontarians a better plan for safe transit in our province.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is a total waste of energy and resources. Bike lanes that are separated from car lanes REDUCE gridlock by getting people out of their cars. The only way to reduce gridlock is taking cars off the road, not expanding lanes, reducing sidewalks, building new roads, or removing active transport infrastructure. To think otherwise is false!\nIt is unbelievable to me that the province would be this concerned with municipal decisions. Please stay in your lane and fix education, healthcare, and public sector wages!\nMost importantly, selling this bill to be completely about bike lanes is terrifying. There is nefarious business hiding in this bill about the proposed highway project. Please do NOT pass this bill with any language that precludes development of a highway from passing environmental scrutiny. We need to be protecting our environment in Ontario and not building unnecessary roadways on top of it.\nThere are other sustainable solutions to fixing traffic and congestion, but clearly the current rulers of Ontario are too lazy and corrupt to consider them.\nPlease do not pass this bill!!!\n"

The province should focus on highways and transit in order to ensure good regional links and transport between cities, not streets in one municipality.  I\nEven worse is spending provincial money and construction impacts on a city street.\nFinally, the idea that 3 cycle lanes are the only thing between Toronto having good traffic and bad is laughable.  All the highways are already far beyond capacity and encouraging more driving and space for parking is not going to improve the situation.\nI am all for constructing hwy 413, but let the city (aka local people) decide local issues, not the province.\n"

        "comment": "I am a 26 year old Toronto resident who regularly bikes to work. I am deeply disturbed by Premier Ford\u2019s proposal to remove bike lanes on 3 major Toronto streets, with zero plan of how bikers are supposed to navigate the city otherwise. Toronto is lacking in side streets that span large areas, making the proposed alternatives even more absurd. I promise that cyclists prefer riding on smaller roads when available, but there are no alternatives sometimes. Removing bike lanes will not resolve congestion, but do you know what will? Better transit. I moved here 4.5years ago and was told the Eglinton LRT was almost done, and now I\u2019ve nearly completed an entire PhD and it is still being postponed. This is a much better target for the provincial government\u2019s time and energy.\n"

        "comment": "While the Province of Ontario has the right to legislate municipalities under the Constitution Act, 1982; I'd caution the province that, if the policy is to micromanage local affairs from Queen's Park, then, perhaps, maybe, I'd be less likely to lend a sympathetic ear when the Federal Government engages in micromanagement of Provincial affairs.\nThe bike lane policy in Toronto was arrived at by a democratic consensus among the citizens and taxpayers of Toronto. I don't weigh in on how people in Sudbury are zoning commercial land. I don't weigh in on how Thunder Bay is running their public swimming pools. Why should politicians from outside of Toronto have any say in how Toronto itself is governed?\nSo, the comment is one of caution. Rural MPP's should be particularly concerned about this threat. Do you really want people from the 416/905 telling your local representatives what do to in your own backyard? Careful eh. Because when that pendulum swings back the other way, maybe there won't be as much sympathy for your perspective on local democracy.\n"

Drivers will literally have to slow down behind me and wait for an opening to change lanes to go around me. The removal of bike lanes will not be saving anybody time. It will slow down traffic, and if I choose to drive in the absence of a safe bike route, worsen gridlock.\n"

There are plenty of other issues that cause gridlock like construction and street closure.
