        "comment": "This policy won't work to reduce traffic. There is absolutely no reason to believe that decreasing the number of bike lanes will reduce traffic congestion, or that adding bike lanes increases traffic congestion except during the construction process. Obviously, it is bottlenecks like intersections that create traffic. Adding bike lanes offers a safe and healthy alternative for commuters, which may plausibly decrease the number of cars on the road due to people choosing to bike instead of drive. Even if reducing the number of bike lanes WOULD decrease traffic, which it won't, it is wrong to prioritize saving a few minutes of time over saving someone's life. This policy will kill people.\nCyclists are residents of the province, too, and deserve space to cycle. Think about the area devoted to highways, which bikes aren't allowed on -- tens of thousands of square kilometers. Compare that to the area devoted to bike lanes, which cars aren't allowed on (though they often go there anyways). It's hundreds of times smaller. How can there possible be any justification for further reducing the piddling amount of public space that is devoted to cyclists?\nFinally, this policy is bad for drivers. The amount of traffic that will be created, and money wasted, during the removal of bike lanes that have just been installed, should give pause even to residents who only ever drive. Moreover, bike lanes protect drivers from being morally, financially, and criminally responsible for the injury or death of cyclists.\nBike lanes make the city better for everyone. Don't remove or restrict them.\n"

        "comment": "Extra lanes never solve the issue of congestion. It has been proven over and over again that extra lanes only encourage more drivers to use said road and create the same level of congestion. This would also be dangerous as a completely straight and wide road encourages reckless driving.\nAs a city where residents mainly move on foot, public transit, and biking, we should not be prioritizing the movement of cars and sacrifice the convenience and SAFETY of pedestrians and bikers. We should be thinking of how the majority of the population in this area actually move around. The answer is not cars.\nBeyond this, we should also be prioritizing infrastructure for pedestrians, public transport, and biking as this is the most sustainable and convenient way of moving around the city. If moving around the city without cars was easier, this would discourage driving and reduce congestion. Urban living does not have a space for car-centric culture. Additionally, fighting climate change also does not have a space for car-centric culture. All signs point to a better future where car use is significantly reduced.\nAlternative modes of transportation need to be invested in for the betterment of Toronto. Backwards thinking like more lanes = less traffic = better has no place in the future of Toronto and does not help the majority of the population of Toronto.\n"

Also, commuters should be encouraged to take public transport on their way to work. And funds used to support public transport rather than ripping up bike lanes. We need safe streets not more cars clogging up streets or going faster than they should.\n"

Even with the few bike lanes we have, the memorials for bikers that have been hit & didn\u2019t survive should be key enough to continue and prioritize the protection of bikers in the city. The amount of construction that this city has going on all at once is what slows traffic down, not bikers. Please consider our safety and the importance of keeping them.\n"

        "comment": "1. This bill is a blatant attempt to interfere with strictly municipal affairs on provincial level.\n2. This bill is removing the freedom of choice from the people with regards of methods of transportation available.\n3. This bill reduces safety of all participants of traffic, not just bikers. Having bikes and motor vehicles share the road again will lead to more conflicting situations on the road, while increasing the possibility of curb jumping, which puts pedestrians at risk. In other words, this bill will result in more road accidents and meaningless deaths.\n4. This bill will not serve its purpose (reducing gridlock) - the gridlock was there even before installation of bike lanes. If anything, it will actually make the gridlock worse due to induced car traffic.\n5. This bill would drastically worsen air and noise pollution. By removing the option of safely taking a bike, people who would bike previously would be forced to drive their cars, contributing to the gridlock this bill is attempting to \"fix\".\n6. This bill will not improve the business along the streets that have bike lanes, quite the contrary - as it will reduce foot traffic (due to air and noise pollution; no one takes a stroll next to a busy road) and increase motor traffic, the demand for parking would also be increased. These factors will contribute to the reduction of customers for businesses - pedestrians won't just randomly come in to the shop while walking, and the drivers won't come in because of the lack of parking. In case of restaurants, they'll also see the reduction of takeout orders, as it'll be harder and more dangerous for delivery people on bikes to navigate so they won't pick up those orders.\n7. This bill is informed by populist \"culture war\" agenda instead of factual data analysis and traffic/urban planning professionals' consensus.\nUltimately, this bill is an absolute waste of time and taxpayer money with zero benefit for anyone. It won't just not serve its purpose of reducing gridlock and saving anyone any time - it would make it worse. The gridlock was there before installing bike lanes. Removing bike lanes not fix it, it will only reduce the available transportation options. Think of it this way: we all know the good investment portfolio should be diversified. Same with transportation - the more options on how to commute there is, the more gradual distribution of traffic between different transportation modes becomes. Removing bike lines, in this case, is akin to putting all of our stock in \"driving\" category and forcing more people to drive. It is a net negative, no matter how you look at it, and passing this piece of legislation would just show the people of Ontario how utterly incompetent this government is.\n"

        "comment": "Please do not pass this bill.\nThis is significant over reach from a government that said four-plexes province wide was over reach.\nBike lanes are proven world wide to reduce traffic, and removing bike lanes will only induce more car traffic.\nThe majority of people driving in Toronto don't even live in Toronto. It would be better to expand the bike network and the GO train network to reduce suburban car traffic into the city.\nThis bill would negatively set Toronto back back over a decade undo positive progress to make Toronto a sustainable city.\n"

        "comment": "This is a terrible idea for the general population, I don\u2019t know the stats but from my experience a majority of the workforce does not have access to their own cars or automotive methods of transport.\nRemoving bike lanes just takes anyway an avenue for people to efficiently commute to work without financing and going into debt owning a car.\nPlus more highway lanes do not fix congestion. See the narwhals articles referencing this matter and other journals done on the matter.\nIf the problem was about making commuting easier, investing in more means of public transportation while leaving the roads as the are now would be the smarter play. I just hope this decision was not made to satiate selfish agendas\n"

        "comment": "It seems like most people are talking about the proposed legislation as it relates to bike lanes, but whether or not there are bike lanes along Bloor Street in the Annex seems like a minor issue for the provincial government.\nWe should really be focused on the impact of forcing the construction of Highway 413 without a proper environmental assessment. One has to wonder whether traffic is actually going to get worse in the GTA once this is built, since it'll funnel cars from the communities that get developed along its route onto all of our existing streets.\n"

        "comment": "If part of the issue is first responders being stuck in traffic wouldn't it make more sense to widen the bike lanes enough for these vehicles to be able to pass through? Bikers are able to remove themselves from the road faster than cars and we all know that adding more lanes doesn't reduce traffic. A simple google search will show you that.\nAlso most residents in Toronto actually move around on foot or on bikes. The city should not be scared of radical changes that actually involves REDUCING traffic lanes. Wider sidewalks and bike lanes would do so much more for the city and its residents than more traffic lanes.\nTo solve the problem of congestion at its core, the city needs to be improving infrastructure for pedestrian, bikes, and public transportation. Investing in alternative forms of transportation makes moving around the city much easier and convenient and encourages existing drivers ditch the car.\nAll in all, removing bike lanes would be a massive step back for Toronto. Toronto needs to think ahead and move to the future. Save the bike lanes!\n"

        "comment": "As someone living and working in Toronto, the University and Bloor bike lanes are crucial for my commute to work 5 days a week. Removing the dedicated bike lanes would detract me commuting by bike due to safety concerns and therefore increasing my commute time. This bill will not cut down gridlock and will not save time for people actually living in Toronto. We need less people commuting by cars and better public transit options. This would move the city backwards.\n"

        "comment": "As a resident and daily commuter in Ontario, I am writing on behalf of my family and myself to express strong opposition to Bill 212, which seeks to remove vital sections of bike lanes from key streets like Bloor, Yonge, and University. Our family relies on these bike lanes as an essential part of our commute, using them not only for their efficiency but also for the safety they provide us and others. These lanes allow us, as cyclists, to navigate our city's roads securely, reducing the risk of incidents with motor vehicles and supporting a more sustainable, healthy means of transport.\nBike lanes are not just a benefit to cyclists; they serve the broader public by ensuring a safer, more organized flow of traffic for all road users. As drivers ourselves, we appreciate bike lanes for the protection they afford to vulnerable road users, creating a buffer that reduces potential conflicts and improves overall traffic efficiency. Without these dedicated lanes, we risk losing the protection they provide, creating a hostile and hazardous environment for anyone who chooses to commute by bike.\nAdditionally, bike lanes support essential infrastructure that aligns with Ontario's environmental goals, encouraging fewer cars on the road, lower emissions, and promoting active lifestyles. Reducing or removing these lanes directly contradicts efforts to foster sustainable urban planning and takes a step backward in making Toronto, and other Ontario cities, cities that accommodates diverse and environmentally conscious modes of transport.\nI urge the government to reconsider this proposal and instead view bike lanes as part of our essential infrastructure. Maintaining and expanding them, rather than restricting them, will create a more resilient and forward-thinking Ontario that truly meets the needs of all residents.\nThank you for considering these concerns.\n"

        "comment": "This proposed legislation really shows that the government is not interested in governing for all Ontarians, since it inexplicably seems designed to effectively punish people using bike lanes in our cities (Toronto, Ottawa, Kitchener, London, etc.)--which perhaps tends to be people who do not vote for the governing party.\nThis kind of behaviour is really out of step with democratic values and leads one to wonder how the government actually stands to benefit here. I think transparency is needed, for example, regarding who owns land that will be developed along the route of Highway 413 and what kind of ties they may or may not have to our premier.\n"

        "comment": "Protected bike lanes. I would ride my bicycle more often if there were more protected bike lanes.\nIf you build it, they will come. If we build more lanes for cars and trucks there will be more cars and trucks. If we build more protected bike lanes there will be more bikes and Ontarians will be healthier for this and small businesses (which I know this government supports) will thrive.\nGetting rid of protected bike lanes on major roads will not get rid of grid-lock. I live in Toronto and see that Bloor Street, University Avenue, and other major streets are not congested because of the bike lanes that are in place.\nPeople on bicycles are not second class citizens but the Ontario government makes us feel that we are. I am 78 years old and I am an educated woman who wants to stay healthy and active. The Ontario government, and the Premier, should not interfere with the way we travel to and from work, school, and shopping in our cities. Cyclists do no harm to the rest of our society and should be respected and accommodated.\n"

This will make commuting much harder for many Toronto residents and greatly increase injuries to both bikers and pedestrians. Reducing bike lanes will not reduce the number of bikers, but it will make biking less safe. Moreover, the urban infrastructure of the city of Toronto should be under the purview of the city itself and not the province.\n"
