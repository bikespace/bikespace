        "comment": "To the ministers concerned, and the Premier, I respectfully say that this legislation should be scrapped in its entirety, for three reasons.\nThe first is that none of what is proposed here will reduce gridlock, and it will cost a fortune to do a lot of nothing. Removing bike lanes will either force cyclists to share lanes with cars, or make them go back to driving, both of which slow down traffic. Building highways does not reduce congestion (and never has--induced demand has made the 401 and other provincial highways congested nearly since their inception), and the proposed Bradford bypass and highway 413 will not save anyone appreciable amounts of time. Similarly, increasing the speed limit on a highway that is already jammed with gridlock is an idea that is utterly and obviously without merit. It should not even require explanation.\nSpecifically regarding the bike lane proposal in Bill 212,  Look at the open letters from the Ontario Professional Planners, The Ontario Traffic Council and the 120 physicians at the University of Toronto (all attached) who have already expressed their opinion on this matter. Do the Ministers and the Premier value data-backed decision making? Do they think that they should listen to experts? Their own reports on this suggest that the removal of bike lanes will not help gridlock. Why would they ignore the information that they solicited on this matter?\nThe second reason this legislation needs to be entirely scrapped is the serious risk to public safety posed by the removal of bike lanes. Segregated bike lanes have numerous benefits (ask the credit card transaction records for Bloor merchants, who saw increased business after the lanes were installed), but the one that should be considered most seriously is the fact that they prevent the injury and death of cyclists. That the premier wishes to endanger people who are cycling to work, cycling to do groceries, or cycling to bring their children to school, simply so that he can (incorrectly) claim to be helping cars move faster is a disgrace to the notion of public service. The offices of Ministers and Premier are meant to serve the public, to make the best decisions for the citizens of Ontario, and this is in direct conflict with that principle.\nTo be brief: the Premier and the Ministers believe that more injured or dead cyclists are worth it, if it allows them to incorrectly claim that cars can move around faster.\nThirdly and finally, this bill constitutes a completely inappropriate use of provincial powers that is not in the public interest. Municipalities are the best governments to decide how to organize their own streets and traffic flows, and if and how they install bike lanes. The intrusion of the provincial government into this policy area, while legal, is a very clear overreach and results in more red tape for cities that need less of it--by the government's own admission. This is legislative complication where none is needed. This policy proposal is just one in a series of bills that the premier has enacted seemingly in an effort to spite the city of Toronto by overriding its ability to handle its own affairs. One could be forgiven for thinking that Ford is not from Toronto, as he seems to completely misunderstand or directly contradict nearly everything about the city's political preferences and its governance.\nOutside the city, exempting highways from environmental assessments is both highly suspect in relation to the Premier's relationships with developers who stand to benefit (I hope the integrity commissioner and auditor general have something to say about this) and a cynical ploy to accelerate an expensive and unnecessary series of pet projects that will help nobody, and harm many. The fact that this is included in the bill seems a quite transparent play to force some type of political horse trading with municipalities--you can keep your bike lanes if you let us pass this other, far more sinister plank of legislation.\nAs an Ontarian, I am frankly disgusted by this legislation and implore the government in the strongest possible terms to scrap it in its entirety.\nThe time of the legislature would be far better put to use in suggesting things that will help gridlock, like: better housing and zoning policy to encourage complete communities; vastly improved public and interurban transit infrastructure (including more consistent operating funding for local transit agencies); and enabling cities to make the best decisions at a local level to suit their different needs.\n"

        "comment": "From my experience as a pedestrian, cyclist, public transit user, and driver; removing the bike lanes will make commuting worse for most groups, and perhaps have no effect on on driving.\nCyclists will be injured and killed more frequently from being hit or doored, or purposely tapped by drivers (which I see on most main arteries without bike lanes).\nPedestrians will be dealing with more bikes and delivery motorbikes using sidewalks.\nCars will also find they are still mostly limited to one lane, as more cars will be on the road, illegally stopping and parking in the 'extra lane', especially as some cyclists will be using Ubers even if they don't drive themselves. Construction and delivery vehicles won't bother trying to find side streets or laneways and will absolutely take the tickets for illegally stopping instead of relocating.\nPublic transit users will see busier commutes, with more delivery cyclists and motorbikes trying to get their bikes onto the subways, as it will be faster than biking with this change.\nThe removal of bike lanes will not help anyone, even Doug Ford, but it will kill a few more cyclists and elderly pedestrians each year.\n"

        "comment": "My opinion is that the Ontario government needs to stay in its own lane.  I believe that local government has the best knowledge and experience to make decisions about bike lanes.\nInstead of encouraging more car travel I would like to see public transport - especially the TTC - improved.  More people on public transport because it is reliable, fast and inexpensive would be the best way to relieve traffic congestion.\nI believe that bike lanes are important to keep everyone safe, especially bicyclists.  Lives are at stake if existing bike lanes are removed and we do not continue to install new bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "Having just finishing releveling, replacing, and constructing bike lanes on Bloor and updating the bike lanes on University, Ontario now wants to spend millions to reverse its progress and eliminate them. These bike lanes cost millions of dollars and closed portions of major thoroughfares for months. Eliminating them is a waste of money and will contribute to, rather than lessen, congestion for the months it will take to dismantle them.\nThese few major bike lanes keep cyclists safe and offer Torontonians alternative travel options. In the city, it is faster to bike than drive. It\u2019s also much more dangerous. I know several people who have been injured as cyclists in Toronto and a peer of mine from university was killed in June when she was hit by a truck while cycling.\nIn other major cities, cycling is encouraged. It\u2019s better for the environment and the health of commuters. It reduces the number of cars on the road and speeds up travel times.\nWhy is Ontario interfering in municipal issues and putting in place regressive legislation like this?\n"

        "comment": "Please do not take out bike lanes that are already in place. That is a step backwards. We should be doing all we can to keep roads safe for drivers and bikers. We should be encouraging modes of transportation that do not involve increasing the use of gasoline powered vehicles, which pollute and add to climate change. Thank you.\n"

        "comment": "The removal of bike lanes from some of Toronto\u2019s busiest through streets puts public safety at direct risk. The ministry of transportation should prioritize public safety over the unfounded theory that removing these bike lanes would reduce car congestion. How do you propose residents are to travel safely east and west bound or south and north bound when removal of these bike lanes limits routes for cyclists to safely connect to common routes like the lakeshore without the risk of being blown off the road by cars? This is nothing but an irresponsible political tantrum. Putting peoples lives at risk to appease a minority group of car centric people is an egregious act. I do not support the removal of bike lanes and commend our policy makers to turn to peer reviewed research that has demonstrated the benefits and efficacy of bike lanes in reducing the risk of road related deaths and injury. I am sick and tired of populist politics that blatantly research and sound policy. How am I to trust the government if they never have our best interest at heart? Greed and capitalism fuels this current government. Rather than use limited tax payer money to remove these bike lanes, why not dedicate these funds to services you otherwise ignore like healthcare, education, support those who are unhoused, public health, literally any social health initiative would benefit from this money. What a waste.\n"

Bike lanes are an integral part of city infrastructure that thousands of people rely on each day to commute safely to work. Further, bike lanes do not in fact increase congestion. This bill will endanger cyclists and increase congestion, as cyclist will have to take up a lane of traffic instead of a bike lane.\n"

        "comment": "This is a terrible idea, and you will lose my vote. I depend on Toronto's bike lanes to get to work. It is too expensive to drive and park downtown and the TTC is much slower than riding a bike. Removing bike lanes only benefits the wealthy people who work downtown and can afford parking at $30-$50 a day. I thought your government was about the people, not finding ways to benefit the rich. I will still have to ride my bike to work, and this will just make it dangerous again, as it was before bike lanes. You can see the number of cyclist collisions has been dropping steadily over the last decade in the attached link.\nThis proposal is also an arrogant overreach. Let Toronto govern itself and worry about provincial mandates. Put your energy into healthcare, highways and education, which have enough problems to keep a provincial government busy.\n"

        "comment": "I am strongly opposed to the removal of bike lanes in downtown Toronto. My entire family uses them, including my 16 year old son on a daily basis from bathurst street to Greenwood on Bloor. A section of this has finally become safe for him. I drive in and out of the city at rush hour multiple times a week and the congestion issues are NOT downtown, they are on the 401 and the DVP, always.\nThere is the issue of optics as well; people believe the bike lanes are not well used because they don't realize that 20 bikes on the lanes looks like much less than 20 cars. But downtown I often see cars with a driver and no one else, and bikes passing much more quickly through these areas. People need to learn that biking is a vital city transportation mode especially since public transit is so spotty. It also takes time. Cities like Berlin and Amsterdam have a long tradition of bike lane use; Toronto needs time.\nFinally, the colossal waste of money to rip them out again is not what I want to do with my tax money.\n"

        "comment": "I do not support this Bill in any way. Reviewing municipal plans for bike lanes is way overreaching provincial jurisdiction and interferes with municipal planning and ability to respond to the needs and wants of local constituents. Removing bike lanes that are already built is atrocious, a waste of money, and simply Ford\u2019s vendetta against Toronto and bike lanes in general. Please make evidence based policy. There are multiple research papers and case studies demonstrating the benefits and positive impact of bike lanes on congestion. Leave municipal planning to locally elected officials who are responsive to the people living in these cities.\n"

They consulted citizens for over a decade at this point and we are finally seeing the benefits. TORONTO & ONTARIANS want bike lanes! They are critical transportation infrastructure.\nI lived in the burbs of the GTA for a long time! I used public transportation to get in and out of the Toronto and did not die. The length of time it took to commute without a car did suck though! Please make improvements to public transportation so that commuting from the burbs takes people less time and therefore less people will choose to drive cars into the city which will result in less traffic. It's the CARS not the bike lanes causing traffic in cities!\n"

They help keep me safe so I feel confident choosing to cycle knowing I will come home to my family each day. Please do not put cyclists lives in danger by removing this vital infrastructure. Cycling produces positive externalities for our communities by reducing pollution, providing exercise, and reducing car traffic. Ontario should be a leader in terms of evidence-based policy decisions when it comes to transportation infrastructure, and studies locally and from around the world show that bike lanes reduce congestion or have no effect on congestion (see linked CBC news article summarizing this research).\n"
