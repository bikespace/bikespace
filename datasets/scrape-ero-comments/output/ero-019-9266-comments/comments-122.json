        "comment": "This bill will put the lives of Ontarians in danger. As a nurse who bikes to work daily, and who sees the results of horrific vehicle accidents often, I implore you to keep cyclists safe by encouraging bike lane construction. Removing bike lanes and making their construction more difficult will not decrease the number of cyclists on the road, instead cyclists will be forced to use traffic lanes and sidewalks. Cyclists decrease traffic congestion by removing vehicles off the road. Our commute is beneficial for the province by decreasing emissions. Biking regularly also improves ones health thus reducing the likelihood of cardiovascular disease and other chronic illnesses, lessening the burden on the healthcare system.\n"

        "comment": "Surely the provincial government has more important and appropriate things to do toward reducing gridlock, than review municipal bike lane infrastructure.\nMore effective ways to reduce gridlock in highly populated places are strong public transit networks (across municipalities, thus more appropriate focus for the province) and carefully planning large construction projects and other disruptions to traffic flow.\n"

        "comment": "This bill saves nothing and is a waste of taxpayer dollars. Why build shelter from a storm just to tear it down when it rains. Fatalities involving cyclists are on the rise and aggression amongst motorist is evident. Should we not prioritize safety for the most vulnerable road users rather than cater to people who cease to understand that driving in the busiest city in Canada is no longer the best option.\nThis bill serves as inaction against a rampant problem in the city and fails to address the core issue behind traffic congestion being that more cars will only create more gridlock. Stop wasting our money and dismantling the possibility of having a functional city. Use these funds to address signal timing, road closures, parking violations, licensing inadequacies, road maintenance, or buying back the 407 (thanks for selling it off). It\u2019s interesting how the province has a distain with the idea of being defined by Toronto and yet they try so hard to keep this image going.\nLeave our streets alone Doug. Go waste more money on a tunnel or sell some playgrounds to your buddies to build a casino.\n"

        "comment": "This is a very misguided idea. Bike lanes are essential in providing an alternative to driving and transit, thereby reducing congestion. They do not cause congestion as they are more efficient than other traffic lanes at moving people. Where bikes are separated from cars, what causes congestion for cars is other cars.\n"

I have been forced to take alternative costly trains and buses, as the roads near me are not safe to bike on, especially with my children.\nBike lanes should be a key part of any transportation plans in Ontario and Toronto. Keep everyone safe and make space for cyclists.\nDo not destroy existing paths - enhance additional environmentally friendly alternatives by funding public transit.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are essential to this city. Look at other world class cities that are much larger than Toronto. There are all incorporating bike lanes into their existing infrastructure. This city needs proper solutions for traffic not bandaid ones like removing bike lanes. Imagine if all cyclists then started driving. It would be a nightmare.\nFurthermore, on all the routes that the proposal has mentioned there is street parking. Perhaps the removal of this during peak hours or entirely could create new lanes without having to sacrifice the bike lanes.\nI am a cyclist and rely on bike lanes everyday throughout the entire year. They keep us safe. Already the number of accidents and deaths from having the bike lanes obstructed is too high. If you remove the lanes you will directly be an accomplice for any future accidents and deaths that will occur as a result of unsafe biking conditions.\nI need to mention the cost of removal these lanes. As with the one on Jarvis that cost three times more to remove it than to install it, this is a misuse of taxpayers money. Additionally city issues should remain autonomous from provincial strongholds.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly disagree with this motion. The province should not have jurisdiction over bike lanes in municipalities, it is not the province\u2019s job nor should the province be dictating what municipalities can and cannot do with bike lanes. Bike lanes save lives and effective bike lanes do cut down on gridlock. Removing the bike lanes that already exist would be a huge waste of money and time and the disruption that it would cause would worsen the traffic, not make it better.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes and not allowing future bike lanes is not the future I want to build. I want my children to have the opportunity and freedom to travel even before they can drive. Drivers are careless, distracted, and find cyclists to be inconvenient causing road rage and unsafe road conditions. The purpose of a road is to move all people not just those that drive. The lack of concern for vulnerable road users is astonishing and should this bill proceed, the provincial government should be liable for every incident between auto and cyclists on roads with removed bike lanes or roads that bike lanes were not allowed to be implemented. I drive, and I understand traffic is gridlocked but making roads more unsafe is not the solution!\n"

        "comment": "I do not agree with this proposal.   The argument regarding highways is not relevant to bike lanes as bikes are not permitted on highways in any case.  This government has demonstrated that managing climate change is not their priority which for me should be their top priority.  Bike lanes in cities are a strong message to commuters to change their behaviour to more environmentally friendly means of commuting.  If this government is truly looking for ways to improve traffic flow in cities, I would kindly suggest that they make study of the Netherlands where this problem has been effectively solved, and could be applied at scale in Ontario cities.\n"

        "comment": "This is absolutely abhorrent policy and I'm floored that a government would be this inept to even allow this to be tabled.\nIt has been proven UNIANIMOUSLY that the ONLY solution to traffic in cities is to offer viable and alternative means of transportation. Prioritizing private vehicles only induces further demand because trips that could have been completed by an alternative measure (e.g. cycling, public transit) are not viable options. Have some faith in your municipal governments to make decisions that are best for their communities and stop trying to strong arm policies that don't fit your personal agendas.\nThe real atrocity here is that we'd even humour this idea, spend tax payer money and dedicate precious time of our public servants to even hear this idea out -- when right now we are struggling with a provincial crown corporation (Metrolinx) that has yet to deliver a single (!!!) complete transit project since it's inception over a decade ago. Why are we still in the dark about an opening date to EVERY LRT project in the province (Hurontario, Eglinton, Finch, etc.)\n"

The way we can truly reduce congestion is to get any cars that don't need to be on the road off the road.

They allow us to get to the city with the go train and get around this city far faster than if we drove, and now we also don\u2019t have to worry about being killed by a driver. Removing the bike lanes on any of the mentioned streets and preventing future installations won\u2019t speed up our drive, it\u2019ll only mean a much longer commute or both risking our lives and slowing down car traffic. I hope you will reevaluate this legislation if you value the lives or the time of commuting suburbanites.\n"
