        "comment": "Car traffic in Toronto has grown, but so has bike, e-bike, and scooter traffic.  Many people in this city make their livings on two-wheeled vehicles: bike couriers and food delivery workers.  These folks also use bike lanes wherever they are available and their jobs are made safer because of it.  My teenage daughter commutes to work using her bike on bike lanes.  Her safety would be severely compromised without bike lanes.  Additionally, many people, myself included, choose cycling as an efficient and healthy way to commute and get around the city.\nI also have a car and I also drive around the city.  I prefer to have bike lanes and have all the two-wheeled vehicles in a separate lane where possible.  Traffic for both cars and two-wheeled vehicles moves more efficiently and safely with bike lanes.  Instead of bikes having to weave in and out of traffic, slowing cars and creating safety risks, they are in a separate lane.\nIf a car trip does at times happen to take a little bit longer due to a bike lane, so be it.  With all due respect, people\u2019s lives are worth more than shaving a few minutes off a car driver\u2019s travel time.  Bike lanes save lives!\nIf you really want to tackle traffic congestion in the city there are many other factors at play that could be addressed.  Taking bike lanes away is unnecessary and reckless.  Requiring cities to go begging the provincial government for permission to build more bike lanes is entirely unreasonable and usurps what should be a purely municipal decision, and will only serve to block the expansion of the bike lane network in the city.  Ripping up existing bike lanes\u2026 a complete waste of taxpayers\u2019 dollars.\nI could go on about all the benefits of creating cities that are safer for cyclists, but many, many others have already studied and written about this issue, and found many benefits to a city having separate bike lanes. The Ford government has cited no data to support its purported rationale for ripping up bike lanes and blocking new ones.\nBack in 2017, Premier Ford publicly acknowledged how much safer he felt cycling in a bike lane!!\nPlease reconsider and withdraw this misguided, interfering, hostile and dangerous bill.  Please do not disregard the safety of all those who currently use bike lanes and the benefit to Toronto and other cities of having more people cycle once they realize that there is an established network of bike lanes.\nIn summary: I am 100% opposed to this bill and ask that the government withdraw it. If there are legitimate problems caused by any existing bike lanes, then assess and address those issues.  Do not throw out the baby with the bath water!!!!\n"

        "comment": "Our family cannot afford to live in Toronto and have a car. Biking has become our preferred means of transportation (we still use the TTC as well). Both my wife and I commute to work by bike, and bike lanes are very important for our safety, both when we bike on our own to work, or when we bike with our 3 kids on weekends.\nWe use the bike lane on the Danforth-Bloor corridor almost everyday. It is a cheap, light, easy, sustainable, fair (everyone in Toronto pays taxes to maintain roads, but big cars - sometimes from outside Toronto - think they are the only ones who should use them...) way of moving around. There is certainly room for everyone to use bikes, ttc etc, whereas there is certainly not enough room for everyone to have a car on these streets...\nFinally, we also don't understand why the province should intervene on something that has to do with our city, our neighborhoods, our taxes...\nPlease don't dismantle our bike lanes\n"

It\u2019s extremely dangerous to be biking alongside cars without a bike lane, please do not remove the current bike lanes. The city should be able to choose what is required for the city because it knows its citizens more intimately. Please keep the lanes that exist and do not spend money on removing them. I do not believe that the province should have this decision-making power about something that is so niche and particular to a city, and especially individual neighbourhoods. There are several reports that demonstrate that gridlock will not improve with the removal of the bloor bike lane. Please do not waste time and money on removing the bike lines.\n"

It will benefit not only the cyclists who will feel empowered to ride on these streets more often, but also the drivers who won\u2019t have to feel as worried about cyclists sneaking up on them or slowing them down. This is a huge step in the right direction towards active transportation and reducing the amount of cars on the road in the city.\n"

        "comment": "I have been hit by a car while cycling. I was doing everything right, but the driver was not paying attention and did not share the street. I think about how much worse my injuries would have been if it happened on main road, rather than a residential road. I think about the many times I have seen cyclists get hit or nearly get hit on roads without bike lane.\nI only feel safe while cycling using a bike lane or path. A driver could accidentally veer into a bike lane, but the likelihood of that happening is a lot less when lanes are separate. It's a lot easier to be careless when a driver is sharing the same lane as a cyclists. This is a no brainer. Reducing/surpressing the number of bike lanes makes us all less safe, drivers included.\n"

        "comment": "I have problems with this bill that encompass the following complaints:\n1) Provincial governments should not be adding red tape and bureaucracy to local municipality decisions regarding increasing transportation options. The amount of cars inside the city center is far too high and people need to be given alternatives to enter and exit it without having to resort to using a car that will just add to the gridlock we experience now. Adding more lanes to roads has never caused traffic to lessen, only get worse over time. Especially if the ONLY option to get to and from anywhere in the city is using cars (like taking away bike lanes would do).\n2) Gig work has become ubiquitous in the city and most of that work is done using bikes, or similar two wheeled motorized vehicles. This will not stop if bike lanes are removed. If the bike lanes are removed we will be facing a lot more fatalities and accidents to the people performing these tasks, as well as punitive damages to the people driving the cars. Accidents like this also stop the flow of traffic and cause more gridlock. It will be HARDER not easier to drive around in the city, as drivers will have to be a lot more cautious to avoid bikes they can't predict being around them, slowing traffic significantly. Removing these bike lanes literally makes zero sense if the goal is to improve traffic flow.\n3) Bike lanes support transit investment as people can bike to transit stations. Bike rentals help with this immensely as well as people can rent a bike local to where they live in the suburbs, and then drop said rented bike off at a transit station and go on their way. If we want to encourage people to use our transit system into which we are investing so much, we should be making it easier, not harder to get to them via as many ways as possible.\n4) If we are talking about environmental impacts, concrete is a very carbon intensive material to create. By ripping up these lanes we are adding to pollution overall on the planet. Concrete dust is also a bad pollutant for people's lungs as they have to breathe this stuff when it is being removed.\n5) The fact that highway 413 is in this proposal at all seems like an underhanded way to use bike lanes as a straw man to bully legislation through to make it easier to ignore environmental impacts of building through our green belt in the future.\nOverall I feel that this proposal is short sighted, underhanded and a disingenuous way to get tax payer money into the hands of private interests that are close to the people putting this bill forward.\nThank you\nMarko\n"

        "comment": "I live in Ottawa and not Toronto. But I visit family there several times a year. I bike commute and I drive when needed. Bill 212 is a complete overreach by the provincial government over something that should be dealt with by municipalities who know their own pain points. Toronto isn't the same as Windsor, or Ottawa, or Thunder Bay, or Owen Sound. this bill is a blanket decision that would have vastly different outcomes. Furthermore, motorists (like myself) should agree that bike lanes are better - it takes bikes off the driving lane AND protects the cyclist (also myself) = safe biking infrastructure. More people feeling safe to commute by active transportation would mean more turning to bikes and not using their cars which frees up the congestion caused by cars.\nFinally, I just want my kids to be able to get to school or their friends in the neighbourhood safely. Bike lanes help that. Any further bike or pedestrian accident by closing bike lanes is squarely blood on the hands of Ford and his government.\n"

        "comment": "Dear Toronto Officials,\nI am writing to express my strong support for the continued development and maintenance of bike lanes in our city. Safe and accessible bike lanes are crucial for promoting sustainable transportation, reducing traffic congestion, and improving public health. They encourage people of all ages to consider cycling as a viable and eco-friendly alternative to driving, which in turn supports the city\u2019s climate and environmental goals.\nAdditionally, dedicated bike infrastructure enhances road safety for cyclists, pedestrians, and drivers alike, fostering a more harmonious urban environment. Prioritizing bike lanes not only makes our city more livable but also aligns Toronto with leading global cities that have successfully embraced cycling as a cornerstone of urban mobility.\nThank you for your efforts in building a more inclusive and forward-thinking Toronto.\nSincerely,\nAn avid Toronto cyclist and mother of cyclists\n"

Studies also show that the best way to reduce traffic is to provide accessible public transit. So if you were serious about reducing traffic times you would be working on getting the Eglinton LRT running and improving public transit, especially to Scarborough. Withdraw this bill.\n"

        "comment": "To undo the work that was already done is a misuse of tax payers money. There are 1000s of bikers that use the lanes each day. Why would we eliminate such an important aspect of so many people\u2019s day?\nWith increased bike usage and increased accessibility of bikes with tangerines city bike system, the number of riders continue to increase. Therefore, there will be more riders on the road risking potential injury from aggressive Toronto drivers with an unjustified vendetta against bikers.\nFrom an environmental aspect, why wouldn\u2019t we encourage more people bike instead? Giving people more safe options for their commute seems like a great idea. Why wouldn\u2019t we encourage dispersing commuters to lower congestion in the city?\nThe bike lanes offer a safety net that is hard to find in a heavily dominated motor vehicle city. I admit biking can be dangerous, but systems like bike lanes help create a safe space. Furthermore, this safe space encourages more of our population to adopt biking as an alternative transportation method which helps reduce congestion.\nWhether this comment is read or not, i just hope whoever is making the decisions truly considers each and every aspect and has hard evidence to back up this proposal.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes provide safe and efficient pathways for cyclists to get around the city. Allowing the provincial government to hold jurisdiction over this does not make sense. We should be looking to make transportation options more flexible and efficient for those who need to get around the city. By nature, cars are much less efficient than busses, bikes, and streetcars when considering the amount of energy and physical space required to move a person from point A to point B. In a dense metropolitan area, such as the City of Toronto, efficiency of space is key. Encouraging efficient use of space is furthered, not hindered, by dedicated bike lanes, which both encourages bike lane use by providing safe options to travel without a vehicle, and does not encourage increased vehicle use. These decisions have the power to influence how communities make choices getting around the city. Providing a legitimate option between cycling and personal vehicles (by allowing adequate space for both as ways to get around the city) moves us in a direction of increased safety, efficiency, and personal freedoms. By increasing vehicle space at the cost of removing bike lanes, personal choices are effectively being removed as well.\n"

        "comment": "I am concerned about all facets of this omnibus bill.\nIn cities the addition of bike lanes, even when lanes of car traffic are reduced is the fastest, cheapest and most effective way to reduce almost every problem with human transportation. It reduces pollution, it reduces maintenance costs, it improves the overall usability of the neighbourhood, and it encourages exercise. Bike lanes also majorly improve the safety of roads for everyone - including cyclists, pedestrians and even vehicle drivers and occupants.\nDespite the misinformation shared by Balance on Bloor, bike lanes also are almost universally connected to more transactions for businesses along their routes, as cyclists are more likely to stop and explore local stores and restaurants, and the reduction of vehicular traffic makes the streets more pleasant for pedestrians to do the same.\nFurther than the bike lane issue, however, this act overreaches in its ability to take property from landowners who do not wish to sell, so long as the province plans to build a highway over that land. This is extremely unjust, and particularly offensive since the highway the Ford government wishes to build is entirely unnecessary and goes through sensitive Green Belt spaces.\nA better plan would be to invest in allowing all cities and towns to allow them to build out their transit, pedestrian and cycling networks, as well as to fulfill the backlog of necessary road maintenance. If you wish to keep traffic moving better, you could also invest in better signal systems to reduce conflict between drivers and all other road users.\nThere is no \"building\" solution to gridlock. The only solution is to reduce reliance on personal vehicles - whether in Toronto or in any small, rural town.\n"
