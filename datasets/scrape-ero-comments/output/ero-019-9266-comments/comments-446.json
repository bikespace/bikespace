        "comment": "I am a car owner and driver living downtown in Toronto. I commute out in to the suburbs every work day, over 400 km and about 10 hours a week. If such a bill would help anyone it would be me. Yet, I find this proposal nothing but offensive in so many ways.\nFirst, that the province thinks it knows better than municipalities where bike lanes can or should go is absolutely ludicrous. Beyond that, the public premise that getting rid of bike lanes will make any meaningful positive impact on congestion, when the actual effect will be to turn many of those cyclists in to additional motor vehicles, is absurd. This is a ridiculous bill put forward by a premier who has shown a loathing of downtown residents for decades, to distract the public from the shady projects he is pushing forward to line his buddies' pockets, and drive a wedge in the suburban vote that he hopes will be useful in his reelection.\n"

        "comment": "This is an extremely disappointing policy proposal for several reasons, detailed below.\nI am a young professional who has lived in Ontario all my life, and I care about Ontario communities and businesses, and contributing to Ontario's economy. These types of decisions make me consider moving to another province.\n1. Removing bike lanes goes against the evidence for addressing gridlock. Bike lanes are an evidence-based way to decrease travel times for all vehicles on the road.\n2. Bike lanes are good economics. They reduce strain on emergency and health care resources by promoting safety and fitness, and they increase business profits by increasing foot traffic.\n3. Bike lanes signal we are a city and province ready for the future. They show investors that we care about the environment and have modern infrastructure.\n4. Removing bike lanes is bad for Ontarians' wallets. Taxpayer money was spent to install bike lanes - many very recently - and using taxpayer money to take them out is wasted spending.\n5. The province has bigger priorities than interfering with local planning. We need to let cities make decisions about their local infrastructure and see the province focus on provincial issues like health care, energy, and education.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly object to Bill 212.\nPlease do not spend a single penny of my family's tax dollars removing bike lanes in Toronto or any other municipality. Nor should the Province create additional red tape for building bike lanes. Municipalities are best positioned to assess the transportation needs of their communities and the availability of resources and infrastructure to deliver effective and safe transportation solutions. Its embarrassing enough that this bill has even been tabled, do not embarrass Ontario on the global stage any more by passing it as-is.\nRemoving bike lanes and preventing future bike lanes will do tremendous harm to increasing housing supply and improving housing affordability. Many developers rely on public bicycle infrastructure to justify reducing expensive car parking and instead providing bicycle storage. Without the bicycling infrastructure they will have to provide parking, which can cost $100,000 per space which is the cost of the buyer.\nI am a driver and car owner, a pedestrian, a transit rider and a bicyclist. My options for getting to work are driving, biking or walking. And I exercise all of them based on my needs each day. When I bike, I use a bike lane (I do not work or live in Toronto). When I drive, I appreciate that cyclists have a bike lane separated from me. Bike lanes help beautify communities and make roads safer. They force drivers to drive slower and safer while still reaching their destinations in the same amount of time. Roads with bike lanes are some of the most beautiful.\nThese elements should be removed from Bill 212. And the Province should support municipalities in providing the type of bicycle infrastructure it does want to see, not ripping out existing infrastructure. It should also focus on expanding regional transit options, which is the role and responsibility of the Provincial government.\n"

        "comment": "Respectfully, this bill is very much a step backwards in the grand scheme of making Ontario a better place to travel. Inducing more citizens to be reliant on the automobile to get around for daily trips is not going to save everyone time and money. This is clearly a bill that is attempting to stoke a cultural divide that the premier is passionate about.\nAs someone who bikes everyday and regularly uses bike lanes in Ottawa where they are available, I have first hand knowledge that bike lanes increase the safety for all people. Everyday I see elderly using the bike lanes, I see families, I see children, and I see many commuters using the bike lanes to get to work while not contributing to the gridlock. Would this government rather have children cycle in the middle of the street in a car lane? In fact, removing bike lanes will create a situation that is worse for drivers as people that choose to still cycle will have to take up an entire car lane rather than being separated to allow vehicles to safely pass. Bike lanes help keep traffic following and are better for everyone.\nIf this government were serious about any policies they would focus on the more problematic issues such as healthcare and education. In fact, I currently do not have a family doctor and would appreciate if the provincial government were more focused on resolving real issues. I was considering voting for this government in the next election but will not if this bill stays. You were elected on reducing red tape and increasing efficiency but this bill seems to directly go against that. Do the right thing, admit the mistake and scrap this very problematic bill.\n"

        "comment": "I do not like this proposal for various reasons:\n1. Having the provincial government intervening on municipal issues slows down progress that can be made in developing bike infrastructure in Toronto.  It's an unnecessary bureaucratic step meant to halt progress within the city.\n2. The solution to gridlock is providing viable alternatives to driving. Removing bike lanes on Yonge St, University Ave, and Bloor St is doing the opposite. These bike lanes connect people to transit lines that are frequently used.\n3. As of now, biking isn't a viable way to get around the entire city as most of the infrastructure in the city is made for cars. To combat this, an adequate biking network needs to be built that can connect people to destinations. Unlike Montreal,  Toronto's does not have an adequate side street network to accommodate bicycles. These major roads need bicycle infrastructure as it's the only convenient way for cyclist to traverse through the city. Have bike lanes in places that do not lead anywhere, does not incentive people to cycle .\n4. We are prioritizing the least efficient mode of transportation. Trains, bicycles, and trams can transport more people to a destination that cars can, and they are more environmentally friendly as well. By building highway 413 and removing bike lanes, we are encouraging more people to drive which is not the solution.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose Bill 212, as it represents a significant step backward for cyclists and active transportation advocates across Ontario. Removing bike lanes will compromise the safety of cyclists and discourage the use of environmentally friendly modes of transportation. Bike lanes provide a safe and designated space for cyclists, reduce traffic congestion, and support healthier communities. Instead of limiting or removing these lanes, Ontario should focus on expanding bike infrastructure to accommodate the growing number of cyclists. This bill does not support the long-term goals of sustainability, safety, and accessible transportation options for all residents.\n"

However, those streets did not have any painted roads for bikes thus I did not continue biking as I felt unsafe. However, I was planning to use the bike lanes on Eglinton once they were completed. Now, I have changed locations thus will not be able to use those bike lanes but I am currently more downtown (near Bloor and University). There, I see a lot of people use those bike lanes everyday.\n"

        "comment": "A comment about the proposed removal of bike lanes in the city of Toronto.\nI believe that the removal on the any bike lane, but in particular the Bloor bike lane would be detrimental to the city of Toronto for the following reasons.\n1. It would hurt businesses.\nLocal businesses rely on local customers as their base, this means it is important for people that live near-by to have easy access to these businesses. For busy streets like Bloor or Yonge in downtown Toronto, easy access is rarely by car, it is often much easier to take a bike to a local store than a car.\nBy definition this bill is meant to reduce traffic but in removing bike lanes it will make more people drive locally and increase traffic.\nAnother issue the removal of bike lanes will create is that since more car will be required to be on the road, they will require parking spots. If those spots end up being on-street parking, any proposed traffic speed up will be non-existing as the lanes will be blocked anyway. If the parking is not on the main street, it will not be useful for going to a local store and will create issues for any local resident that may have their spots taken.\nAt the moment the Bloor bike lanes allow for there to be both a bike lane and on-street parking. Their removal would mean either the parking would need to be removed along side them, or remain and bring no difference to throughput of traffic as parking would continue to occupy a lane.\nThese two things, a lack of easy bike access, and a lack of easy car access (from a lack of parking) would mean that local business would suffer a loss of customers who would opt for now more convenient options like amazon or other types of delivery services (I know I would). This again would only add to traffic.\nWe have seen that businesses along long existing bike lanes support them and want to keep them, for example the Bloor-Annex BIA has come out in support for them.\nIt seems strange to me that a government as pro-business as the current one would force a decision on businesses that would harm them.\n2. It reduces the mobility of people who do not own cars\nThe city of Toronto is a divers place, and I don't only mean ethnically. There are people from all walks of life, students, kids, professionals, construction workers, lawyers, delivery drivers, etc.\nFor some of these people cars may be the easier mode of transportation, but for many it is not.\nKids cannot drive until they are 16, and then need to be able to afford a car to use one. Students are also often not able to afford a motor vehicle. Are these groups of people not important? Should they not be given a way to travel around the city?\nBike lanes help bikers travel safely through the city, and they are doubly useful for kids. Kids are short and hard to see from a car, and they are learning to navigating travel in a city.\nKids have places to be, school, the library, piano class, soccer practice, etc. If kids old enough to go to these alone had the ability to commute using bike lanes, parents would not be required to drive them there, again reducing cars on the road (and thus traffic).\nBeyond kids, there are a lot of people in the city that do not own cars. Sometimes it is a preference, sometimes it is because of cost. In a increasingly expensive city, why would we remove infrastructure that helps people save money? Why should only those who can afford a car be prioritised over other inhabitants of the city?\n3. Removing bike lanes will not improve the roads.\nI've mentioned it above, bike lanes help create roads that more usable. They allow for parking to exist along side them. They also mean that bikes and cars are separated. This is great for bikes as it is much safer for them, but it is also great for drivers that don't need to deal with a bike being in front of them biking slowly, or a bike they do not expect coming up along side them.\nReducing the amount of bike on the road proper is in the interest of everyone. Less interactions between bikes and cars means less accidents, less dead bikers and less traffic causing incidents.\n4. Red tape\nThe city should be building infrastructure. Bike lanes, streets, parks, libraries, public transit, parking lots. Adding red tape for this will mean this infrastructure will be delayed and more expensive than needed. Using tax payer money to remove something tax payers money was used to build is expensive and wasteful.\nPersonal experience:\nI can tell you from personal experience that since living in an area with more bike lanes my live has been made much easier and much nicer. I use my bike nearly every day to commute, to go grocery shopping, to go see friends, to go to the gym, etc.\nI don't bike because I'm a bike nut, I bike because it is the fastest, cheapest, most reliable way for me to get around; and bike lanes help make that a reality.\nRemoving bike lanes on Bloor, Yonge and University would make my trips longer (the most direct driving routes currently do not include bike lanes and are still slower than biking), more dangerous or more expensive.\nI spend much less time commuting now, in an area with bike lanes, than I did living in other areas of the city with none. This is in part BECAUSE of bike lanes, not in spite of them.\nI think the removal of any important part of the Bloor bike lane will be seen in the future as one of the worst mistakes in Toronto's history. Let's avoid it now.\n"

        "comment": "The need for bike lanes in Toronto, especially on Bloor, Yonge, and University, should not be decided upon by provincial legislators who spend little time commuting in the Toronto downtown core. They are commuting in from their respective areas like Brampton, North York, etc. and if they choose to drive instead of taking Go Trains, etc, they should blame themselves and not Toronto locals who cycle to help reduce traffic, parking, noise and air pollution, and importantly improve safety for pedestrians and other cyclists.\nThe city of Toronto has and has had mayors and councillors that prioritize bike lanes, because that is what the city and its residents want and need. Reducing traffic by encouraging cycling does a lot more for reducing gridlock than increasing traffic with more car lanes.\nToronto is a metropolitan city, not a sprawling suburb. We need more efficient ways of travel, like cycling, rapid transit, subways. The provincial government, and especially Doug Ford, need to focus on their responsibilities of funding transit construction and holding the contracted companies responsible for the endless, pathetic delays. They are as incompetent as the companies and workers who fail to finish the job of the Eglinton Crosstown and not-so-soon-to-be Ontario Line.\nLet the experts do the talking, Doug. Get out of your car and start cycling, and then you\u2019ll understand. Any Ontario MLA who supports this bill must also get on their bikes and experience Dupont Street, Yonge or Bay Street where there are no bike lanes. To take out major arterial bike lanes that are, often times, too narrow to be car lanes, is frankly, stupid. It is parked cars that take up space for car lanes. They need to be moved to underground and above ground lots. Build those, Doug, if you love cars so much!\nThe solution to grid lock is more transit and more healthy, safe cyclists who do not need to worry for their lives as the work, learn, and in live in OUR city of Toronto.\n"

        "comment": "This is a poor bill, and I must speak out against it.\nThe cycling component, with which I am most familiar, shows a misunderstanding of traffic. People using alternative, more space-efficient vehicles like bikes over cars reduces traffic overall. Besides, bikes being forced to use a vehicle lane is awful for everyone involved. It's stressful, its dangerous, and its slower than if each type of vehicle were given its own space.\nToronto's bike lanes have made great strides in the past decade, and I use them regularly - the Younge route in particular - to get to and from work, run errands and visit my partner and friends. They're great, and more and more people get use out of them every year. Even more people will be more included to use those lanes if they're safe and sufficiently developed to actually reach the places those people need to get to. This bill stands in opposition to that, and will just clog our roads with more traffic and more needless traffic deaths. Besides, isn't this more Mayor Chow's jurisdiction? This feels like Premier Ford throwing his weight around, just to feel tough as he smashes things he simply doesn't like. We should expect more from our leaders.\nHis highway 413 proposal is something I have less personal experience with, being a Torontonian cyclist and not a Bolton-area driver. Still, I know that eating toward our Greenbelt and mistreating our protesting workers like this is no way forward for Ontario. Furthermore, the position of this highway seems impractical for anything else that serving as the backbone of further housing developments that would serve only to enrich property developers. I am dubious that this is meant to help the people of Ontario, and quite certain that it won't.\nI implore the people of Ontario to vote, to make our voices heard. The 2022 general election saw a turnout of less that 44%, which isn't even a majority of our people. Apathy is dangerous, and leads to bills like Bill 212 - policy that will only darken our future.\n"
