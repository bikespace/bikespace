        "comment": "Dear Mr. Ford,\nAs a Toronto resident, home owner, and a driver in this city for the past 12 years, I hope you find my comment a decent representation of the opinion regarding this bill.\nThis bill is an egregious use of resources, when there are many more important and urgent issues that need attention. I understand your messaging regarding the need to resolve gridlocks, but attacking and marginalizing one group, that takes the least amount of space on the road, is counter intuitive and unbecoming of a leader of the entire province. We need to be more coordinated and multifaceted in approaches to solve complex issues, but that's what they area. Complex problems such as transportation cannot rely on simple solutions. The allies didn't win WWII with one type of equipment.\nAdditionally, removing infrastructure will only make traffic and driver and rider safety worse. With the increasing number of ebikes and bad drivers, you'll like end up with those vehicles taking the entire right lane, and driver traffic even slower, and reduce visibility from other drivers.\nWhat's needed to better accountability, so what's happening with fining drivers that block intersections or drive pass open ttc doors. And finally the accountability needed to complete the Eglinton cross. You do those things, the newly won st. Paul's riding will continue it's voting trend.\nThank you for reading this.\nKeep Ontario safe\n"

One death is way too many when it comes to bicycle riders.\u201d - Doug Ford (2017)\nIt\u2019s dangerous for cyclists to not have bike lanes. Bike lanes in my neighborhood in the Distillery have been great, and give me an opportunity to not take my car to go grocery shopping.\nBike lanes are good for business. They bring many riders to business on Bloor Street. Quote from article https://streets.mn/2022/01/26/bikes-and-business-on-bloor/:\n\u201c Beyond just perception, the city of Toronto\u2019s data showed that after the reconstruction, Bloor Street improved its safety for all users:\nthe total number of conflicts between all road users decreased by 44%;\nthe number of conflicts between motorized vehicles decreased by 71%;\nthe number of bike/motorized vehicle conflicts decreased by 61%;\nthe number of pedestrian/motorized vehicles conflicts decreased by 55%;\u201c\nThey\u2019re good for the environment.\nThey\u2019re good for public and personal health. I get exercise and get errands done in one task.\nBike lanes save lives - Stay in your lane Doug Ford!\n"

        "comment": "A CBC article from Jan 2024 said:  \"The TTC's Dufferin bus route received a mock gold award Wednesday for being Toronto's slowest bus route, with a peak travel time of 10.6 km/h. The Jane bus route came second with a peak travel time of 16.3 km/h, while third place went to the Steeles West route for a peak travel time of 17.5 km/h.\"  https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/toronto-slowest-bus-route-duffer\u2026\nAnd guess what? Neither of these roads have bike lanes. Neither does Eglinton or St Clair, which are parallel to Bloor and also get bumper to bumper traffic.\nBike lanes are not causing congestion or gridlock. There is no evidence to support this. If you really wanted to improve the ability to drive on main roads, then the government should remove parking from main roads. Especially if your argument is that we need to \"get people moving\". Then remove parking and continue to support bikelanes. This is an easy way to open up more traffic lanes while supporting alternative forms of transportation.\nBiking is an important transportation method for people in Toronto. \"Bike Share Toronto statistics show that ridership on its network of shared bikes has increased dramatically since 2015, when 665,000 bike trips were made annually. In 2023, that shot up to 5.7 million trips.\" https://www.cbc.ca/news/science/bike-lanes-impacts-1.7358319\nFor the record, I have never biked in Toronto. I think it's too dangerous. If I was killed by a vehicle while riding a bike, I am certain the Premier would not care and would not see it as an issue that needs to be addressed. I own a car and drive around Toronto often enough to know this issue first hand.\nBut why are we only supporting cars to get around? What about people who can't afford a car? What about teenagers who can't drive yet? Or what about the people who actually live in Toronto? Why aren't they more important than the people who commute here.\nI do not believe this decision is being made to impact any other city in Ontario. I think it's being made to pander to areas in the GTA that vote conservative and travel to Toronto for work or to attend events. The government has yet to cite any evidence that would support this decision. And worse, originally it was going to require evidence from municipalities but now apparently, we are just going to rip up bike lanes along the Premier's commute to work? This is awful decision-making and will be so damaging to pedestrian and biker's safety. It is a waste of taxpayer dollars to make infrastructure such a partisan topic. If you are going to use my tax dollars to do something, you should have evidence to say why it is a good decision.\nIt is ridiculous to think we should be supporting more cars to travel through Toronto. It is not viable. We will never be able to build the infrastructure to support that.  What is another lane on 3 roads in Toronto going to do to address gridlock? Why is the 401 packed if bikes are the cause of congestion?\nToronto is becoming a major city and the government needs to stop treating it like some mid-sized town. No one expects to drive to their job in downtown Manhattan, or Paris, or London. We need to invest in alternative forms of transportation and accept that driving in the most densely populated city in Canada is not an option for everyone.\nThe government's decision to remove bike lanes has no evidence. It is going to worsen safety for people in Toronto. It is going to worsen congestion by removing alternative forms of transportation. It is a waste of my tax dollars.\nI really hope the government reconsiders this decision. At least ask for the evidence you previously said you wanted from municipalities.\nSincerely,\nA concerned citizen who has lived in multiple cities in Ontario and owns a car\n"

        "comment": "Do not remove the bike lines - I was a driver in Toronto & regionally from 1999-2024 and a life long cyclist before that up to when I had my 2nd child in 1999, when I got my driver's license and started driving.\nMy car died in June and I got a bike instead to commute to St. George & Bloor, Danforth & Bloor bike lanes. My bike transit takes 22 minutes everyday. That's it. No delays, max 25 minutes if I go slower.\nSubway along this route MIGHT take 30 minutes in off hours and in peak time it can take longer, easily 45-55 with minor delays and intermittent shut down of subways.\nTypical scenario. Holiday Monday I took TTC to get to St. George and Bloor, subway shut down one stop after I got on. The 30 minute trip took 70 minutes with alternative bus & streetcars as Line 2 was down between Chester to Ossington.\nI am not alone in this. I LOVE driving. I'm not going to buy a new car, much as I would LOVE to. I LOVE driving. I pay taxes. I support development. I also want equitable access to a transportation network that supports folks who can't or don't want to own a car.\n"

        "comment": "The traffic I see on Danforth is definitely from construction not bike lanes. Broadview/Danforth construction (which is now thankfully done), Pape Ontario line construction is a mess, Bloor/Sherborne area road construction, the list goes on. Stop blaming cyclists and bike lanes for all the construction in this city that slows traffic down... Not to mention all the CARS that are traffic. More citizens in cities with inadequate/unreliable/underfunded/inaccessible public transit options means more people choosing to drive, which means more cars, which means more traffic.\nForcing cyclists onto the regular road instead of bike lanes will slow down traffic since they will merge with cars instead of having a dedicated space. They will also die and/or be injured because of your decision to do so.\nSigh. Do better. Please. You've been in power for so long now and have constantly made matters worse in this province. Not to mention all your purposeful acts of corruption. It's really exhausting!\n"

Scientifically, shown by many studies globally, encouraging safe mechanisms for bikes reduces the number of cars on the roads. In addition to this, again, scientifically proven, by adding more lanes, will only just encourage more drivers, thus, adding to the problem of gridlock.\n"

Every single talking point in support of removal of bike lanes is factually false- they ease traffic, they encourage local business, and most importantly they save lives.\nThe Ford government should stick to doing what it does best- handing millions to foreign corporations, spending millions fighting pointless legal battles, giving away public assets to land developer buddies, and trashing education and health care so they can hand it all over to their friends in return for cushy Board positions once they retire from politics.\n"

        "comment": "Why is the City of Toronto constantly regressing? Municipal taxpayers voted for and paid for bike lanes to ensure the safety of our neighbors. To reduce pollution. To promote healthier ways of living. I am genuinely embarrassed by this antiquated perspective, especially in comparison to world-class cities on a global scale.\nIn all of this, the Bloor bike lane stands out to me. Bloor is the longest central vein in the city, connecting the East and West end. Bloor has always been a single-lane street and the introduction of bike lanes has had no impact on traffic flow. When making this decision, does the Premier reference the ample data that supports bike usage on Bloor during rush hour? The enclosed link illustrates bike usage along Bloor during rush hour, which accounts for 37% of all road traffic (pg. 14).\nAll of this aside, why is the Premier making municipal decisions... while the province is a sinking ship? Toronto elected a Mayor last year. Communities continue to elect City Councillors like Diane Saxe, Alejandra Bravo, Ausma Malik, and Amber Morley, who champion bike lanes along these routes.\nThis sets a dangerous precedent for Torontonians whose best interests are (YET AGAIN) squashed by an erratic and corrupt Premier. This is not democracy! Doug Ford needs to keep his hands off of Toronto and focus on the province before it's completely pulverized by his incompetence. Mayor Chow, please intervene - Ford's bulldozer effect must end now.\n"

        "comment": "Since these are already installed, and very recently, doesn\u2019t it make more sense to collect data on how many people are using the lanes and how much car traffic is effected by it before spending money to rip them out? This doesn\u2019t make logical sense. I do feel the roads are for ALL traffic, not just cars. There are many more people on bikes and other electric vehicles because cars are not feasible for many. Cars are not able to move large amounts of people around, they move the privileged few. The city should be bolstering the creation of more efficient and cheaper ways of moving masses of people around the downtown core. Also, why is the provincial government meddling with how we manage our city streets?\n"
