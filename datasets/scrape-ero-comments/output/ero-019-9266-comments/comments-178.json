This must be to help reduce the polictal red tape, but then the requirement to have provincial government oversight for bike lanes is exactly contrary to that point. If the data shows a bike lane won't affect the flow of traffic that should be up to the municipalities to make these decisions.\nWe need more data to make choices for a better Ontario not less.\n"

        "comment": "I'm deeply upset that this government is considering requiring the removing of bicycle lanes and overruling the urban planning of municipal leaders. No one knows their city or town better than those leaders. Municipalities are in the best position to make local decisions.\nNot only does the province not belong in this area of urban planning, but there is no logic to this proposal. It truly makes no sense at all.\nI live in downtown Toronto. There are often significant traffic jams in my area. But never, ever, has it been due to a lack of lanes for cars. We have a limited amount of space in total. Creating an extra lane for cars on some streets doesn't address the multiple bottlenecks in the city. (And the same could be said for the Premier's recent proposal to tunnel under the 401. Creating twice as much room for cars on a highway doesn't mean that there will be twice as much room for cars on every intersecting artery.)\nI'm also a driver and I feel the road is much safer when bicycles have their own separate lanes. I'd rather spend some extra time in my car than have an accident with a bicycle. Cyclists are extremely vulnerable. They also have an equal right to the road. Bicycle lanes make it easier for everyone to be safe.\nI would like the government to focus on regional high-speed trains, improving local and regional public transit, and on providing meaningful funding for achieving more transit options. We need to get people out of cars and on to more efficient transportation, like public transit, regional trains, and most certainly, bicycles.\nPremier Ford's slogan used to be \"respect for taxpayers.\" Imposing the Province's will on municipalities is not respectful - it's undemocratic.\nIt feels like what the people really want doesn't matter to this government. Projects like this one can only be described as self-serving and are clearly not in the best interests of the people of Ontario.\nThis government was not elected with a mandate to micromanage municipalities and ignore the wishes of constituents.\nThis proposal demonstrates that this government has lost sight of their role and place.\nThe Premier is not a King who can impose his will on all his peasant constituents.\nStay in your own lane and leave municipalities alone.\n"

Studies of all other cities that improved cycling infrastructure showed that businesses, residents and commuters all benefited from the infrastructure. Particularly in North America, where vehicles are so large, encouraging people to commute in vehicles instead of on bicycles only adds to the volume of traffic.\nI also don't support the provincial government interfering with cities planners deciding what's best for their communities.\n"

What Ontarians need is more transportation options to get them where they need to go. More bike lanes, better transit, more walkable spaces - that will help alleviate gridlock.\nPremier Ford is the one here waging war on cars.\n"

        "comment": "It is with deep concern and disappointment that I submit this public comment on Bill 212, a piece of legislation that epitomizes misguided governance and a blatant disregard for evidence-based policy. The bill's proposals, particularly the removal of bike lanes under the guise of improving traffic flow, lack any substantive foundation. In fact, research and international case studies unequivocally demonstrate that removing bike lanes does not alleviate traffic congestion; it exacerbates it. Cities that have embraced cycling infrastructure, such as Copenhagen and Amsterdam, have seen tangible reductions in car traffic, improved urban mobility, and enhanced quality of life for residents. The notion that the removal of bike lanes would aid in the betterment of traffic conditions is not only baseless but wasteful, diverting public funds toward dismantling infrastructure that contributes to greener, healthier, and more sustainable communities.\nFurthermore, this bill reveals itself to be a gross misallocation of time and resources. The emphasis on bike lane removal as a \"solution\" to traffic issues is nothing more than a smokescreen for the real intention: to bulldoze forward with the ill-conceived Highway 413 project. This deeply controversial highway serves no practical purpose other than to further entrench Ontario in a car-centric culture while exacerbating environmental degradation, urban sprawl, and the erosion of farmland and ecosystems. Highway 413 is an affront to responsible urban planning, and its inclusion within the scope of Bill 212 is nothing short of an overreach of the provincial government\u2019s authority. Pushing through this highway, under the radar of meaningful public discourse, is an egregious display of political maneuvering\u2014one that prioritizes short-term interests over the long-term well-being of Ontario's residents and natural heritage.\nWhat is equally disturbing is the conspicuous absence of any meaningful consideration within this bill for transit improvements. It is a well-established fact that robust public transit systems are one of the most effective ways to mitigate traffic congestion and improve mobility, yet Bill 212 offers nothing in this regard. This omission further underscores the lack of evidence and foresight in the drafting of this legislation. If the government's true goal were to improve traffic conditions, investment in public transit and active transportation networks would be at the forefront of this bill. Instead, Bill 212 is a transparent ploy\u2014an effort to inflame cultural divides over bike lanes and traffic issues, while the real agenda of pushing through a politically motivated highway remains unchecked.\nIn sum, Bill 212 is a deeply flawed and cynical piece of legislation. It is devoid of genuine solutions to the pressing traffic issues in Ontario, offers no meaningful improvements to public transit, and represents a profound overreach of government authority in its push to fast-track Highway 413. I urge the Ontario government to abandon this misdirected effort and instead pursue policies grounded in evidence, sustainability, and the public good.\n"

Study after study confirm that the secret to relieving congestion is to have fewer cars on the road. I and dozens of my friends and family all use these bike lanes to commute in this city safely. I would love to know the last time premier Ford took the subway let alone rode a bike. There are more than just car drivers in this city.\nThis on top of the shady language surrounding highway 413 and other infrastructure projects. Engineers deserve a fair negotiated wage as much as anyone else.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 labels itself \"The Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time\" Act, but a more accurate title would be the \"Making Toronto Deadlier, at Significant Cost to the Taxpayer\" Act.\nThis Bill boasts all the essential elements of a Doug Ford government:\nWastefulness, deliberate undermining of transparency, government overreach, a complete disregard for the lives and safety of anyone outside his immediate voter base, and most of all a spit in the face of facts, data, and sound governance.\nWastefulness: dipping into public coffers to remove bike lanes installed and paid for under his own party's rule.\nUndermining of transparency: Under this Act, the government will have the green flag to continue their cloak-and-dagger manner of rule, seen most recently in the manner in which information pertaining agreements set in stone with Therme was withheld from the public, only seeing the light of day thanks to the efforts of investigative journalists. Bill 212 continues this exercise in anti-democracy by granting the government the right to hide from the public findings reported by a federal environmental assessment. What does Doug Ford and the Ontario government have to hide?\nGovernment overreach: Jurisdiction over decision making when it comes to municipal infrastructure such as roads and bike lanes should be left to those on the ground, who oversee and work with these systems everyday: in other words, the Municipality!\nDisregard for public safety: 2024 is not over, and yet already it has claimed the title as the deadliest year for bike riders in Toronto in its history: six deaths. For any government to even consider ripping out the only safeguards for biker safety in a city that is becoming more and more a personal-vehicle battle royale is irresponsible, unethical, and showing a complete contempt for Torontonians who together accounted for over SIX MILLION commutes by bike in 2023.\nFacts and Data: the removal of bike lanes will do nothing to ease the congestion currently grinding our city to a halt. Toronto is in this moment the fastest growing city in North America, with an underfunded transit system that is at the mercy of a car-centric transportation grid and the continued undermining of alternative modes of travel, like bikes. As studies have shown time and time again, induced demand will inevitably funnel these new Torontonians into private vehicles and onto our roads, leaving us with the same gridlock-plagued city, but far deadlier and lighter in the pocket.\nWorld class cities the globe over are embracing the future by implementing city-wide biking networks and investing in improved transit. Toronto is at great risk of missing the boat and once again finding itself in the position of being a relic in a new age.\nFor the love of God. Have a little foresight. A little vision.\nThank you.\n"

        "comment": "While I understand the need to reduce traffic.  The point of bike lanes isn't to take up space. We would love to be able to ride on side streets to destination in a direct way or on main roads with traffic at the side of the road. The point of bike lanes is to improve safety through separation. Might I suggest a compromise. We are all frustrated when we see empty bike lanes. This is usually due to a disconnected network and unsafe infrastructure. Might I recommend that any bike lane that reduces lanes of vehicle traffic be fully separated to encourage use, have a center turn lane that emergency vehicles could use, be part of a planned network that would connect areas that has population centers and destinations alternatively where cycle lanes are removed could the sidewalks be widened to multiuse path until cycling traffic would justify the removal of vehicle traffic lanes. Also to reduce red tape the province should only control bike traffic on provincially maintained roads. I wish there was a way that this government would see the value in all modes of transportation but please don't force cities to go through more red tape to justify valuable infastructure upgrades.\n"

        "comment": "ERO number019-9266\nI have serious concerns with this proposal. The underlying assumption is that more traffic lanes would equal faster traffic and this is NOT true. More traffic lanes encourage more traffic to take that route, increasing congestion.\nIt also ignores the massive contribution safe bike lanes make to reducing traffic as more bikes on the roads equals fewer cars on the road.\nI have lived in a number of large and small cities in the province and often find that biking is a faster mode of transportation than public transportation or driving; and the health and wellness benefits can't be denied.\nIn my experience having designated bike lanes increases the number of people choosing to bike.\nI strongly disagree with the provincial government giving itself the authority to prioritize traffic lanes over bike lanes. Municipalities should have the ability to make these decisions for themselves.\nI now live in a small town in a rural area with no public transportation and insufficient sidewalks. It often feels unsafe to walk or bike. The town is working hard to build more sidewalks and designated bike lanes. Imposing bureaucratic barriers that would strain an already stretched municipal office would mean bike lanes wouldn't be built/maintained and residents would suffer.\nBike lanes in larger cities are critical to ensure safety of those who commute by bike as well as families with children who would otherwise have no where to bike safely.\n"

        "comment": "We relocated to Ontario from a have-not province out west. The bike lanes here are incredible. They make traffic work so much better for commuters who would otherwise have to \"share the road\" with a tiny bike taking up a whole lane of traffic and slowing everyone behind them down to 20km/h. I drive to work and I feel much more comfortable with cyclists who can stay in their lane and out of mine. Every major metropolitan city in the world in investing in bike infrastructure, not ripping it up.\nFurthermore, I find this to be a massive overreach of the government into what is essentially a municipal issue.\nI don't know much about the plan for highway 413, but as a general rule, forgoing the environmental assessments sounds a lot like \"failing to plan\" which is, of course, planning to fail. I mean, we all live in the environment. We should have a good idea of the outcomes, positive and negative. You can't mitigate risks (flooding, frost heaves, animal collision) if you don't know what they are.\nOverall, this entire bill feels like a waste of time and money.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is foolish in every possible way. People riding bikes are not the problem. Garbage public transit across multiple municipalities in Ontario is the problem. Unreliable public transit is why people stop taking the bus/subway/train/streetcar and switch to driving a car. Provide provincial funding to cities to fix, upgrade, and frankly subsidize their public transit systems, and you will solve the province's congestion problems.\nOn top of this, active transit (walking, biking, etc) should be highly encouraged, province-wide, with more funding earmarked to support active transit infrastructure (segregated bike lanes, walkable 15-minute neighbourhoods, wide, well-maintained sidewalks that get priority for snow clearing, bike paths and foot/bike bridges that are kept open and free of snow during winter) not less.\nFurthermore, a proposal that requires municipalities to deal with provincial red tape in order to approve any new biking infrastructure will waste buckets of both money and time. For a party that touts itself as being anti \"big government\" this sure seems like provincial meddling in municipal affairs.\nIn short: What on earth are you thinking??\n"

Different officials were democratically elected by their constituents.\nThere are MANY studies that prove providing safe bike lanes and alternative transit LESSENS gridlock. The more people are forced to use cars, the worse traffic will be. The concept of Induced Demand has been observed when more car lanes are built, traffic increases by volume. This has been studied and observed all over the world.\nAlso I frequently drive due to work. Street and roads are often too narrow to comfortably and safely pass cyclists. Forcing us drivers to share the road will cause more cyclist deaths and injury. As fellow voting and taxpaying citizens, they deserve to have a safe place to commute. Especially with the increase of SUVs and pickup trucks on the road.\nI also oppose the new highway, I wish there were train lines being built instead! Rather than clog up the roads with more trucks and cars, we could be moving people and shipments much more efficiently with less environmental impact.\n"

        "comment": "This measure is deeply misguided as giving people more transportation options that will relieve traffic, not fewer. Ontario is already highly car-dependent and eliminating other transportation options will only make traffic worse. Not only will this measure have the opposite impact from its intention (if traffic alleviation is indeed the intention), it has the potential to put the lives of those choosing active means of transportation at further risk than they currently are. Segregated bike lanes protect cyclists from interacting with car traffic, reducing accidents and fatalities. Not only will eliminating bike lanes put more cyclists at risk, it will also contribute to slower traffic as cars and bicycles will now have to interact on the same road. Additionally, this is yet another overreach by the provincial government into municipal affairs that is part of a troubling and dangerous trend that erodes confidence in democratic institutions and further contributes to public disillusionment.
