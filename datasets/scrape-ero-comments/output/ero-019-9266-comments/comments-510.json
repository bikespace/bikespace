        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed bill 212. I believe this legislation would have negative impacts on road safety, urban sustainability, and environmental health, and I urge you to reconsider.\nFirst and foremost, there is no evidence to suggest that removing bike lanes will alleviate traffic congestion or improve gridlock. In fact, bike lanes encourage more people to use alternative modes of transportation, which can reduce the number of vehicles on the road and ease traffic overall. Eliminating this option will only discourage biking and increase the number of cars, counteracting any potential benefits.\nAdditionally, bike lanes provide a safer environment for cyclists, allowing them to navigate the streets with a sense of security. Removing these lanes not only increases the risk of accidents but also endangers vulnerable road users, making our cities less accessible for everyone.\nIt\u2019s important to note that decisions on bike lane infrastructure should rest with local municipalities, including city councils and mayors, who are more closely connected to their communities\u2019 needs. Such decisions should be guided by local data, traffic patterns, and resident feedback\u2014areas where municipalities, not the provincial government, hold expertise.\nI hope you will consider the consequences of this proposal on road safety, environmental sustainability, and local governance. Ontario\u2019s municipalities should have the power to determine what is best for their own streets and residents.\n"

Will save billions and can be done right now. Study after study has proven when more roads are built more congestion is created. Invest in transit. Upgrade existing roads.Save our prime farmlands and Greenbelt and our species at risk for future generations. Bill 212 will take Ontario backwards.  This is a wrongheaded bill. Repeal bill 212.\n"

        "comment": "Dear Premier Ford and the Minister of Transportation,\nI am completely and fundamentally opposed to the proposed Bill 212 for the following reasons:\n1. The proposed Bill 212 does not consider the safety and transportation needs of Torontonians and privileges the needs of commuters coming to Toronto from outside Toronto who wish to drive. My children bike to school and sports activities, my husband and I bike to work, and as a family we choose biking over driving whenever possible. This proposal will put my family in harms way. More provincial funding should be directed towards increasing and improving transit infrastructure. Perhaps a better use for the $200 that will be given to Ontarians would be to invest in transit infrastructure.\n2. A significant proportion of Torontonians use biking infrastructure to navigate the city (https://www.cbc.ca/amp/1.7374744). The 1.2% statistic cited by the Transportation Minister to justify this bill is fundamentally incorrect and inaccurate. High parking, gas, vehicle ownership costs make driving inaccessible for many. This bill will deny many access to affordable, convenient and safe modes of transportation.\n3.  Building more highways and making driving easier is a backward decision that will not reduce gridlock and discourages the use of public transit (https://thenarwhal.ca/ontario-highways-induced-demand-explainer/).\n4. Removing bike lanes and building more highways will contribute significantly to climate change and air pollution, and negatively impact the health and wellbeing of Torontonians.\n5. Removal of bike lanes adding more lanes of traffic will not reduce congestion ( https://www.theglobeandmail.com/drive/culture/article-drivers-bike-lane\u2026. ). In fact gridlock will increase with aggressive, impatient drivers leapfrogging around parked cars to try to advance a few cars. This will lead to increased driver frustration, more aggressive driving and more accidents, further adding to, not reducing, gridlock.\n6.  Removal of bike lanes and provincial regulation of future bike lanes in Toronto is undemocratic and fiscally irresponsible. Democratic processes have been followed to study, decide, plan and implement bike lanes in Toronto. This bill centralizes municipal decision making and the silences public voices and circumvents the public consultation process. The waste of municipal funds, generation of construction waste, and significant provincial funds that are required to remove existing bike lanes is a rediculous and irresponsible waste of taxpayer dollars that should be instead directed to our crumbling public education and healthcare sectors.\n7. Removal of bike lanes will take time and will cause gridlock through the process.\nFor all of these reasons and more I implore you to reconsider and scrap Bill 212 for the sake of Ontarians living in Toronto today and in the future.\nThank you.\n"

This is not what people of Ontario want. These bike lanes help keep cars off the road and it helps keep people safe. Bikers will not stop using these streets even if the bike lanes are removed.\nWe do not need more lanes and more highways, WE NEED MORE BIKE LANES AND BETTER PUBLIC TRANSIT. Please invest in these!!!! The best way to reduce traffic is to make it easier for people to use alternative modes of transit.\nIf it is decided that the bike lanes are removed, the government absolutely must provide CLEAR EVIDENCE that this is something the people of Ontario want, and CLEAR EVIDENCE of how this would improve traffic.\nCyclists will be injured if the bike lanes are removed and their injuries will be entirely Doug Ford and this administration's fault.\n"

        "comment": "As a Waterloo resident, and student of the accredited planning program of the University of Waterloo, this bill has the potential of damaging the urban environment which I call my home. The provincial government should not be adding more bureaucracy damaging local governments and municipalities who wish to advance their transit options for their own residents. Bike lanes are also essential transportation infrastructure, and are just as important as sidewalks are for people to get around. Another issue with this bill is that it further undermines the safety of bikers, who include young children and the elderly who are already more at risk. Bikers are very vulnerable without proper infrastructure and are nine-times more at risk when biking on major streets with parked cars, than on cycle tracks (Teschke et al., 2012). By passing this bill, the government of Ontario is demonstrating that it does not care about the safety of its residents. The government of Ontario is proving that it is dedicated, not to the improvement and development of modern infrastructure, but instead to the archaic Fordist practices that kill innovation, progress, and bikers.\n"

        "comment": "As residents, pedestrians, drivers and cyclists of Toronto, we are writing to express our strongest opposition to Bill 212 that will create more hazardous roads, increase air and noise pollution without solving the congestion problem the city faces. We also believe the proposed legislation is a direct assault on local democracy and governance as it rushes to conclusion before reasoning, and represents an unprecedented jurisdictional overreach into local affairs, particularly the largest, most diverse and financially important city in Ontario.\nRemoving bike lanes by legislation will increase congestion. The added construction will add travel time to both drivers and cyclists alike. Also, there is no data or evidence that supports that removing bike lanes on University, Yonge and Bloor will decrease driving time when a lot of the congestion is caused by construction and more cars on the road. It is also wasteful and fiscally irresponsible to spend taxpayer money to tear out newly constructed infrastructure.\nRemoving bike lanes is bad for business, particularly small businesses on the bike lanes that will bear the impact. This will lead to a loss of patrons as the roads are torn up. Additionally, as the Annex BIA stated, cyclists have more frequent and spontaneous stops along their route that will lead to more customers. Building the street as wide as possible for thoroughfare means more cars travelling through, not more business.\nCyclists and drivers will be endangered by the inevitable mixed traffic. Cyclists will always exist, whether you give them bike lanes or not. There will only be more cyclists as more people move to the large cities. Additionally, the principle of induced demand also means that simply by having an additional lane it will not necessarily lead to better travel times. This is particularly true as the legislation potentially forces more drivers onto the road because they have no alternative mode of transportation but to drive.\nCycling is part of the fabric of the transit system that will connect the last mile of transit use, especially considering how we have underinvested in subways and heavy rail transit in the past decades. While the historic investment into public transit by this government is laudable, it is also late. In any case, we still need micro mobility transport modes to connect transit users to their final destinations. With the booming population of Ontario and Toronto, more people are cycling not only to commute, but also to visit friends, families and businesses. The statistics of 1.2% of commuters being cyclists is misleading and outdated from 2011 when in fact we need more up to date statistics that encompasses all journeys, not just commuting. Particularly in large downtowns like that of Toronto, more density in housing and population simply means there is no room for everyone to drive for every trip. Cycling takes up less space and is more efficient at moving people in dense urban areas when we are facing an acute housing crisis. It seems folly to think devoting more space to roads is the solution to our population and housing problem when we simply do not have enough space for everyone to drive for every purpose.\nWe, the undersigned, implore you to pause Bill 212 that would make cities in Ontario, including Toronto, less competitive, livable and safe for all residents.\nSincerely,\n"

        "comment": "I do not support the proposal under Bill 212 to require municipalities to seek provincial approval for the implementation of new bike lanes that would remove an existing lane of traffic, require the Province to remove sections of specific bike lanes within the City of Toronto, and provide the Province with authority to establish a review process on existing bike lanes. I am disappointed in the provincial government for considering this approach, particularly in terms of its environmental and financial implications.\nPremier Ford has publicly declared, \u201cI believe in climate change, let's make that clear.\u201d It is undeniable that climate change is real, CO2 emissions and other greenhouse gas emissions contribute to climate change, and vehicle emissions are a large source of such emissions. In 2016, the Ontario government reported that more than one-third of Ontario\u2019s greenhouse gas pollution is caused by the transportation sector, with cars and trucks responsible for more than 70% of that total; see https://www.ontario.ca/page/climate-change-action-plan.\nIn light of this reality, the provincial government should be championing alternative transportation that reduces overall reliance on driving, and the necessary infrastructure that encourages members of the public to walk, bike, or take public transit where possible. Provincial officials have recognized the importance of \u201ctransit-oriented communities\u201d, and also \u201cfaster, greener and more reliable transportation.\u201d It is contrary to those public pronouncements for the Province to then turn around and propose the potential removal of bike lanes \u2013 crucial infrastructure that supports those faster, greener and more reliable transportation. Bike lanes do not cause congestion; cars and trucks create congestion.\nFrom what I have seen whenever I am in Toronto, bike lanes are critical for public safety. As someone who walks around in Toronto, I also have significant reservations that removing bike lanes would force cyclists to be on the roads dangerously or otherwise ride their bikes on sidewalks \u2013 which is dangerous for pedestrians. I also have seen drivers hit cyclists on roads without bike lanes, and ambulances even needing to be called in some circumstances. Having a separate lane for cyclists would reduce the frequency that those incidents happen. Even if you have disregard for public safety, reducing the frequency of those incidents likely would have overall net benefits for the drivers or vehicles on the road.\nThe proposal is also fiscally irresponsible. The bike lanes on Bloor Street West cost roughly $4.5 million to install, the new route along University Avenue cost $130,000 so far, and the bike lane along Yonge Street cost $3.8 million. It would cost much more to remove those bike lanes. The Province seemingly has not waited for traffic data from the City of Toronto, contrary to its commitment to wait for that data before making any decisions. The Province also has not indicated what \u201csecondary roads\u201d would be acceptable alternatives for bike lakes, and how those alternatives account for the same east-west traffic that Bloor Street West currently handles, or the north-south traffic on University of Yonge.\n"

Not only is the provincial government needlessly getting involved in a local matter, it seems it does not fully understand (nor is willing to communicate to the public) the apparent cause for traffic on bloor street west in Etobicoke. Today there are at least 8 sets of traffic lights between Humber river and Islington. Substantially increased density around Kipling and islington have resulted in a large increase in the local population compared to 5 years ago. Regardless of the number of lanes, there will not be an enormous benefit of removing bike lanes due to the increase of vehicles due to population and the slowed traffic from the controlled intersections. Today it was announced that average temperature this year is 1.5C above historic levels. As a cyclist, bike lanes through Etobicoke have made me feel safer and I now cycle to work at least once a week. I also cycle to bloor west and other shopping destinations. Removing bike lanes will either result in me slowing traffic in car lanes, or reducing my support of local business.\n"
