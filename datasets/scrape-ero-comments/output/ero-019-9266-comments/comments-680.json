Not only is it a complete waste of money to tear out these recently installed improvements to the cycling network, their removal will encourage congestion by encouraging car use in dense areas of the city where we should be encouraging alternate forms of transportation. When cycling in the city, I for one will be sharing the traffic lane with cars if the bike lanes are removed.\n"

        "comment": "This Bill puts in danger so many Toronto commuters who are not drivers. Bike lanes are essential to the safety of cyclists and pedestrians  and serves as critical infrastructure for the growing economy of bike food carriers. It infringes on the rights of these workers to a safe work environment and on the City of Toronto's jurisdiction to manage their own municipal traffic concerns. Bill 212 also dangerously ignores the research and expertise of urban planner who have conducted study's to show the counter: bike lanes reduce traffic congestion. The root cause of gridlock in the city is the amount of construction in the city. This Bill reflects the willed ignorance and spiteful governance of the Ford administration than it does reliable leadership.\n"

        "comment": "I cannot express how flabbergasted I am that this bill exists. With all the global evidence culled by formal research that proves cycling infrastructure helps BOTH non-drivers AND drivers and reduces gridlock, I am beyond perplexed by this government's decision to rip out valuable infrastructure.\nI am a homeowner in Toronto that uses every single form of transportation \u2013 walking, cycling, public transit, ride share, and personal driving \u2013 and without fail, no matter what mode I am using, I am given ample daily evidence that cycling infrastructure is not only vital, but road space reserved for parked and moving vehicles hinders it ALL.\nThis bill is punative toward non-drivers, and shows that giving precedent to cars ignores the very public danger that they present. Because cars and drivers have gotten more dangerous since traffic enforcement drastically reduced, I now cycle less, and am relieved my family does as well. Many of my friends experience the same thing. The daily heart attack endured by cycling just isn't worth it. So what happens instead? Often another car on the road, or no travel at all. So this means less engagement with neighbourhoods. If kowing to business interests is what this province wants to do, then it should realize that removing cycling infrastructure reduces spending in local business, not increases it. One just need look at programs and cities that have replaced car space for bikes. Not to mention to ecological cost of more cars on the road: more fossil fuel, more smog, more noise pollution in neighbourhoods\u2026\nI am just so angered by this bill, and the willful ignoring of actual scientific research around cycling and cities. What has happened to listening to actual evidence to make decisions? It's beyond reason.\nWhat I would like to know is how the province can qualify this bill. If there is ample ACTUAL proof that ripping out alternative travel infrastructure will help the issue, then so be it. But it doesn't exist, and yet here we all all, fighting ignorance. Make it make sense.\n"

We also, besides those who ride for recreation and or travel, work etc, have industries and employees who rely on bicycles, couriers, food  deliveries etc etc, those people will be having their lives put at risk with the removal of the lanes. Unless you ban bikes from the city they will be on the roads\n"

I live in downtown Toronto. I find very little reason to take a car, or taxi or a subway for most of my excursions. I revel in how vibrant and peopled the city has become since the addition of more bike lanes. And how much safer I feel riding. I am a senior and have been riding all my adult life. It would be short sighted to lose the gains we've made in alternate forms of travel, such as bike lanes, as opposed to gas guzzling vehicles. My riding does not pollute the air or increase climate change. I plan to live a long life because I know I'm getting exercise and am part of the fabric of this great city.\n"

Taking it the bike lanes is a waste of money that will make the lives of people who actually live in the city worse, just to appease those who live outside the city and drive in everyday.\nFurthermore, the environmental auditing of highway 413 that this bill is meant to skip is actually very important. It's wildly irresponsible to skip necessary research for civil projects like this.\n"

        "comment": "As a lifelong Torontonian, I strongly disapprove of the proposals in Bill 212 pertaining to removing and controlling bike lanes in the city. I am as frustrated by gridlock as anyone, but as has been voiced by multiple publicly available sources, there are many factors causing the issue, the least of which are bike lanes.\nConstruction is a massive disruption: better regulation on how and when building sites close lanes is needed. Uber and Lyft have swollen congestion by at least hundreds if not thousands of cars daily, which cruise the streets aimlessly, duplicating the role already filled by taxis.\nIt is clear the policy is not evidence-based, using out-dated, skewed data that does not reflect the reality of those of us living downtown.\nFurther, there is now a whole new and vital economy reliant on bikes: food delivery service. Thousands are earning a living on their bikes. To remove the infrastructure that increases the safety of those operating in this now baked-in part of the economy makes no sense.\nBeyond this, I object to the Bill on the principle of the overreach it represents. I voted in my city councillor to do precisely what the City of Toronto has done in this regard. I also value what council generally brings to the community as the elected officials with closest proximity to the realities on the ground here.\nIf the province worked collaboratively with the city, it would have more credibility with me.  This seems to me an offensive power play that palpably undermines democracy.\n"

It doesn\u2019t take a genius to realize that bikes take up far less room on the road than cars, and that the right way to combat congestion is to implement policies that encourage commuters to use alternative methods of transportation to the automobile.

I was in too many near-collisions to feel safe using it as my mode of transportation anymore. However, when the bike lanes got put in -- especially the Bloor lanes -- I started riding again, and cycling now once again serves as my main form of transportation.\nThe idea that this move by the Ford government, purely to curry political favour with suburban residents, would cost provincial taxpayers $48 million is outrageous.\nBike lanes help the environment, decrease deaths, and create community within our city leading to a more vibrant economy. It would be unconscionable to remove them against the City's will.\n"

These decisions surely should be left to the democratically elected representatives of the city?\nOn its merits, the bill seems uninformed and ill-conceived. It merely focuses on the convenience of automobile traffic within the city, as if this were the only relevant argument and nothing else matters.\nThe motion does not appear to be based on any data, just by some `gut feeling' that bike lanes are somehow responsible for gridlock.\nI've lived in the city for > 25 years, and can assure  you that traffic had been equally bad 20 years ago, probably worse.  The installation of bike lanes has been a huge improvement to this city -- taking this great city into the 21st century. Please let us not go back.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to share how disappointed I am to read about the contents of Bill 212 \u2013 Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act 2024.  I am disappointed as your government has until now prided itself of fact-based decision making, while the reasoning behind this bill suggests it is the opposite of evidence-based. I am a driver, an all-year cyclist and a pedestrian at different times. I live just south of Bloor in Toronto. The bike lanes near my home have greatly improved local transportation and the community in several ways:\n\u2022\tProviding different transportation options for people of all ages. (Priceless)\n\u2022\tGood for business: The evidence-based study based on credit card receipts revealed that the existence of the bike lanes on Bloor increased sales at local businesses on the street, which explains why Bloor-Annex Business Improvement Area has publicly come out strongly against bill 212.\n\u2022\tAffordability: Biking is affordable. Your government has until now made affordability a priority. Why the change of heart?\n\u2022\tFiscal responsibility: Removing the bike lanes would cost about 48$ million, as calculated by City of Toronto staff. It would tear up existing infrastructure. In addition to creating much more gridlock, it would be a waste of scarce public resources.\n\u2022\tSafety: As a taxpayer, I pay for the roads and other public spaces. I don\u2019t see why the province should prioritize some road users over others and prioritize the physical safety of some road users over others. I find it particularly cruel to pit the minutes saved for some against the physical safety of vulnerable road users.\n\u2022\tRemoving the bike lanes would not improve traffic. As a landmark 2009 study in the American Economic Review showed, when road capacity increases by 1 percent in a metropolitan area, the number of cars on the road also increases by 1 percent. Providing other transportation options such as bike lanes, such as improved transit will reduce gridlock.\nI would strongly encourage you to reconsider the premise behind this bill and return to evidence-based decision making. Thank you for your consideration.\n"
