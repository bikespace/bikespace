Bike lanes are absolutely required for the safety of local residents that use it to make many local-area trips.  I used to bike in the area before the bikelanes were installed and at times it would be frightening in some areas, especially with aggressive drivers.  With increase in traffic from year to year, there has also been a noticeable increase in aggressive driving in general.  Removing bike lanes might help with vehicular traffic, but will only lower the quality of life for many residents local residents.\n"

        "comment": "Just an absolute disgrace.\nI\u2019m not even a cyclist, but a few things I\u2019ve noticed:\n1) the bike lanes are already there and it would cost taxpayers millions of dollars to remove them\n2) removing them will cause even more congestion especially knowing how swiftly road work gets done in Toronto\n3) bike lanes are safe designated areas for people who don\u2019t drive, whether due to financial reasons or not\n4) the bike lanes force people to drive more cautiously because they can\u2019t try to weave in and out of lanes considering the right lane was always full of parked cars anyway\n5) bike lanes make the city more vibrant and inviting, thus driving up foot traffic for small businesses\nThese are just a few reasons that demonstrate that Ford has no idea what it\u2019s like to live among the people (and this is only regarding bike lanes!).\nEnd this proposal. Leave the bike lanes. Move on to a different sociopathic idea that hurts the middle class and its future generations.\n"

        "comment": "My family and I frequently use the Bloor and University bike lanes. Removing them makes biking less safe and will not help traffic. There is no data showing that bike lanes negatively impact traffic - they help take cars off the streets. Climate change is a existential threat to our society and we need to encourage the reduction of carbon emissions, rather than tearing out infrastructure that supports the safe use of alternative modes of of transportation.\n"

        "comment": "I am strongly opposed to the passage of Bill 212. As climate change and population growth explode we must have alternatives to private automobile transportation for Torontonians. Bicycle use is a simple, affordable  alternative, with many health  benefits, and is increasingly adopted by cities across the world, from Copenhagen and Amsterdam to Paris and New York.\nThe City of Toronto, the Assocation of Municipalities of Ontario, Ontario Professional Planners Institute, Ontario Society of Professional Engineers, and Ontario Traffic Council have all come out against Bill 212.\nThe statistics used by the Provincial government regarding numbers of riders are innacurate and misleading (rather than 1.2%; 10% of trips ending in downtown Toronto are taken by bike or other micromobility options.) People are recognizing bike travel to be an easy alternative to car use, and are voting with their \"wheels\" as we see bike use accelerating.\nIdeally bike lanes are not placed on major arterial roads, but in the case of Bloor Street, College Street, and University Avenue there are no feasible alternatives.\nPeople, including families with children, will continue to use roads should bike lanes be removed, and the result will be more conflict between cars and bikes, and increasing injuries and in some cases death, of bike riders.\nToronto traffic congestion is not caused by bike lanes. Teh city and province need multi pronged approaches including better public transport to help manage this. Removing bike lanes is dangerous, antiquated planning, will not solve congestion, and will put lives at risk. I urge the government to  withdraw this bill.\n"

        "comment": "I\u2019m really concerned about the province\u2019s plan to remove existing bike lines and set up the framework to interfere with building new ones. This does not respect the democratic self-governance of Toronto, is harmful to the environment and will lead to an increase in severe injuries and death. Why is the province trying to regress in this way? The government says it\u2019s to reduce gridlock, but this cannot be true. Improving and enabling modes of transport that are not driving is what takes cars of the road and actually improves gridlock. The cars aren\u2019t going anywhere if people don\u2019t have good alternatives. Cycling is one of those. It\u2019s great for the environment (unlike cars), space efficient (unlike cars), and accessible to young people (unlike cars). Without bike lanes, though, it\u2019s not as safe an option. This matters immensely. My husband was just yesterday hit by a car while riding his bike. He\u2019s lucky to be alive. The cars in this city are aggressive and bike lanes literally save lives. And as cycling becomes a safer option, more people use it! Everyone (including drivers) benefits from this due to how cycling reduces congestion, reduces pollution and expands mobility. Imagine if kids could safely ride their bikes around the city because of a great bike lane network? To remove bike lanes from such major streets in the city is so irresponsible. Not everyone can drive or afford a car and people will continue to bike with or without bikes lanes. Knowing this fact, the province is making the choice to let more people die by removing bike lanes and hindering building new ones. That brings me to another key point - Toronto voted for bike lanes. We live here, we want them, our mayor supports them. It is completely inappropriate and un democratic for the province to force its will, especially to remove something positive. Removing them will also cost the city over $40 million dollars. All to make cycling less safe and make no difference at all to congestion. This Bill is shameful, and dangerous. Do better for the people who live here.\n"

        "comment": "In all of the discussions about bike lanes, the government is forgetting that it is not just about the lanes but about the people and their SAFETY in using the lanes. By removing the lanes you are failing to protect people and creating a second class of Ontarians where motorist convenience is more important than the safety of cyclists. I have been cycling for 40 years and have had a number of mishaps. None of them while using the lanes.\nEven if individuals do not cycle themselves. Surely they have children, grandchildren, or friends who cycle and who they would want keep safe. My daughter's friend Alexandra Amaro died cycling on Dufferin Street. A bike lane might have protected her.\nPlease do not fail some of the population for the convenience and impatience of others. The huge cost of removing bike lanes would be better spent on investing in public transit so there would be fewer cars with one driver in each car.\nBike lanes do not cause gridlock. Too many cars with single drivers and no passengers do.\n"

        "comment": "It\u2019s incredibly irresponsible use of public funding to take out investments of public funds.\nIt is an overstep and micromanagement of a city when the province has its own issues to focus on of greater importance. Like properly funding transit, healthcare, education, and supporting local businesses.\nFurther data demonstrates the improvement of traffic and vitality of local businesses when bike lanes exist.\nSafety is improved for cyclists, drivers, and healthcare responders. These all impact a reduction in burden on other publicly funded services.\nFocusing only on certain roads in Toronto also has no impact on the province as a whole and seems politically motivated to address specific insider issues or those with close connection to government as opposed to solving actual problems Ontarians are facing\n"

        "comment": "Thank you so much for stepping in and addressing the bike lane situation particularily on Bloor St West. I live and work nearby the Kingsway and frequently go to Bloor West Village.  The bike lanes have reduced parking, increased parking fees and I am sure have affected businesses in both of these communities.  Also but maybe not as important is they are an eyesore to previously vibrant & interesting areas.  Businesses pay a lot of taxes so reduction to access for even short term parking makes them suffer unnecessarily.  I do not think that bike lanes help the environment.  Cars now have to idol longer waiting for the street lights to turn green.  Worse now I see people and kids on those electric skate boards using the bike lanes and they whip out of nowhere. They are silent and are putting themselves at risk of being hit.  I also have seen joggers use the bike lanes.  So many cyclists do not respect the red light rules and go through red lights.  The number of cyclists are outnumbered by the thousands of cars.  We as a city and province do have to look to the future in expanding traffic and commerce.  But we need to do so with common sense.\nThank you for listening to my comments.\n"

Cycling and other forms of micro transport are growing and this move will work to make this form of transport less feasible. Put the money you would use to get rid of bike lanes to use buying more electric buses and drivers , increase subway service, put tolls on the 401and qew . Make car travel less attractive and public transit the gold standard . This will be much more effective in reducing gridlock than getting rid of bike lanes . It takes some courage , Does your government have it ?.\n"

        "comment": "Why is the provincial government involving itself in municipal affairs to a degree that it undermines the local decisions made by civic leaders elected by city residents?\nBike lanes are decided by elected officials at city hall. Monies for bike lanes are from municipal funds. The province has jurisdiction over the highways. The province should help fund transit services and bike lanes in cities. Look to Europe and how their urban plans to reduce traffic congestion, improve air quality and keep their citizens moving (cycling, walking) which improves mental and physical well-being. All this produce positive outcomes for health and environment.\nThe proposal to remove the bike lanes in Toronto is a waste of money - for what was already spent and to change the infrastructure back for cars.\n"

        "comment": "I recently fell of my bike in the bike lane on Bloor Street West in Toronto to avoid a vehicle that suddenly pulled over in front of me in the bike lane. Had I not fallen inside the bike lane or veered into the live vehicle lane I would have been run over by a car behind me. This bike lane saved my life.\nIn November 2017, our current Premier (Doug Ford) maid the following statement on an episode of TVO\u2019s Political Blind Date about his experience riding a bike in Toronto. \u201cYou\u2019re nervous when there\u2019s no bike lanes. At least I was. We have to do everything we can to make sure three\u2019s never a death in the city. One death is way too many when it comes to bicycle riders.\u201d  Doug Ford TVO, 2017.    He was elected as Ontario\u2019s Premier 7 months later in June 2018.\nPlease, let\u2019s not enact Bill 212 as it will put people's lives at risk for a vehicle congestion problem not created by the presence of bike infrastructure. The overwhelming amount of congestion that takes place is Ontario is on the peripheries of the City Toronto, 400 series highways and the extremely vast and sprawling suburbs of the Greater Toronto Area where bike lanes are not present and people are forced to drive due to lack of safe, frequent and reliable transportation options. Expanding road and highway capacity for cars only induces demand for car trips making congestion much worse than it was prior to expanding road and highway capacity.  The last 60 years of extensive road and highway expansion in the GTA has led to a diminished quality of life for Ontarians and will continue to do so long into the future if Bill 212, 2024 becomes formal legislation. I am strongly opposed to Bill 212, 2024 and ask that it be thrown out.\nThank you kindly.\n"

Nonetheless, it is clear to me that bike lanes make our cities safer, more efficient and more pleasant. I prefer traveling on streets with bike lanes, no matter my mode of transportation.\nForcing a city that did not elect you to remove bike lanes against the will of its citizens is undemocratic. It will lead to fewer people cycling, more cars, slower traffic and, ultimately, deaths due to unsafe infrastructure.\nFurther, the portions of this bill focused on highway 413 are unnecessary. We have environmental reviews and rights associated with expropriation for a reason.\nThis bill should be withdrawn in its entirety.\n"
