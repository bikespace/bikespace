        "comment": "There are so many things wrong with this bill:\nBike lane reduces traffic, not the other way around. Removing bike lanes will force cyclists to start using cars, leading to more congestions.\nThe ones who can\u2019t use cars will be forced to share road with drivers, leading to accidents and potential deaths. We already have so many death this year to due this exact issue.\nRemoving bike lane limit people\u2019s choice of freedom to choose their transportation methods. This is also worse for the environment as biking is one of the most green transportation options we have today\nThe Ontario gov also spent money (that they don\u2019t have) to remove already established lanes, ignoring issue of other pressing ones like health care and housing\nPlease please revise this bill. We want the best for Ontarians, and this benefits no one.\n"

        "comment": "As someone who has lived near Bloor Street in the High Park area, I have personally seen the effects of separated bike lanes.  In short, Bloor Street has improved immensely since their introduction.\nBefore the bike lanes were introduced, Bloor Street was a mess and didn't serve motorists, cyclists or pedestrians well.  As a motorist, I avoided Bloor for east-west travel.  Now I use it on a regular basis.  I also did not cycle on Bloor and discouraged others from doing so.  Now I use it regularly to cycle to Bloor West Village instead of driving.  Finally, the street is now safer for pedestrians than in the past.  It is easier and safer to cross mid block with just two lanes to cross rather than four.\nRemoving the bike lanes on Bloor will be a retrograde step and shameful for both Toronto and Ontario.\nI have only driven on University since the bike lanes were introduced but they appear to have a similar positive affect on the street.  It is the other construction work on University that is causing congestion and certainly not the bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "This is terrible. We should be saving our money and reducing our environmental impact by keeping these lanes. Instead, spend the money earmarked for removal on speeding up public transit construction, and you'll significantly reduce traffic for your suburban voters while winning support from city residents.\n"

        "comment": "Taking out the bike lanes that were just installed - this is NOT a good idea. The Ford government needs to listen to science, studies, facts, and professionals.\nThe City of Toronto has dedicated teams of urban planning professionals, transit professionals, and city departments who have devoted years of study and time and best practices when making decisions in how our city should be run. They work together and have put in a lot of hard work and coordination to make the city a better place. The result of a lot of this work was to enhance our city with bike lanes to elevate Toronto. The installation of the bike lanes was clearly done to meet city goals such as vision zero, safety, environment, giving people transportation options, and moving more people through existing streets. We see this kind of success in many cities like Montreal, Paris, Amsterdam, etc.\nThe studies and 'science' support this. The recent surveys shows that most people think that vehicle traffic can be improved if construction projects were adjusted - not via the removal of bike lanes.\nThe Ford government needs to listen to the people of Toronto and/or open their eyes and observe streets that do NOT have any bike lanes at all - e.g. Keele street at Dundas. There are zero bike lanes and yet Keele is always backed up. This is because of car traffic - there are too many cars and the moment a car is parked, parking, picking up or dropping off Ubers or packages or food, or turning left, or turning right, then the whole lane starts to back up. This type of traffic frustration is already an existing phenomenon - way before bike lanes were put in. Bloor street was always busy way before the bike lanes were put in - it was always terrible to drive on. Taking out the bike lanes will not make it any better.\nThe bike counters and bike data show that more and more people are using them. The bike share network has grown and is reaching new highs of usage each year. All levels of government need to listen to the facts - but especially the Ford provincial government. In a few years, you will see that more and more people will be using the bike lanes.\nIf the Ford government really wanted to help alleviate the car traffic problem, then they need to put in car congestion pricing and to toll the highways. These are case studies done around the world on this (e.g. London UK, and most recently NYC did a lot of planning in preparation for it). They need the monies to help pay for the delayed LRT lines and highways anyways (not to mention the underfunded TTC...).\n"

        "comment": "Our focus should be to move PEOPLE faster, not move drivers faster. Everyone deserves to get to where they need to be quickly, safely, and in an affordable manner. That\u2019s not going to be accomplished by driving, and certainly not my highways. Although necessary in rural/remote parts of the province, highways are the most expensive, most harmful, and least efficient way to move people. If this government cared about reducing gridlock, we\u2019d be trying to get as many cars off the road as possible by building valid alternatives like better mass transit. Then, only those who need to drive will be driving and they will find themselves enjoying much less gridlock with the rest of us out of the way.\nCities around the world have finally caught onto what the Dutch and Nordic countries learned decades ago: bike lanes save lives, improve traffic, improve public health, increase community engagement, are good for the economy, and are good for the environment. We need more bike lanes, not fewer. Bike lanes along important arterial roads are important if cycling is to be a valid mode of transportation. If you needed to get to work, are you going to take the main roads that get you there directly or are you going to meander through side streets? Business on Yonge and Bloor especially have not only saved lives, they\u2019ve increased the number of customers that visit the businesses there. These lanes are frequently used, and I know many people who have given up driving in favour of cycling now that it is so safe and convenient. Removing these lanes will remove this good work. The locally owned business that rely on the customers those bike lanes bring in to pay Toronto\u2019s sky high rent will suffer. Hospitals benefit greatly from the University lanes, as fewer cars means less exhaust and vehicle noise in an area where people are at their most vulnerable health state. Plus, ambulances use side streets around the hospitals to access the ER, not University. Removing the lanes on University will have a dire impact on sick people and hospital access. EMS has never stated that the bike lanes in University impede their work.\nUltimately, the province is proposing to use provincial taxpayer money to destroy the economic, environmental, social, and health benefits enjoyed by residents in a single city. Not only is removing bike lanes moving every impacted area backwards, it is a massive misuse of funds that should be going to provincial issues. The money spent on removing bike lanes would be much better spent on housing, healthcare, and education for EVERYONE in Ontario. Let cities deal with municipal issues. Stay in your lane.\n"

        "comment": "I\u2019m commenting because I strongly oppose this proposal.\nBike lanes saves lives. The roads that have them move smoothly, the bike lanes increase revenues for small businesses. I drive in this city and I much prefer cyclists being kept separate from cars as much as possible on our roads. Removing them will not get rid of cyclists it'll just make our roads more dangerous for them\nAs an Ontarian, I support keeping the current bike lanes on Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue - and I strongly urge Premier Ford and his government to continue to let the city of Toronto keep their authority in determining the approval process for bike lanes.\nWe need more bike lanes - not less.\n\"We have to do everything we can to make sure there\u2019s never a death in the city. One death is way too many when it comes to bicycle riders. We have to make sure that they\u2019re safe.\"\n-  The Premier in 2017 on TVO's Political Blind Date.\n"

This allows all traffic, yes including cars, to flow more freely. Removing the lanes will simply push these cyclists into the general traffic where they will now impede the faster moving motor vehicles. What an absolute waste of taxpayer money. For shame.\n"

        "comment": "There are dozens of bike lane studies, from Toronto and around the world.  Not a single one reports cars congestion, quite the opposite.   You found your cudgel and will keep at it in spite of no data indicating bikes cause congestion, anywhere, on earth.\nYou mention \"small business\" in your reason yet it is small business that have directly benefited from having repeat customers, that spend more, and live locally.  It's the bikes not the cars that drive economic vitality along Bloor Street.  You can't prove anything of what you're saying about small business either.\nhttps://www.tcat.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Bike-Lanes-On-Street-Par\u2026\nPlease refute the following.  72% of visitors arrive by bike or walking.  Only 4% by car.\nMerchants overestimate the number of their customers who arrive by car.\nIf there was a complaint it was that there wasn't enough bicycle parking!\nIn this report from 2016 it also quotes other studies also showing the benefits of bike lanes.\nCongestion equals Cars.  UK London has a congestion tax, and it's for cars.  Paris London and the great success of The Netherlands to name a few have all benefited from reducing cars and embracing bike lanes.  Only Ontario we are going backwards.  It is wrong and has no reason other than spite against the city because Toronto said no to Ford.\nFord cut city council in half in 2018.  Might as well cut the other half as Ford will never be mayor of Toronto.  Ever.  Make us some regional entity including the other cities in the Golden Horseshoe.  But can we stop pretending you are doing anything other than revenge?\n"

        "comment": "This bill is an absurd overreach, backed by zero actual data. Cyclists on these roads will still use a vehicle lane, only with no safety infrastructure so the only impact will be increased cyclist injuries and fatalities. Based on the Premier\u2019s hesitancy to force municipalities to allow for fourplexes, I was under the impression that he didn\u2019t want to meddle in municipal affairs. Apparently this principle only applies selectively. This bill would be a shame, and will rip out needed infrastructure and lead to increases in injuries and deaths. Please reconsider, or better yet, remove the parking lanes on Bloor for additional traffic lanes.\n"

Such an action would br a public policy, economic, and environmental disaster. We already know investment in more modes of transport benefits everyone and this work of installing bike lanes has already been done. Give it time to work. The government action should be stopped.
