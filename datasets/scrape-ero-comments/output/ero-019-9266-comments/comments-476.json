        "comment": "Bicycles don't cause congestion, cars cause congestion. To reduce congestion, get cars off the road, not bicycles.\nI enjoy walking.  There are places I won't walk, because I am afraid of being run over by a bicycle coming up silently behind me.  Since a bicycle lane was added to the bridge near my house, I have felt comfortable crossing it on foot without worrying about being startled and jumping into the water on one side or the traffic on the other.\n"

        "comment": "I live at Spadina and Bloor and regularly drive and bike on the roads that are being targeted by Bill 212. Every morning I drive along Bloor at the start of rush hour to drop my dog at at her daycare, park on the street with municipal parking, drive home, and then bike to work along Bloor and University. I have never found that the bike lines have impeded my commute or prevented my parking. None of these streets have ever had the amount of traffic I have experienced in other places in the city, for example, Eglinton around the entrance to the Allan. As a driver, it helps me feel less likely to hit a cyclist, as they are in their own lanes and I don't have to be constantly watching to make sure they aren't in my blind spots. As a cyclist, it makes me feel safer to be able to bike to work without constant fear of being hit by a car. I cannot drive to work because the parking would be too expensive, and the bike provides me with exercise and fresh air, and means there is one less car on the street causing congestion at rush hour. The more people feel enabled and safe to bike to work, the less traffic there will be.\nThe absolute waste of provincial money and resources this represents, especially with regard to the University bike lanes which are brand new, is egregious. The traffic that will be caused by tearing up streets that were newly renovated is also a disgrace. This is a vast and irresponsible overreach on the part of the provincial government.\n"

        "comment": "I am against Bill 212 as it will not reduce gridlock. Removing any bike lane is a regressive action that will result in injuries and death of people who cycle.\nThere is no evidence showing that removing bike lanes will reduce traffic. Cities around the world are installing bike lanes and networks that is reducing pollution, traffic, and crashes. You dont even have to look far, Montreal is a leader in North America and has a bike network on major roads across the city which is not resulting in congestion.\nThis is a dangerous bill with no evidence to back up its goal.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike infrastructure is the dumbest idea ever. It is proven that additional car infrastructure just brings more cars resulting in no change to gridlock. Bike lanes and transit are the real solutions to gridlock.\nMake safe routes for cyclists and they will use them. Safe routes means you have a network to get from point a to b with designated lanes from quiet residential streets. High volume areas separated from cars. Winter maintenance performed. Cities in Finland can do this why can\u2019t we? Cities with proper infrastructure have high percentage of population using bikes. Don\u2019t blame lack of cyclists on nobody wanting to commute by bike but blame it on the lack of proper infrastructure. I get asked regularly if I feel SAFE as the person is interested in cycling but feels uncomfortable riding in traffic.\nTraffic light signalling improvements are also required. We have areas where we need three stage lights. Pedestrian, bike, and car. Give everyone a chance to get through the intersection. Cities such as Copenhagen have done so for decades.\nArguments that these are \u201csmall\u201d countries without the vast area of Canada do not apply to GTA. Urban is urban. Not to mention the goals of higher density for more housing.\nCompare passenger density for cars and bikes. Compare person to vehicle ratio of bikes to cars. Maybe cars average 2 people. What is the area a vehicle covers? What are the safety margins around the car? Now take that space and fill it with cyclists on their bikes. We just increased  transportation density by a factor of at least three. And when considering SUVs likely 5x.\nCars are not a great option for efficient transportation. Cars are an excellent option for some situations but certainly not for urban areas. Car use should be discouraged in urban areas with other options readily available. Transit and bikes are two great options.\nDiscourage car use in gridlock prone urbane areas by making them more restrictive to cars. Zones where cars are not permitted at all times. Passes for residents, visitors, commercial traffic. Times of day. Passenger count. Those are a couple of thoughts on zone restrictions to reduce car volume.\nI have seen cyclists increase dramatically where they have a safe route. I have cycled year round for a 4km one way commute. I have been an urban cyclist living in Toronto for more than two decades. When I started I had far fewer fellow cyclists. Now, my main route can feel like it has too many cyclists on it. But that is just me being selfish. My bike trip in the city on a typical day is still much faster than taking my car (yes, I DO own a car), just a little slower when I need to slow down for less experienced cyclists who are out there DUE to a safer bike lane.\nBonus points for Idaho stop, education programs for cyclists, and fining both motorists and cyclists who drive dangerously.\n"

        "comment": "As an Ontario resident, I commuted everywhere by biked during the 8 years I lived in Toronto and now I'm doing the same living in Ottawa.\nI witnessed first hand how dangerous Toronto commuting was before the current bike lanes were put in place and how their installation made biking more safe and popular. Going back and ripping out those valuable pieces of infrastructure (built with our taxpayer money!) simply doesn't make sense, to name a few reasons:\n- Every bike on the road is one less car - helping alleviate gridlock\n\t- Safe bike infrastructure means fewer accidents - which alone is a good enough reason, but it also means less pressure on our already stretched first responders and healthcare system\n\t- More bikes on roads means less air and noise pollution\n\t- More exercise means better mental and physical health - which once again reduces the load on the healthcare system\nFurthermore, I believe traffic management and road planning is best handled by the municipality where much more local data can be collected and scrutiny applied. City traffic planners are in the best place to decide when and where to install bike lanes.\nFor these reasons, I oppose Bill 212.\n"

Gridlock and safety should be the main concerns.\nPerhaps if bicycles required a license and insurance, they would cycle more responsibly.  Bicycles and other non-insured apparatus who use the roads should pay appropriate insurance and follow the rules of the road.\n"

The city is safer because of them and I worry for the dire consequences of removing them. The province should recognize alternatives to driving as an absolutely necessary part in addressing congestion in the city and should be encouraging individuals to use alternatives instead of adding more single occupancy vehicles to the road and focusing on drivers. Please reevaluate your priorities and recognize cycling as an excellent way to commute (healthier!), not to mention that it is eco-friendly and cost effective. Please do not take away cycling infrastructure. People will be seriously injured and die without bike lanes.\n"

Removing bike lanes is dangerous for cyclists and also for drivers who are more distracted than ever and share the road badly.\n3. Research has repeatedly shown that widening roads makes congestion worse: add a lane= add more cars.\n4. Its not just about bike safety but about the environment. we need to move ALL people towards more sustainable transportation whether it be bus/train/subway/bikes/walking. THAT is the long term goal and solution. I appreciate not everyone CAN do that but the majority of workers could with better infrastructure.\n5.

        "comment": "I strongly oppose this proposed bill, which represents an overreach by the province into municipal governance. Resources\u2014both financial and temporal\u2014should be directed toward improving infrastructure for pedestrians, cyclists, and public transit users, not toward maintaining outdated, environmentally harmful, and unsustainable car-centric systems. If you look at any developed metropolitan area outside of North America, it's clear that building livable, sustainable communities requires shifting focus away from car dependency toward more inclusive, alternative modes of transportation.\nI live in the Tri-City area (Kitchener, Waterloo, Cambridge) where significant efforts have been made to enhance walkability and bikeability across the region. People are willing to choose alternative forms of transportation when they are safe, affordable, and accessible. In fact, many are already using newly developed bike lanes, not just for recreation but for daily commuting. So why is the Ford government seeking to undermine this progress? This bill is short-sighted and will have serious negative consequences on the growth and economic prosperity of Ontario's communities.\nThe province should stick to its own jurisdiction and stay out of municipal affairs.\n"
