Use the GO train and take my bike into Toronto with large groups of friends going with us.\nA total fallacy to believe more car lanes will bring less traffic.  Give people better options to travel, to discourage car use.  Better bike lanes may actually encourage others to get out of their cars. Better for health care costs too!  Cleaner and safer public transit may do the same!\nMost big cities are looking to improve livability in their cities not adding more car lanes!\nThis is no longer the era of the car.\nMr Ford could encourage his council to travel more by bike and public transit too. Good for his health too!\n"

        "comment": "The proposal is deeply flawed for the following reasons:\n- the proposal represents a significant overreach of provincial responsibility, targeted at a single community in the province. It's notable that both the city of Toronto and the Association of Municipalities of Ontario (AMO) have expressed opposition to this proposal.\n- The roadways under consideration (including Bloor Street, Yonge Street and University Avenue) are the responsibility of the City of Toronto. As the custodian of these routes, the city has conducted extensive consultations to assess the magnitude of the addition of bike lanes (and the corresponding reduction of car/truck lanes). The city has also shown its willingness to make adjustments to the traffic flow to facilitate movement for all users (cars, trucks, bicycles, etc.).\n- while provincial representatives make reference to having data to make decisions, they ignore the consultation work done above and the data collected following the change. They are also ignoring comments from the local community (e.g., the Bloor-Annex BIA) on the positive aspects of having the bike lanes in their neighbourhood. Data presented in support of this proposal tends to be anecdotal in nature and has been disproved through the collection of data from the streets with implemented bike lanes.\n- a key piece of data that does not appear in the provincial proposals is one of public safety. Cyclists will use these streets whether there are reserved lanes for cyclists or not. If the lanes are not present, cyclists will be at increased risk due to vehicular traffic. In addition, a cyclist may legitimately take space in a vehicular lane to improve their own safety situation, which will ultimately increase, rather than decrease congestion.\n- the provincial proposal suggests that secondary roads be used as options for bike lanes, yet provides no guidance on the criteria for secondary routes. It is not unreasonable to foresee circumstances where shifting bike lanes to a secondary route (for example, Dupont, rather than Bloor) will generate similar issues. Does the province then mandate that Dupont is a primary route and push the bike lane to a more distant and potentially less direct route?\nAs an aside, the province has the means under its purview to produce significant improvements in traffic flow if it implements the Crosstown, Finch LRT, Mississauga Huron-Ontario and (future) Ontario Line. There is no need for additional legislation to do this and the impact will be far greater and with minimal disruption and risk to the cycling community.\n"

        "comment": "The proposed legislation undermines the goal that it seeks to accomplish. The goal of easing congestion is accomplished by increasing access to different modes of transportation other than motor vehicles. Removing bicycle lanes will add to congestion by incentivizing more commuters to drive cars, or to take the TTC. The result is more congested streets, more crowded subway cars, and (most importantly) more car-bicycle accidents. From the perspective of car commuters, the cyclists who continue to use the roads will just end up slowing down traffic by sharing the lane with motor vehicles.\nWith these considerations in mind, it is clear to me, and any thinking person, that the proposed bill is asinine. It simply flies in the face of any clear considered judgments about how to make commuting more efficient and safe.\n"

        "comment": "I just want to voice my absolute disapproval for this piece of legislation, here are my thoughts and some proposed solutions to our ongoing transportation issues in this province.\n1.\tThe Fundamental Premise of the Bill is Deeply Flawed.\nIn its preamble, the government claims the bill aims to \"fight gridlock and get drivers where they need to go faster.\" This approach is misguided for several reasons. First, the focus should not be solely on speeding up vehicle travel, but rather on ensuring that people can reach their destinations more efficiently. Moreover, if this legislation were rooted in sound transportation principles, it would acknowledge that simply building more highways or adding vehicle lanes does not effectively address traffic congestion.\nThe primary cause of urban congestion in Ontario is the prevalence of low-density, car-centric sprawl. A well-informed policy would recognize this reality and advocate for a regional strategy that embraces multi-modal transportation options to reduce the number of vehicle trips made. At the provincial level, this should involve coordinated inter-regional planning that aligns regional growth with public transit, active transportation, and, when absolutely necessary, limited vehicle access for delivery and utility work. (ie use cars only when absolutely necessary).\nThe idea that expediting highway development through farmland, eliminating bike lanes, and reducing active transportation infrastructure is not only misguided but also a significant misallocation of time and resources. I strongly urge you to reconsider this approach.\n2.\t Micromanaging Local Issues is a Misallocation of Ministerial Resources\nThe idea of the Minister micro-managing local transportation issues, such as bicycle lanes, is not only an inefficient use of time and resources but also undermines the government\u2019s goal of reducing red tape by adding unnecessary layers of infrastructure approvals.\nLocal planning decisions of this nature are best left to municipalities, which have a deeper understanding of their communities' needs. Rather than targeting one of the viable solutions to gridlock\u2014like bicycle lanes\u2014we need the Minister to focus on coordinating growth and transit plans between municipalities. This includes ensuring that active transportation and public transit corridors are integrated into future growth plans and that there is effective infrastructure coordination across municipal boundaries on a macro-scale.\n3.\tWaste of Taxpayers Time and Money\nIt appears that the Premier and Minister have already decided to eliminate several fully constructed cycling infrastructure projects in Toronto, including the lanes on Bloor, University, and Yonge Streets. These projects, which cost taxpayers millions of dollars, are now under threat just as they have been completed. The proposed removals come with an uncertain cost and an unknown timeline for construction.\nWe urge you not to waste our time or subject us to months of gridlock while dismantling vital infrastructure. Let\u2019s prioritize effective solutions that benefit our community instead.\n4.\tPlease focus on safety and effectiveness:\nThis proposal will place bicycles directly in traffic, potentially worsening the very issues it aims to address. Not only does this jeopardize the safety of Ontarians, but it fails to provide a viable solution to the problem at hand. Please focus on actual solutions to fix our transport problems.\nFor example consider the following:\na.\tRemove On-Street Parking in Priority Corridors\nIf right-of-way real estate is a concern, consider implementing growth bonuses and provincial design standards to address a significant inefficiency in our corridors: on-street parking. Removing parking would free up space for two travel lanes, as well as wider, grade-separated bike lanes and improved public realm features that can enhance local real estate values and stimulate commerce.\nb.\tIntegrated Regional Transit Planning:\nDevelop a comprehensive regional transit strategy that connects multiple municipalities, prioritizing the creation of reliable, frequent, and affordable public transit options\u2014such as buses and light rail\u2014that link urban centers with suburban areas. Additionally, allow passengers to bring their bicycles on inter-regional transit to facilitate the first and last few kilometers of their journey. By enhancing transit accessibility, we can reduce dependence on personal vehicles, thereby alleviating congestion and curbing urban sprawl.\nc.\tIncentivize Mixed-Use Development:\nEncourage municipalities to adopt zoning policies that promote mixed-use developments. This approach combines residential, commercial, and recreational spaces within walkable neighborhoods, reducing the need for long commutes and fostering vibrant communities. Incentives, such as tax breaks or grants for developers, can help facilitate these projects and combat urban sprawl.\nd.\tImplement Congestion Pricing:\nIntroduce congestion pricing in heavily trafficked areas to manage demand during peak hours. By charging a fee for driving in certain zones during high-traffic times, we can encourage commuters to use public transit, carpool, or shift their travel times. The revenue generated can be reinvested into transportation infrastructure and public transit enhancements, further improving mobility and reducing congestion.\ne.\tUse What We\u2019ve Got:\nBefore moving forward with plans to construct a billion-dollar highway over the GTA, we must address one of the most significant public infrastructure failures in Ontario\u2019s history: the under-utilization of Highway 407. Instead of promoting widespread sprawl, we should incentivize its use for cargo and commercial vehicles. If we do need to build a new east-west corridor, let\u2019s focus on enhancing inter-regional transit by developing a circulator route for Metrolinx, rather than adding more highways.\n"

        "comment": "I have lived in Toronto since 2019 and worked here since 2008. I have and still use bikes for transportation to and from work, restaurants, cinemas and parks. I have enjoyed specifically the bike lanes on Richmond, Adelaide, University, College, Shuter, Lakeshore, Bloor and countless others as well. I vehemently support building public transit infrastructure such as dedicated streetcar or bus lanes and bike lanes - in my view they are public transit infrastructure. To summarize, I think this bill should be rejected because;\n1) Biking lanes are essential public transit infrastructure and can provide added accessibility to transit stations. From Shuter/River st, I would bike to Yonge across Shuter and then take the subway to Fairview mall for work occasionally.\n2) Bike lanes can provide higher visibility to smaller businesses. I have numerous times been biking on queen street and would stop to grab a doubles or a patty at Ochos or a slice at badaalis. These are not things I have done in a car as that spontaneity to be able to stop and explore can't be afforded to every car otherwise we have traffic jams.\nI recommend to reject voting for this Bill,\nRegent Park constituent\n"

WHY would the government create MORE construction chaos in the downtown core? Construction is the #1 cause of congestion, and the government is proposing to create more of it. Completely senseless.\nThe bike lanes the government is proposing to remove would not even add additional lanes of traffic. The lanes on Bloor and Yonge Streets largely replaced on-street parking, not live lanes of traffic. If the government seriously is concerned about congestion, why don't they remove more street parking to create more lanes?\nThe lanes on University removed a lane of traffic, but that is only because it is an extremely wide boulevard that is massively over-engineered for the amount of traffic. Has the government even looked at the road? Or do they just act blindly without evidence? University is almost never congested, even with the bike lanes in place. There are still two live lanes of traffic and a full lane for street parking and stopping for emergency vehicles. This is a solution in search of a problem.\nBike lanes REDUCE congestion by getting people out of cars and onto bikes which are a more efficient use of road space. CARS CAUSE CONGESTION, NOT BIKES!\nDozens of people have died on Toronto streets due to unsafe roads for cyclists and pedestrians. This move will only ensure that more people will die senselessly. Stop this nonsense and focus on things that matter! Fixing our healthcare, improving our education, getting public transit built (when is the Eglinton LRT going to open??????????????) Stop meddling in the affairs of municipalities who know far better than you do, how to manage roads. STAY IN YOUR LANE!\n"

This bill will make my day to day commute worse with nothing to show for better commute times for drivers as all available research shows that induced demand will result in the same amount of gridlock.

        "comment": "I welcome the removal of bike lanes placed along Bloor St. W. through Bloor-West Village. Not only have bike lanes reduced lanes along Bloor, but had created an unsafe environment for the local community.\nFirst, as a car user who travels to see their parents in Halton Region with my children, it is frustrating to have to sit idle in traffic while trying to leave my area. Even while carpooling to work, picking up my colleague in the Kingsway area has taken me up to 15 minutes longer than in the past, wasting fuel and expelling emissions while seeing empty/idle bike lanes.\nSecond, the placement of bike lanes has resulted in a massive increase in vehicles traveling through the residential area to the north, where I live. These vehicles are doing everything possible to avoid the gridlock at Bloor/Runnymede and Bloor/Jane. They speed through the area, rolling stop signs or not even yielding to them, while traveling above the speed limit. With thousands of children in the area the number of near-misses seen on a daily basis is totally uncalled for and as a direct result of drivers' frustration to the bike lanes placed on Bloor and their avoiding of such. Sure, speed limits were reduced from 40 kph to 30 kph, but that results in nothing without enforcement. It means nothing when the same vehicles traveling 30 kph blast through stop signs at 30 kph. I have yet to see an increased police presence in the area. Nor do I see the city monitoring traffic counts on our street; they are counting cars on Bloor and touting positive results while turning a blind-eye to impacts on adjacent streets. If those cars now traveling through the neighborhood, that were not present before the bike lane placements, were replaced by bicycles, the impacts would not exist. Everybody is in a rush, which soon will result in more conflicts between area residents and will likely lead to an increase in pedestrian/cyclist related incidents in the near future.\nThird, I can see the massive impact bike lanes have had on 2422 Bloor St W, Health Services building. I see seniors trying to access the area with walkers and wheelchairs unable to get into their parking lot. With little to no parking, I am seeing them resort to exiting their vehicles in live traffic, trying to make their way to the sidewalk, so to acquire the services that they require. This is not only short sighted and unaccommodating to those with special needs, it's down-right dangerous.\nFinally, the city has taken no time to accommodate freight. There are numerous business along this stretch of Bloor-West where deliveries are made on a daily basis. Trucks and tractor-trailers used to have the ability to park and load/unload along Bloor St. W. They cannot be accommodated in the alley's behind, nor can they now park along Bloor with bike lanes and street furniture present. The result in those same trucks now traveling through the 'No Truck Zone' north of Bloor, through the residential area, so that they can access the businesses that they serve. But, where do they park? They have no option but to park in No Stopping and No Standing Zones. I've seen them ticketed, which will obviously increase the price of the freight. But even more worrisome is parking enforcement officers telling the trucks they can't park there, raising their voices when the driver indicates they have nowhere else to park.\nAll of this is to say that the city has decreased safety and increased traffic on side streets, through residential areas, in an attempt to please cyclists with a loud voice. It's a blind decision that is not based on science, and they are only seeking information on traffic impacts along their stretch of bike lanes without considering impacts in and around the main thoroughfare where these lanes are placed.\n"

        "comment": "It is a travesty that the province is wasting time and tax dollars trying to set Ontario infrastructure back by removing people's freedom of choice in safe and healthy transportation. The province should be embracing bike lanes as it reduces our over reliance on car infrastructure and reduces gridlock as more options become available and people are able to transition to using bikes for more of their daily commutes. We need more protected bike lanes not less that allow people to link up with public transit.\nI unfortunately live in a smaller city with no dedicated bike lanes and forced to either drive or risk my life by sharing the road with faster moving cars while on a bike. Us and our children should be allowed to live in an environment that encourages us to be physically active commuting with the reduced levels of pollution that comes with less cars on the road.\nI urge the government to set higher standards so that we can try and work towards empowering the people of Ontario to have freedom of choice to bike and use public transit and one day catch up with some of our European brother's and sister's who are already able to enjoy those freedom's.\n"

        "comment": "As a newly graduated student now working full time, biking has proved to be a very economical and important method of transportation for me and my fellow peers in our time at school and beyond. I live in Ottawa, and have seen an increase in biking when new bike lanes are added. Furthermore, these proper lanes promote safety of the cyclists by keeping a safe median or distance with motor vehicles.\nThe Bill proposes the province must approve bike lanes requiring removal of a traffic lane; yet I find several streets here that would benefit from a bike lane that moves several people along a street, rather than a wasted space for handful of parked cars. I don't believe the province should dictate what the city deems best for moving its people.\nHaving recently gotten a car commute to my work, I also strongly feel from this perspective that I would much rather have cyclists in their own dedicated and safe lanes, rather than being so close to a rolling several ton killing machine. Some of the streets I drive along have too many lanes, and had they supported safe bike lanes, I would definitely consider biking instead.\nThis act will not save anyone time, it will not reduce gridlock. I am 23 and understand the idea of induced demand better than the politicians still thinking under the primitive idea that \"one more lane\" will fix traffic congestion. I recently traveled to the Netherlands, and it was clearly evident that bikes and bike infrastructure moved a lot more people than cars ever could. Cycling is a convenient, budget-friendly, and environmentally conscious option for transportation which should be prioritized much higher than it currently is in our cities. Not to mention the physical exercise benefits that would lead to a healthier population.\nFinally, I remain confused why the province thinks it has jurisdiction to municipal affairs such as city designs and transportation decisions. Yet I hope that this bill does not come to fruition, or else I fear we will be set back in time to further car dependency and gridlock.\n"

We need to support greener modes of transit like biking, not take out bike lanes to prioritize cars which are are a leading emitter of greenhouse gases.  To ask the City of Toronto to spend its own money to take out bike lanes that were just recently installed (like the ones on University Avenue) is a complete waste of taxpayers money.  Bike lanes create a safe way for people to commute and travel around the city on a bike, which is so important to encourage people to get out of their cars and take active transportation instead.  It is not the Provinces job to police how the cities plan and utilize their streets to best support their community and the needs to provide many modes of transportation options.  Reducing a car commuters time  by a few minutes is not more important than protecting our environment and reducing our greenhouse gas emissions.  We are in the climate crises and the province is seeing the effects, flooding, wildfires, extreme heat are all way more important things to tackle than saving a few minutes on a daily car commute.\nRemoving environmental assessments to approve a highway and bike lanes is also going against the best interest of the citizens of this province, we need to ensure these projects are not going to harm our environment further.\nIt is a disgrace in this time of a climate crises that this provincial government wants to take away bike lines and do away with environmental assessments.  This government does not care about the people, it cares about lining the pocketbooks of its supports, as was clear during the Greenbelt scandal.\n"

Cycling is a growing mode of transportation, recreation and profession in Toronto.  Many food app delivery services use bicycles and e-bikes.  The removal of the Jarvis Bike lane shows that removing bike lines is not just ineffective, it actually worsens congestion and travel time.  When the premier and minister of transportation talk about low usage, they look like fools.  Of course the usage is low relative to motor vehicles, they have huge networks of roads.  Bikes have much fewer options (some of which are still being completed) and many people still feel unsafe when using unprotected lanes.

One of my patients sustained a cervical spine fracture while cycling on Yonge Street, prior to the installation of a bike lane. A truck took him out during a right turn. He has had 6 years of chronic pain and PTSD since the incident. His life will never be the same. It is unsconscionable that the provincial government is reaching beyond its jurisdiction to remove a safety barrier for vulnerable road users that prevents death and significant injuries. More vulnerable road users such as pedestrians and cyclists will die as a result of this terrible decision.\nPeople who use bicycles, like people in cars and pedestrians, like to take the most direct route from point A to point B. For that reason, installing bike lanes on alternative non-arterial roads will not work. People will continue to bicycle on Bloor, for example, but will lack adequate protection.\nResearch from many jurisdictions, including Toronto (Cyclist-motor vehicle collisions before and after implementation of cycle tracks in Toronto, Canada - PubMed), shows that protected bicycle lanes reduce the risk of motor vehicle trauma for pedestrians and cyclists. A recent position statement from the Canadian Paediatric Society strongly endorses protected bike lanes as a way to protect children, the most vulnerable road users (Improving cycling safety for children and youth | Canadian Paediatric Society). Public health data can identify high-risk areas (Association between neighbourhood marginalization and pedestrian and cyclist collisions in Toronto intersections - PubMed). Reductions in speed that result from changes to road design also improve safety for motorists. Bicycle lanes benefit all road users, and it is much preferable to prevent motor vehicle trauma than to try to treat it.\n"
