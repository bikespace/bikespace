        "comment": "I strongly oppose this bill as this is an ill thought plan which will only worsen the problems it claims to address.\nIt is claimed that Bill will reduce Gridlock by removing bike lanes. It sounds like the legislators behind this draft bill have never heard of the concept of \"induced demand\". It is scientifically proven that adding more lanes only encourages more people to drive, which quickly leads to more cars on the road and then more traffic congestion, despite the lane widening. A never ending vicious circle. Here is a article for reference - https://thenarwhal.ca/ontario-highways-induced-demand-explainer/\nI don't understand why the bill only considers the rights of vehicle owners. What about the rights of pedestrians? Cyclists? Users of public transport? Making car a necessary need for commuting only increases economic burden on households who are forced to spend an unreasonable amount of their income on commuting expenses. A better public transport can not only save people's time but also money.\nThe bill talks about rider safety, but no one has ever died because they got hit by a bike. It's only car accidents that cause deaths. It's simple -  encouraging more people to use bikes would reduce deaths on the roads, while having more cars on the road will increase accidents.\nThe city should be investing in public transport of which bike lanes are an important part. If at all the government insists on removing bike lanes, they should be replaced by dedicated bus lanes and not given away to private vehicles. Widening lanes of private cars will be a gross wastage of taxpayer money. It will not solve the core issue and only push the problems a few months into the future. Not to mention the environmental damage this will cause.\nIt shocking that in an era when most major cities are focusing on creating user centric, walkable cities, we are regressing backwards.\nPlease hire some educated Urban planners to come up with modern urban planning solutions rather than whoever is coming up with these archaic ideas.\n"

        "comment": "I do not agree with this bill. The provincial government should not be deciding what is best for the City of Toronto. Spending money to remove existing infrastructure makes no sense. Bikers are just going to bike on the road if there are no bike lanes. As a driver, I do not want to be sharing a lane with a biker as it is very dangerous for them and makes my commute slower.\n"

        "comment": "This proposed bill is regressive and short-sighted. As a former conservative voter, I am deeply disappointed by this move. More lanes does not improve traffic conditions. The way to reduce traffic congestion is to make our transit network more versatile, give people more safe and reliable choices for their commutes, and so on. Like so many Ontarians, if I have a reliable method of transport other than a car, I will take it.\nTaking choices out of the hands of municipalities is anti-conservative. It promotes more top-down bureaucracy and it places too much control in the hands of politicians who are dissociated from the regional concerns.\n"

        "comment": "This piece of legislation will be as useful for solving gridlock as a wet newspaper will save you from the rain. There is no rationality, no data, no common sense involved in this decision. What about removing the ample parking lanes on these streets, or many other Ontario streets to reduce gridlock. But oh wait, none of that will work, because induced demand seems to be completely ignore in this scenario!\nAll this does is antagonize cyclists. Perhaps if cycling was safe, less people would need to drive, freeing up space for other drivers. But it just seems this government wants to ignore safety and reason so they can try and divided and fracture the people of Ontario.\nI use these bike lanes to go to work, and by removing them, the province is making my life for dangerous. Now I will have to weave between traffic to get to where I want to go, because for most of these lanes, there are no viable alternatives.\n"

        "comment": "Car dependence is ruining our cities. No one likes driving. Biking is a sustainable mode of transportation that also encourages taking transit. Bike lanes will take cars OFF the road and reduce congestion. Adding more car lanes will remove options and instead create induced demand.\nThere are already too many cars and suburbs. Doug Ford shot down policies to allow building fourplexes, worsening the housing crisis. He has no understanding of sustainable development and urbanism.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes is a terrible idea for this city. This important infrastructure that is becoming more and more used every year and consistently becoming more of a serious mode of transportation for Torontonians. The ridership levels have continued to grow due to this investment in the public infrastructure and removing them will only bring more cars to the road, creating more traffic and making our streets more dangerous. Cycling is not just for recreation, it is for commuting and this government needs to take it seriously if they actually want to combat congestion. Additionally, the provincial government stepping in to remove infrastructure from a city that is trying to adapt to become a better city is overreach in my opinion.\n"

        "comment": "As a resident of Toronto, I am very concerned about what this bill proposes. Toronto's cycling scene is just beginning to pick up steam, and this bill aims to shut down all current and future progress, and to set us back a couple years with the removal of the Bloor, Yonge, and University cycling corridors.\nData suggests that Bike Share Toronto has recorded over double the number of rides in 2024 compared to 2021, and this is despite the fact that there are large regions lacking cycling infrastructure in Toronto, which prevents the cycling network from being continuous and allowing cyclists to access all areas of the city.\nI strongly believe that this bill will completely halt the growth of developing cycling infrastructure in Ontario.The introduction of unnecessary bureaucracy into the development of cycling infrastructure will, as it has for residential developments in Toronto as well, severely delay the process of providing cycling infrastructure for an ever growing body of frequent cyclists in the city.\nA significant number of Toronto residents, myself included, are interested in cycling to get around the city. The main obstacle to pursuing this interest for myself, as I am sure is the case for many other GTA residents as well, is that current cycling infrastructure is not sufficient to allow for safe and convenient rides. I believe that if this bill is not passed, cycling infrastructure will continue to grow in Toronto, and will match a growing demand for potential cyclists such as myself.\n"

The more people we can get out of their cars (and onto bikes or into the TTC), the safer, the quieter, the more pleasant, the healthier our city gets. Side streets are not an option for bike lanes because they are often interrupted and are much slower to take than arterials.\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nThis issue affects and pains me living and biking in Toronto for 15 years. I use bike lanes on a weekly basis and consider them essential infrastructure just as much as sidewalks. These are crucial to my enjoyment of the city and traversing around it and this bill has me distressed over losing something that I genuinely love about living here.\nBeyond personal enjoyment, this is fundamentally about road safety. If this bill passes and removes established bike lanes, cyclists will still use these roads, and heavy traffic will persist. The difference is that without this infrastructure, cyclists will be in tighter, more dangerous spaces, creating higher risks for everyone, especially for inexperienced cyclists and drivers now forced into closer quarters.\nFinally, this is a municipal issue that the provincial government does not need to get involved with. Why add more unnecessary red tape and bureaucracy for city governments simply trying to expand transportation options?  Bike lanes on main streets are not the problem\u2014the real issue is the volume of cars entering the city from afar. Improved public transit and more bike lanes, not fewer, will help alleviate this. Bike lanes on side streets are fine for short trips, but they don\u2019t serve the needs of cyclists traveling longer distances, such as North-South along Yonge or East-West along Bloor.\nThank you I could go on but please help save our bike lanes in Toronto and elsewhere. They are a lifeblood for any city and contribute to a healthier person.\nThank you,\nRobert A\n"

        "comment": "Cyclists deserve critical safety infrastructure. Where are they to go? Should we remove sidewalks too? All road users deserve SAFE infrastructure. Complaining that bike lanes are empty is absurd when the biking corridors are not yet complete end-to-end. What if you were to close down half of the streets in a city at random and complain that no one was using a car? To reduce gridlock, we must provide alternatives. Look globally to any large city, they rely heavily on transit, walking, and cycling. Cities can't handle the millions of cars we try to squeeze into them.\n"

Traveling around Toronto by bike is much faster than by car. On a daily basis, i see gridlock on the street with bumper to bumper cars. Meanwhile me and the hundreds of bikers glide past. You get rid of bike lanes it will just cause 2 lanes of bumper to bumper traffic. Or bikers might start taking the full lane. It is the law after all. Imagine the backlash from the car drivers if more and more bikers start taking up a full car lane.\n"

        "comment": "This legislation makes me livid. It is so counterintuitive to suggest removing and restricting bike lanes solves congestion. Solving congestion means providing viable alternatives to driving that are comparable in speed and safety. You cant provide these viable alternatives if you remove them in favor of an extra lane of car traffic. Urban planners and engineers have known this for decades, and it makes no sense that, in 2024, we still don't listen to them in favour of playing political games. This legislation will hurt Ontario, and its effects will be felt for decades.\nOn a more personal note, the cost of living in Ontario is crushing. I'll be lucky to afford a small apartment in Toronto, let alone a car or a full size house in the suburbs. Biking is one more way I can save money instead of paying absurd prices to own and operate a car. Instead of attacking working class Ontarians like me, why doesn't the Conservative government table legislation with real solutions? Why are we still treating bike lanes as another pawn in a political game? Please, do not pass this legislation, and instead focus on actually solving the problems Ontario is faced with.\nCheers,\n"

Moreover the provincial government is overstepping with this proposal and taking on responsibility that should lie with municipal governments.\nWhat data is there to show that this could possibly help improve traffic while keeping cyclists safe?\n"
