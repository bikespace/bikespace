        "comment": "I believe the jurisdiction of bike lanes should remain with municipalities. Because they naturally have a closer working relationship with the local community, that experience leads them to having a stronger hands-on knowledge and understanding of the needs of the local population. As well, they\u2019ll know the local intricacies around what is more likely to be an effective solution in the area for tackling gridlock.\nThat aside, there doesn\u2019t seem to be much evidence indicating that refusing to implement bike lanes would address gridlock. That would actually be a non-action with no changes, meaning there would be no improvements to the local road infrastructure at all. At the end of the day, the bikes and cars would still both be on the road having to negotiate sharing the same space.\nAs a driver, I find that having to constantly change lanes while accommodating the slower speeds of bikes both increases gridlock and makes the roads more dangerous for everyone. It\u2019s a more complicated, accident prone and slower driving experience. The roads are chaotic.\nWhen there are bike lanes, cars and bikes have their own space. It makes for a faster, safer and calmer commute because you don\u2019t have to negotiate sharing space with cyclists.\n"

The creation of bike lanes in cities has been an incredible improvement in quality of life and the safety of our children.\nIt is a waste of the province's time, and the worst kind of red tape creation, to micromanage local road decisions.  The purpose of municipalities is to respond best to local needs.\n"

        "comment": "I am 27, work in Finance (capital markets), am a homeowner, & am in the top tax bracket (you can verify by checking my tax returns). I will honestly say that I was planning on voting for Doug Ford this next election, chiefly because of his plans to remove safe consumption sites, but the plan to remove bike lanes has removed any possibility of him receiving my vote in the future.\nI fundamentally think this is a terrible idea. Ripping out bike lanes, simply put, will lead to more people dying on our streets. I bike to work most days & I work downtown in the financial district. On my commute, I have access to bike lanes via Gerrard (which cars regularly block) & Bay Street until Dundas (which cars regularly block). After Dundas, the right lane of Bay St turns into a lane for bikes, motorcycle, buses, & taxis, although it is regularly filled with commuters who shouldn't be using this lane. On this short strip of road, on Bay from Dundas to King, I am on a daily basis, passed incredibly dangerously (less than 1 meter of space) by impatient drivers that don't realize how dangerous their actions are. The irony is they are passing me to occupy a lane they shouldn't be in and should be ticketed for using (this could literally make millions in rev for the govt, if you started enforcing this stretch of Bay).\nAll of this to say, if this is my experience on a 4 block stretch, imagine how bad it would be on a long commute along Bloor with no bike lanes. Or down Yonge Street or university.\nThe second irony, of course, is that removing these bike lanes would mean cyclists would have to occupy a car lane (either by driving or biking, both of which would lead to more congestion). Bloor, Yonge, & University, as you have identified, are major roads, meaning they have people living adjacent to them & businesses along them. Removing these lanes won't mean people will stop bike commuting on these roads. It will likely mean, though, that more people get hit by cars because they no longer have protection and more people will drive leading to more congestion all around.\nThink about your children & your family. What if they had been one of the many cyclists or pedestrians killed this year due to dangerous drivers. What if they become one of the surely many that are killed after you do remove these lanes.\nDo you really want to regress our city? Or do you want to propel it into the future?\n"

Travelling by bicycle takes one more car off the road. If you take away bike lanes, you are putting more cars back on the road, thus contributing to more congestion.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal ignores years of research pointing to the fact that the more roads we have the more vehicular traffic we have. The answer is better public transportation and active transportation.  Removing bike lanes increases GHG emissions and contributes to poorer health and higher health costs. Ontario is moving backwards when we greatly need embrace actions to reduce private vehicular use.\n"

        "comment": "I'm writing to express my deep opposition to the \"Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act\", a proposal that poses a real and present danger to public safety by requiring municipalities to seek provincial approval to develop bike lanes if doing so would reduce car lanes. This bill is, frankly, a reckless overreach that threatens lives, undermines municipal authority, and prioritizes cars at the expense of safer, healthier communities.\nBike infrastructure isn\u2019t just a convenience\u2014it\u2019s a necessity. In the past two months, Ottawa has seen two tragic cyclist fatalities, both preventable if there had been adequate bike lanes. Less than a month ago, a member of my own family was hit by a car while cycling in the rural town of Russell. They sustained life-threatening injuries: a brain bleed, multiple fractures in their spine, a broken pelvis, and a shattered knee. If a bike lane had been in place, this accident could have been entirely avoided. The lack of safe infrastructure forced them onto the road, placing them at risk.\nJust two weeks ago, I personally witnessed another cyclist hit on one of Ottawa\u2019s main arteries, an accident that was horrifyingly predictable given the absence of a bike lane. I watched in shock as the cyclist was flung into the air, his bike smashed into a car windshield, and his body hit the pavement hard as he attempted to brace his fall. He was fortunate to have sustained no serious injuries. These incidents are not isolated\u2014this is the grim reality of insufficient bike infrastructure in our city.\nThis Act\u2019s focus on preserving car lanes rather than investing in safe, sustainable transportation options is shortsighted and irresponsible. People will continue to bike, whether or not the province chooses to make it safe for them. Prioritizing car lanes over the well-being of cyclists is an active decision to place Ontarians at risk, and it is unconscionable. The fact that this legislation even prioritizes reducing gridlock for motor vehicles shows a disturbing disregard for the human and environmental costs of traffic-heavy urban areas. Car traffic is a primary contributor to the pollution of our air, the warming of our planet, and the congestion that makes our cities inaccessible. If drivers experience gridlock, that is simply a reflection of the realities they themselves contribute to. Meanwhile, those of us who choose active transportation are left in danger because we lack basic safety infrastructure.\nBeyond safety, failing to build bike lanes ignores the broader benefits of active transportation. Numerous studies show that bike-friendly cities enjoy cleaner air, healthier populations, and happier residents. Research has shown that communities with more bike infrastructure are safer, healthier, and more enjoyable places to live, and that the absence of safe cycling routes is a major contributor to injuries and fatalities. Prioritizing cars and neglecting these benefits shows an utter disregard for public health, the environment, and quality of life in Ontario.\nFinally, the Premier\u2019s recent comments about the unhoused, urging them to \u201cget off [their] ass and start working like everyone else,\u201d further reveal his profound disconnect from the daily realities of so many Ontarians. This policy, much like his approach to safe injection sites, represents a government that is not only out of touch but actively chooses to ignore both public health data and the safety of its citizens.\nSimply, the \"Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act\" represents a significant and dangerous shift in Ontario\u2019s transportation policy, one that threatens the safety, well-being, and autonomy of our communities. I urge the government to withdraw this bill and allow municipalities the freedom to protect and improve their communities as they see fit. We need legislation that prioritizes people, not cars.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is fundamentally flawed and repeatedly the words used in it are biased towards drivers.\nWhere is the inclusion of others affected by the proposal? People that live on this street will be affected. Do you think they want more cars in their neighbourhood?\nHow do Provincial planners or traffic engineers think they will understand the impacts to all users of the roadway? Looking at a plan on a screen is not the same thing as living in that City, even if they visit the site.\nThe proposal only speaks to time and goods. Where is the safety? The safety of all road users is important. It is disgusting when peoples time and convenience are ahead of people being injured or killed.\nThe prioritization of highways over other modes of transport is misplaced. There are better ways of creating efficiencies without differing to more cars and trucks. Where is the investment in rail for goods? Inside cities, cargo bikes and variants are faster, more efficient, less congesting, and produce no pollutants while being used.\nThe continued commitment, and in the case reversion, to cars is sad. Cars are noisy, polluting, and dangerous to everyone outside them. Catering to cars is not the solution of a progressive city or Province. Time to move forward.\nI drive and ride a bike. Both of them for commuting, travel, and sport. I have raced cars and raced bicycles, and even use my car to transport my bicycle. Still cars are not the answer to the future of travel, efficiency and goods. The mindset that cars are always the priority and always the answer needs to stop.\n"

As a driver and cyclist, I want to see MORE bike lanes, more complete streets, more car-free streets. Cyclists will just take up a car lane, this proposal does nothing helpful and is in fact dangerous. There will be more accidents, death and injuries. I also don't like the sly inclusion for getting rid of environmental studies. That smells like Ford wanting to push through highways without care for the environment. This proposal should be scrapped, along with Ford and the Ontario CONartists.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is a cynical and politically self-serving monstrosity which will slow down or stop the installation of bike lanes across Ontario.\nWe know that the only solution to traffic is to offer alternative means of transportation. The result of people moving to literally anything other than a private automobile is a reduction in pollution. Period. Removing (as has been proposed for several current bike lanes) or delaying (through bureaucracy) an active transportation option will continue to Ontario continuing to miss any sort of reasonable emissions targets. From a safety perspective, the Premier himself has talked about how dangerous it is riding a bike when sharing the road with cars. Protected bike lanes are essential for making cycling safer.\nBottom line, this proposal is about \"sticking it to Toronto\" and anyone who cares about the environment. The proposal should be immediately withdrawn in favour of making it easier for more bike lanes to be built in Ontario with fewer roadblocks such as this would create.\n"
