        "comment": "This is a gross over reach of a CONSERVATIVE government. The municipalities can decide for themselves! A government should not revert a municipal decision regarding their own streets, especially a conservative one. This bill is shameful and paints a bad light on the conservatives, especially considering the upcoming election.\nThis bill would simply waste millions of taxpayer money by reverting streets to their previous arrangements rather than reducing taxes or spending the funds more wisely.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose this bill for several reasons.\n1. There is no evidence that reducing traffic lanes will increase traffic, and in fact all available evidence suggests reducing traffic lanes actually reduces traffic (see link), so this bill does not solve the problem it claims to solve\n2. This bill will spend significant taxpayer money in failing to solve the problems it claims to solve, and that money could be far better allocated elsewhere.\n3. The bill says that \"implications to the environment will be considered\", but also includes an exemption from the Environmental Assessment Act, which strongly suggests that implications to the environment will not be considered or that if they are, those implications will be ignored if they turn out to negatively impact the environment.\n3b. With every reputable scientist saying that climate change is the greatest threat of our age, reducing access to climate-friendly means of transporting and increasing access to climate-hostile forms of transportation is a grave mistake.\n4. Increasing access to car-safe cycling, a form of exercise that has potential to improve the cardiovascular health of Canadians, could potentially decrease healthcare spending by creating healthier citizens. Shutting off access to safe and healthy forms of exercise is bad for Canadian citizens and bad for the budget.\n5. I do not believe the province should be involved in micromanaging the bike lanes of municipalities.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes would be a huge mistake in my opinion. I'm not sure why we are not disincentivizing private cars using the downtown Toronto area. In my opinion, cars and transit sharing a lane contributes to the traffic problem far more than having bike lanes does. At a time when the effects of climate change are obvious and disastrous, we need more people to use bikes and transit. Please, please, please leave the bike lanes so cyclists' lives aren't at risk for choosing sustainable transport.\n"

        "comment": "Please do not tear up the bike lanes. I am primarily a driver in Toronto (living in Etobicoke/York) and have a child entering the solo public transit& biking years (i.e., tween-teenage years).\nThe bike lanes force all of us to be more careful, with pedestrians, cyclists and other drivers alike. They also encourage us all to think about our routes more carefully and consider walking or taking transit when it makes more sense. I am even considering getting back on a bike now that there are more dedicated lanes! I was too scared to do this in the past due to lack of dedicated bike lanes and low awareness from drivers about sharing the road. This feels like an unnecessary expense (to rip up existing lanes) and a step backwards in planning a livable city (to restrict future bike lanes).\nAs we encourage housing density to address housing shortages, we should also be thinking about alternate forms of transport and accessibility for people at lower incomes.\n"

        "comment": "This comment, that I endorse, has been originally written and signed by 120 physicians and researchers from the University of Toronto.\nLegislation that guides road design must prioritize safety over travel times\nIn Canada during 2022, 294 pedestrians, 46 cyclists, 258 motorcyclists, 316 passengers, and 952 drivers died in collisions. There were 8,851 serious injuries from collisions, including pedestrians (15 per cent), cyclists (5 per cent), motorcyclists (13 per cent), passengers (17 per cent) and drivers (47 per cent). As of Oct. 9 this year in Toronto, 16 pedestrians, six cyclists, three motorcyclists and 10 motorists have been killed by traffic-related trauma. Every fatality is the loss of a person, someone who loved and was loved.\nThe vast majority of traffic-related fatalities \u2013 pedestrian and cyclist especially \u2013 are preventable. Research from many jurisdictions, including Toronto, shows that protected bicycle lanes reduce the risk of motor vehicle trauma for pedestrians and cyclists. A recent position statement from the Canadian Paediatric Society strongly endorses protected bike lanes as a way to protect children, the most vulnerable road users. Public health data can identify high-risk areas. Reductions in speed that result from changes to road design also improve safety for motorists. Bicycle lanes benefit all road users, and it is much preferable to prevent motor vehicle trauma than to try to treat it. Not only can these devastating injuries destroy lives, the costs for this care, and the opportunity-costs of lost productivity, are borne by society.\nFor this reason, I strongly oppose the recent proposed Ontario legislation, Bill 212, that limits the ability for municipalities and cities to make their roads safer for their citizens. The legislation requires that municipalities seek Ministry of Transportation approval before installing cycling lanes that reduce the number of lanes available for motor vehicles. The legislation states that the ministry will base its decision on whether to approve a bicycle lane on \u201cwhether it would unduly diminish the orderly movement of motor vehicle traffic\u201d, without any mention of safety for road users.\nThe Ministry of Transportation is responsible for serving the people of Ontario, not its motor vehicles. We must address the root causes of traffic congestion and provide options for solutions, such as improved transit connectivity and reliability, incentives for choosing alternatives to motor vehicle travel, and support for complete streets that offer safe and efficient transportation options for all people.\nLegislation proposing to guide road design decisions, such as Bill 212, should explicitly place a higher priority on road safety than motor vehicle travel times.\nSource and further information:\nhttps://healthydebate.ca/2024/10/topic/legislation-road-design-safety-t\u2026\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes on critical stretches of roads spanning across Toronto when they were just recently added makes absolutely no sense. It's a misuse of public funds, and removing bike lanes is not in the best interest of public safety and public health. A study in 2020 concluded that after the implementation of bike lanes, there was a 38% reduction in the rate of cyclist-motor vehicle collisions rate per cyclist month (Ling et al., 2020).\nI won't even go into the details of the benefits of encouraging cycling and having infrastructure that supports cycling on public health - reduction of air pollution, noise pollution, promote fitness and wellbeing. I'm sure you know that, hopefully.\n"

        "comment": "Let's be very clear. The government of Ontario is once again arbitrarily deciding what it thinks is \"best\" for the citizens of Toronto.\nAs the world struggles to cope with climate change, and major cities enact congestion zones and tolls to curb grid lock and reduce pollution (see London, Singapore, San Diego, Milan, Stockholm*) along comes Premier Ford to set Toronto back two decades.\nBill is 212 is titled: \"Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act\"?\nWhose time are we talking about?\nNot mine. I've lived, worked, biked and driven in Toronto for over 40 years, and I can safely  say the new bike lanes have not just changed my life, they've saved my life. This is especially true on University Avenue and Bloor St, where right-turning vehicles frequently cut corners, oblivious to the presence of bicyclists.\nAs a car driver, I have come to terms with the minor inconvenience of reduced on street parking on Bloor. I ride my bike or take the TTC... sometimes I even walk.\nSo, please, spare us the patronizing. This is an aggressive act on behalf of an aggrieved class of entitled car drivers.\nAs Toronto Mayor Chow says, \"By ripping up our roads, the province will only make congestion worse and our streets less safe for cyclists and drivers alike. The City's preference is to work collaboratively with the province to address issues, rather than be subject to arbitrary and costly infrastructure changes which are NOT BASED ON ANY EVIDENCE.\" [Emphasis mine]\nBy the way, Premier Ford, the City of Toronto also reduced the speed limit on city streets. Maybe you should jack those up and get your pals moving even faster.\n*https://www.smartcitiesdive.com/ex/sustainablecitiescollective/five-cit\u2026\n"

        "comment": "Thank you. Its about time!! Can happen fast enough!!!!!!\nAs someone who has to drive in to work downtown on a daily basis and has seen the traffic come to a stand still as bike lanes cause majority of the issues. Yes, construction is an issue but there always has been construction.\nThe bike lanes on the main arteries already mentioned and on others like Adelaide which took a 4 lane exit from downtown to a single lane and by the time you get out of downtown its time to go back in.\nIts so frustrating sitting in traffic and watching empty bike lanes and going reality does not match city's messaging.\nSo we are told that according to studies, bike lanes only add 3 min to the traffic. I guess whoever did the study did not drive in what was a 2 lane road and now is a single lane and everytime someone makes a left OR right turn, you basically loose a light (so a 3 minute delay-i get it) but thats almost for every intersection so 3 minutes times every intersection. Nice study.\n"

        "comment": "It makes no sense to remove existing bike lanes for many reasons.  They safe and save lives, encourages and enables more people to get out of their cars and reduce pollution/carbon emission while creating a healthy lifestyle.  Not to mention the huge amount of our tax payers money to remove - not to mention the traffic blocking to do the work and massive waste it will produce.  It's an extremely backwards approach.  The cost will be ridiculous, when that good money should be supporting more important issues like healthcare, housing and the list goes on.  Removing the bike lanes is not the solution to traffic gridlock. Please, please do not let it happen.  I would not be entirely opposed to pausing any proposed new bike lanes (reluctantly), with allowing current ones under construction to be finished.  The province most likely has no jurisdiction over municipal affairs as such.\nThank you.\n"

At worst, the bike lanes cited on major thoroughfares of Yonge / Bloor / University may very well cause a couple of minutes delays to drivers but that seems a fair trade-off to (1) protect the safety of vulnerable road users (2) having alternative means to get around the city in the most direct way possible other than a car.  Thinking long-term as this city grows, government should try to encourage LESS cars on the road to try to tackle congestion.\nAlso, I HATE that this government is willing to waste taxpayer money pulling out existing bike lanes.\n"
