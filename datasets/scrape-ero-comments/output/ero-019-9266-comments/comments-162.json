        "comment": "First, it is an absurd overreach of provincial power. Why is the province wasting its time and resources micro managing municipalities?\nSecond, ripping out existing bike lines is just a stupid waste of money.\nYou want to reduce gridlock? Reduce the number of people in cars. Thats it. That is literally the only way. There is endless data demonstrating this. You will not solve gridlock with new lanes, or by pissing away billions of dollars on a tunnel. You need to\na) Divert people away from high density areas. People should not be growing THROUGH Toronto unless their destination is in Toronto\nb) Providing effective alternative transport methods such as robust public transit and avenues for active transport (LIKE BIKE LANES), so people can do things other then drive.\nc) Change zoning laws to allow for more mixed use neighbourhoods so more people can live close to where they work so they dont have to commute, or at the very least, live close to shops and services so they can access the majority of what they need either without a car, or with a very short drive.\n"

There are years of studies that show a multitude of ways to reduce traffic that are being completely ignored with this proposal. Investment in public transit infrastructure is a great first step and I would suggest the premier move somewhere else if he doesn't like using public transit and insists on driving everywhere.\n"

        "comment": "This is a massive over-reach on the part of the province.  Decisions about bike lanes in different cities & towns around Ontario should be left up to the municipal governments of those cities and towns.  There are MANY more pressing issues facing the province of Ontario that are actually within the purview of the provincial government.\nThings like healthcare & education are falling apart and being criminally underfunded by our provincial government.  We the taxpayers are being told that there's no money to improve essential services, no money to pay for doctors & teachers.  Somehow there's provincial money to build a tunnel under the 401 and rip out bike lanes that were built at the expense of municipal taxpayers.\nI hope that whoever reads this comment feels embarrassed to be associated with this government.\n"

        "comment": "This is short-term gain legislation and ignores evidence-based long term urban planning solutions.\nMunicipalities globally are building more bicycle infrastructure  and public transit to reduce congestion and it's working. This trend will only expand, so ripping out existing bike lines that will only be reversed in the near future, is a tremendous waste of taxpayer money.\nAddressing gridlock has to acknowledge that cities are only sustainable through densification, which means reducing single occupant/vehicle travel, and not providing 'more' space for wasteful low density commutes and entertainment seeking, especially since science has shown that more lanes only bring more low-density traffic.\nThe fact that this legislation also seeks to skirt environmental protection regulation is another example of short-term planning, unless the provincial government actually doesn't believe in human lead climate change, and the attendant threat to bio-diversity. Why is the government willing to further endanger a collective future dependent on a clean, safe environment to benefit commuters.\nHow much evidence-based science is the provincial government willing to ignore to the disadvantage of the majority of taxpayers. Legislation that effects everyone can't be solely focused on commuter and commercial priorities.\nBill 212 will not reduce gridlock in the long term, but it will demonstrate to future governments that regulation is meant to be side-stepped for short term advantages, at the expense of long term stability.\n"

The result of this bill will be a mix of more people in cars and more bikes riding in the middle of the lanes. Is that beneficial to anyone? That's not even taking into account that this completely overrides city autonomy. Why should the provincial government have a say in if my side street has a bike lane or not? Should our local councillors not be in charge of that? That's literally the kind of thing we voted them in to decide for us.\n"

        "comment": "More people in the city, bike as the primary mode of transportation than drive a motor vehicle.\nIt is destructive to the flow of traffic to tear out the current bike lane infrastructure.  The only proven effective way to reduce congestion is to disincentivize driving cars.\nThere already is a faster way to travel along these streets, and it's the subway.  Encouraging decisions to further the agenda of commuters in motor vehicles, actually slows down everyone else in the city.\nIt appears that the current provicial government is only making selfish choices that they perceive would reduce their commute to Quebec's park.  When this legislature would only create more dangerous environments for the constituents living within the city's boundaries.\n"

        "comment": "Hello, I am writing to strongly oppose the proposal. Bike lanes should be a municipal decision, built according to the needs and desires of the municipality in which bike lanes serve as important transportation infrastructure.\nThe basis of this proposal - that the removal of bike lanes will alleviate traffic - has no scientific, practical, or financial basis.\nBike lanes are life-saving infrastructure that allow for a city's inhabitants to more easily opt out of driving. Studies of bike lanes in Toronto show that bike lanes increased cyclist volume by over 2.5x, which translates to a real reduction in the number of cars on the road. The use of Bike Share in Toronto has increased many times over - amounting to almost 6 million rides taken in 2023 alone.\nMoreover, many of Toronto's worst problem spots, such as Lakeshore and Jarvis, are in no way related to the presence of bike lanes.\nBike lanes create induced demand, which means that over time, more people will choose to bike over take their car. They are future-oriented infrastructure - not only for the fundamental fact that they prevent fatalities, but for the economic and environmental wellbeing of cities. Bike lanes are scientifically proven to reduce cyclist fatalities and reduce emissions. There is no supporting scientific evidence that the addition of car lanes reduces traffic; in fact, the opposite is more often the case.\nShould the provincial government remove bike lanes, many cyclists will be forced to use car lanes to navigate the city, which will increase confusion and create gridlock and frustration among car users. Removing bike lanes will not remove cyclists. They will simply remove SAFE cycling, forcing bikes onto the road with motor vehicles.\nThe provincial government should not spend taxpayer money on undoing municipal infrastructure projects and should instead focus on fixing the Gardiner, finishing the Eglinton LRT, and developing non-car-related methods for alleviating traffic in the city.\n"

        "comment": "This proposed law is a horrible idea.\n-Most cyclists are also drivers. If they can't ride their bike (and removing the Bloor, University, and Yonge bike lanes means there are no other SAFE options, many will drive and there will be that many more cars on the road, creating gridlock\n-Those who decide to keep riding will take the lane, slowing down drivers.\n-Induced demand: more lanes will only mean more cars, it is proven adding car lanes does not reduce gridlock.\n-The municipal government is much better placed to have a detailed knowledge of local roads than the provincial government\n-There have been 6 cyclists killed by drivers already this year, and this proposed law will endanger cyclists even more, it is irresponsible and murderous.\n-This law goes against climate goals, we are in a climate crisis and the provincial government is only going backwards\n-Thousand more condo units are to be built along transit corridors. Many of the people moving in these buildings will not own cars. They will rely on cycling and public transit to move around and commute. If they were all to drive, traffic would come to a standstill.\n"

It also exemplifies his terrible financial management in that making the changes will cost huge amounts of money, and will do nothing to help traffic while making things substantially worse for cyclists.\nMore bicycle lanes are the answer, not less. And better transit.\nThe environmental reviews for highway development should also not be bypassed.\n"
