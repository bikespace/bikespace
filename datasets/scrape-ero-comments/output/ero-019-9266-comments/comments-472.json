        "comment": "I am opposed to this framework for the following reasons.\n1. Bike lanes are a municipal area of responsibility, and the province should not be engaged in this domain. Municipalities such as the City of Toronto undertake extensive community consultation, data analysis, and due consideration when deciding where and how to implement bike lanes. Post-implementation they continue to make assessments and optimization. The province does not add value by interfering in this process.\n2. Comments from the Premier and the Minister for Transportation show that this is an ideologically-driven initiative rather than one based on data and analysis. For example, it has been shown by repeated studies, both within Ontario municipalities and abroad, that any increase to the travel times of other road users (such as cars and trucks) caused by the addition of bike lanes is negligible to non-existent. The ostensible reason for this framework - to address congestion and improve travel times on Ontario roads - is simply not supported by evidence.\n3. The few comments from the Premier and Minister that refer to data are referring to findings that are out of date or where important analysis is missing. For example, a figure cited is that only 1.2% of \u201cToronto\u201d commuters travel by bicycle to work. This figure is 13 years old and is from census data covering a massive swath of southern Ontario, from Ajax to Burlington and as far north as Lake Simcoe: areas that have no cycling infrastructure and are irrelevant to the issue of urban bike lanes. In fact, there has been a surge in urban cycle traffic as other, more recent studies show. Most relevant is a 2019 City of Toronto study that identified 70% of Torontonians ride bicycles, of whom 44% are \"utilitarian\" cyclists who bike to work, shop, travel for social engagements, etc.. It would be expected that similar findings exist in other urban centres. Including irrelevant arguments and statistics indicate this government is cherrypicking data points in an attempt to shore up a purely political stance.\n4. This framework distracts from the real actions the provincial government should be taking to address congestion. Ontario should be taking bold actions to vastly expand mass public transit and encourage multiple forms of transportation, especially those that are active and pose the greatest environmental benefits. Ironically, this would entail working with municipalities to enthusiastically increase the number and quality of bike lanes, rather than making them more difficult to implement or removing those already established.\n5. The framework also does not specify the costs to be borne my municipal governments in complying with the proposed bike lanes framework. This should be specified by the legislation for transparency and the full awareness of Ontarians, as it appears that the provincial government will impose the financial burden of compliance on municipalities.\nBill 212 is legislation that deliberately seeks to make it more difficult for municipalities to improve cycling infrastructure and make all forms of traffic work well together, and is a poor attempt to address its stated objective of reducing gridlock. I am opposed to it being passed into law.\n"

For this reason alone, it will lead to poor decision making and hurt Ontarians.\nBill 212 will lead to more congestion, not more. Promoting bike use is a good use of resources and this Bill 212 is a waste of tax payer's money. Bill 212 will negatively affect health and safety and cost the province significant money in health care and emergency services in the long term.\nBill 212 will negatively affect the livability of our cities with more congestion, more dangerous cycling options and poorer air quality. Ontario should be investing in reducing greenhouse gas emissions not going backwards as this Bill proposes to do.\nThis is an ill conceived legislative proposal with far too short a consultation process for sound consideration.\n"

        "comment": "I urge you NOT to move forward with Bill 212.\n1. One of the greatest failures of our Canadian democracy is the ability for changing governments, and different levels of government, to intervene in/cancel/reverse infrastructure projects. We spend more time back-and-forthing on supposedly done deals, than we do with moving forward. We've spent millions of dollars on this. We've spent years doing the reviews. We've conducted the research here in our own city once the lanes were installed. Why undo something, instead of doing something? Let's talk about the future, not fret about the past.\n2. Bike lanes are the future, and the city of Toronto is made safer and healthier for having them. Please review the literature provided by Cycle TO, by the City's infrastructure planning committee, as well as these articles I've attached.\n3. Here's some better ideas, if you seek to do something for traffic in TO:\n- ban right-turns-on-red: too dangerous, confusing, cars barely even stop. Illegal many places already, weird that it's permitted here.\n- more traffic cameras, catch people blocking the box, speeding, making illegal turns.\n- prohibit parking on any street with more than 2 lanes of traffic, at all times. I don't care where they park but it should not be permitted on a street with non-stop daily traffic jams.\n- small toll for entering downtown core in a car. common in many world-class cities. free to drive within most of the city, but within the centre, fee is required.\n- Force Metrolinx to open the Eglinton crosstown subway they've been building since 2016.\nIn conclusion: Your stated intent with this bill is right in the name, to reduce gridlock. I'm scared enough on these streets, whether I'm driving my car, riding my bike, or walking. Please review my suggestions for some other ideas, and don't waste your time trying to make a city into a suburb by ripping out/blocking bike lanes in order to prioritize car traffic.\nThis bill will actually just waste money and put people's lives at risk. Kindly reconsider.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to the Ontario government's recent proposal to remove sections of bike lanes on major Toronto streets and revert them to vehicle traffic lanes. This initiative is misguided for several reasons that deeply concern residents who value safety, sustainable commuting, and local governance.\n1. Safety Concerns for Cyclists\nThe City of Toronto has recently seen a troubling rise in cyclist deaths, highlighting the importance of dedicated bike lanes as a fundamental measure for protecting cyclists. Removing these lanes from key roads such as Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue would expose cyclists to increased danger, putting lives at risk. The presence of protected bike lanes provides necessary space between cyclists and vehicle traffic, reducing the frequency and severity of collisions.\n2. Increased Traffic Congestion\nContrary to the belief that removing bike lanes will ease traffic, it is the very presence of cyclists commuting to work that helps reduce gridlock. Every cyclist represents one less car contributing to traffic congestion. By dismantling bike lanes, the government risks pushing more individuals back into vehicles, worsening congestion and contradicting the proposal's stated goal of fighting gridlock.\n3. Provincial Overreach\nThis proposal also represents an alarming overreach of provincial authority, undermining the \"strong mayor\" system intended to empower municipalities to make decisions tailored to their unique needs. The City of Toronto should retain the autonomy to manage its infrastructure based on expert local assessments. The province's intervention sets a dangerous precedent, weakening local governance and stifling the city\u2019s ability to respond effectively to its transportation challenges.\n4. Environmental Implications\nThe potential environmental consequences of this proposal cannot be ignored. Bike lanes support climate action by encouraging sustainable transportation and reducing vehicle emissions. Reverting these lanes to car traffic not only threatens air quality but contradicts Toronto's climate goals. Moreover, the proposed exemption from the Environmental Assessment Act eliminates crucial oversight, allowing changes that could negatively impact urban sustainability.\nIn summary, this proposal endangers cyclists at a time when safety improvements are needed most, risks exacerbating traffic issues by discouraging cycling, undermines the principles of municipal self-governance, and carries significant environmental repercussions.\n"

Takes quite a bit to get someone from the family of a lifelong progressive conservative and advocate for fair government to start losing faith completely.

This bill is not only a massive step backward for our city but a direct threat to the safety and well-being of cyclists, pedestrians, and drivers alike.\nToronto has come a long way in creating infrastructure that supports cyclists and makes our streets safer for everyone. Removing these bike lanes is not only misguided but blatantly disregards the lives of those who rely on them. Every time a family member, friend, or coworker gets on their bike to commute to work, I worry. I wonder every time if this will be the last time I see them again, and the tragic reality is that too many cyclists have already lost their lives or faced serious injury on these streets. What is being proposed with Bill 212 makes it clear that safety is being sacrificed for the illusion of reducing driver traffic, a premise that isn\u2019t even supported by solid data.\nBesides the overwhelming evidence that bike lanes work, what about the climate implications. Choosing to cycle reduces car traffic and harmful emissions to our environment. Our government needs to get serious about this. It is one of the most eco-friendly ways to commute, and supporting bike infrastructure is essential in reducing harmful emissions in cities like Toronto. Every person who chooses to bike instead of drive helps cut down on greenhouse gases, air pollutants, and the traffic congestion that contributes to these emissions. Fewer cars on the road mean less carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and other harmful chemicals polluting our air, making the city a healthier place to live.\nThe idea that this will improve traffic flow is short-sighted. Bike lanes ease congestion by giving people a safe, reliable alternative to driving. Cities worldwide have shown that bike lanes improve traffic efficiency, reduce emissions, and build a more connected community. Taking them away will only lead to more congestion, pollution, and deaths on our roads. It\u2019s a decision that will undermine the progress Toronto has made as a city.\nAnd let\u2019s not overlook the financial waste here. Instead of investing in infrastructure that benefits everyone, the province is offering to spend taxpayer money on tearing down lanes that are actively helping people. This seems more about creating lucrative contracts for a select few than genuinely addressing traffic issues.\nUltimately, Bill 212 isn\u2019t just about bike lanes; it\u2019s about who we want to be as a city. Toronto deserves to be a place where everyone feels safe, whether they're cycling, driving, or walking. Everyone deserves the right to safe, accessible transit. By pushing this bill through, the government is telling us they don\u2019t care about our safety or the city\u2019s future.\nI urge the Legislature to reconsider this reckless decision and prioritize the safety and sustainability of our communities.\n"

I also suspect that removing lanes will not deter cyclists from using those streets: I take Dundas despite the lack of bike lanes because it\u2019s the fastest way for me to get to work (and I always get there faster than the idling cars that I pass along the way). Many cyclists like me will continue taking Bloor, Yonge and University, even if their bike lanes are removed.\nIt seems to me that this proposal is being supported by a vocal minority who have the intuitive but incorrect belief that removing bike lanes will reduce congestion.
