People will cycle regardless of whether there are bike lanes or not - the only outcome of removing bike lanes is wasting money and increasing accident rates. Traffic will be worsened given the increased number of accidents as well.\n\u201cYou\u2019re nervous when there\u2019s no bike lanes. At least I was. We have to do everything we can to make sure there\u2019s never a death in the city. One death is way too many when it comes to bicycle riders.\u201d\n- Doug Ford (2017)\n"

        "comment": "This bill is full of extremely short-sighted and  non-data supported decision-making.  It continues to show the focus of this government is enriching donors and developers for short term profits and not making life better for Ontarians.\nStarting with the bike lane proposal which is a transparent attempt to cover up the far more nefarious pieces of legislation contained within the bill.  On its face, limiting bike infrastructure is proven to be more dangerous for all road users and also contributes to worse air quality in the city.  I don\u2019t think I need to link the numerous studies, Global urban experiences (Paris in particular), and the innumerable professional, planning, and medical organizations that have spoken out against this legislation using data and lived experiences.  It is a shallow joke that the lanes the Premier is focusing on are those that impact his commute only.  I live in the city and am a driver and pedestrian (I aspire to cycle but it is too dangerous with no bike lanes in my neighbourhood).  I deeply appreciate the growth of separated and well-signed bike lanes that help me protect cyclists and help make driving a little more predictable in a very busy city.  It is also an established fact that adding lanes for drivers does not reduce traffic.  One only has to look at Los Angeles to see that in full demonstration.  Having better bike and pedestrian infrastructure also improves safety for the most vulnerable users - slowing down cars literally saves lives.\nI am excited and inspired that Toronto is growing and full of life but that only means more traffic.  The only time we had none was in a global pandemic - not something we want to return to.  Other strategies to have fewer cars in the road are the only way forward.  When do I get to take the Eglinton LRT?  Who knows?\nTransitioning to the proposed 413 highway.  A highway no one wants, that will destroy farmland, negatively impact the environment, and hurt endangered species. I hope those who live in the region that will be paved over read the fine-print on how their property and houses will be bulldozed through appropriation with little notice and no recourse.  Same applies for the expansion of broadband.  Access to the internet is now essential but rather than engaging stakeholders and coming up with reasonable compromises, this government would rather just ram through their plans as quickly as possible before someone can examine what went on behind closed doors (or on personal cell phones).\nUsing legal loopholes to ram through legislation on projects that are so clearly flawed is the opposite of democracy.  But this government has only shown how they can\u2019t work collaboratively, have no desire to use any data to make decisions, and pander only to wedding guests and insiders.  One I only has to look at the Green Belt scandal to see how and why this project is such a priority for the premier.  I wish this government would focus on Provincial\nIssues such as healthcare and education and maybe a future environment that isn\u2019t a traffic and pollution hellscape.  But I guess I can take my $200 vote bribe and easily access marijuana, and beer in my neighbourhood - that is if I don\u2019t get run over by a car getting to the store.\n"

        "comment": "As a resident of Etobicoke-Lakeshore, I am writing to express my disappointment with this government's decision to give the province veto power over the installation of bike lanes, while also possibly removing existing bike lanes.  I feel this is a significant overreach of jurisdiction and power.  These decisions should remain with municipalities, driven by actual data, not the feelings or anecdotal observations of well connected residents.\nMy family uses the bike lane on Bloor St. on a frequent basis.  The bike lanes have provided a safe way for us to get to work, run errands and exercise.  They have also allowed us to reduce our dependence on our car, significantly reducing the number of single vehicle trips we take.  Additionally, my son used the Bloor St bike lane a great deal last summer to get to his summer job in Swansea.  If we were to lose this valuable connection to other parts of the city, it would significantly impact the safety of his ride to work next summer.\nI am continually disappointed (but not surprised) by this government's obsession with driving and beer.  I would ask that focus be given to the health care file, education funding and announcing an opening date for the Eglinton LRT.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is government overreach. How we use local streets is a municipal issue. This also disregards any data and analysis that show these bike lanes are used in greater numbers every year, do not affect vehicle travel times, and create safer streets for everyone outside a vehicle. But I guess the conservatives decided their popular talking point \"facts don't care about your feelings\" doesn't apply here. This is purely a short-sighted, emotional response by an immature, low IQ Premier who is jealous that cyclists don't get stuck in car traffic. Pathetic. Removing bike lanes puts more people in vehicles which in turn makes traffic worse. Seriously, think about it for even half a second. Keep the bike lanes, and build more!\n"

Causing more grid lock issues, increasing gas payments and paying for excess parking fees. All of this is a huge cost add more money, in an already expensive city to live in.\nIf the bike lanes are removed, we probably will think of moving out of Toronto as it is becoming too expensive to live.\nI strongly urge the transportation minister to actually do his study and look at more recent statistics from 2024 and 2023 and not from one from the pandemic at 2021!\nWe understand he gets a privilege from the tax payers money to drive him around and hence he would like the bike lanes removed along his route! Not all of us have that privilege.\nAnd this is coming from a person who drives daily not by choice but due to lack of transportation options to get to work!\nWe strongly encourage biker to have their own bike lane as it is safe for them and they don\u2019t have to weave in and out of traffic!\nIt also encourages cyclists to bike to public transportation increases transit ridership\nLastly IT SAVES LIVES\n"

        "comment": "\"Ontario is looking to fight gridlock and get drivers where they need to go faster.\" This line is the most offensive part of the proposal. This is not a provincial issue, but a direct attack on downtown Toronto.\nWithout safe efficient alternate transportation routes, such as the bike lanes proposed for removal, how should the current cycling population be expected to move around the Toronto? Prioritizing driving suggests more people will be pushed to drive, nullifying any proposed reduction to congestion.\nAnd why should drivers be prioritized? Toronto has a solid public transit network. If drivers are frustrated, they should be considering alternative commute options like the subway or streetcar.\nMore cars = more traffic. We should be celebrating any reduction to number of vehicles on the roads.\n"

I need to be able to get to my doctors' appointments, shopping and banking, safely, just as every driver does. I am 70, and I increasingly feel the need for the added safety of physically separated bike lanes.\nOver all the decades of my life, more lanes for cars have only increased gridlock. Suggesting that more lanes would help with traffic congestion is ignorant of history and naive to the extreme.\nI am fully in favour of solving the congestion problem. I want to see congestion pricing for cars brought in to Toronto. Charging car drivers for the noise their vehicles make would be welcome.  Measures to speed up TTC buses would also help greatly.\nTaking out bike lanes will not help reduce congestion.\n"

I live on Bloor and have seen zero change in car traffic since lanes went in, and emergency vehicles have been able to get through as normal. The only issue with increased congestion is people driving larger cars/trucks (a single person driving a compact car takes up less space on road then giant truck/suv ) and need for more frequent TTC service\nsure there are some bad apples when it comes to bikers, but there are WAY more bad apple drivers, and those drivers kill people\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nAs a new Canadian citizen, it is very disheartening to see this bill being passed. Having moved from Dallas, TX, where there are no bike lanes and a lot of cars, I was pleasantly surprised to see Toronto have alternate means of transport within the city using the Bike Share program and also using your own bikes (If you own them).\nI started using the Bike lanes late last year after I missed the last TTC train from Union station and I started using the Bike share program and it has been a very important means of transport for me within the city. I also noticed that the city has put enormous effort into creating bike lanes and to see them being torn down to be replaced with more cars does not make sense at all.\nThere is also no proper evidence which suggests that removing bike lanes is going to be the solution for traffic gridlocks (See attached link). This just feels like a very useless move where removing the bike lanes themselves is going to cause more gridlock than letting them be.\nI now call Toronto my home and it would be mind boggling and disappointing to see it transform into yet another car-centric city in the North American continent. I sincerely request the representatives to re-consider this bill and put a stop to it. Thank you.\n"

When you build more lanes, they just get filled and then the question is brought up again, why do we have gridlock.\nThe research is clear, keep the bike lanes, build more alternative methods of transportation. As a person who cannot afford a car in these economic times, the act of removing bike lanes is an attack on people like me who commute, do groceries, and get around by bicycle.\nIt's unfortunate that we've seen deaths of cyclists due to lack of bicycle infrastructure, by ripping out established paths, we're just going backwards and more people will be at risk.\n\"If you build it, they will come\" applies to both sides of this equation, but only one side encourages more efficient use of roadways. If there's more car lanes, we'll be right back to a gridlock issue in no time.\nKeep the bike lanes, focus on public transit.\n"

        "comment": "How do you expect people to cycle in Ontario when most places do not have a complete bike lane system in place? There are LESS bike lane options than roads for cars available. As you build MORE bike lanes which increases safety for cyclists and allow them to actually get somewhere they want to go (using/on main roads to provide a direct route) even more people will use them. Data in Toronto and throughout the WORLD indicates irrefutable evidence to support this.\nMost of the bike lanes in Toronto are new and many do not fully connect to other bike infrastructure. Ridership has steeply increased (you can even see this present in the BikeShare usage data). Bloor, University, and Yonge are vital bike lanes people use to get places! Do not remove them.\nIf there were more cycling infrastructure available in Ontario I would travel on my bike to visit family in the suburbs more often than I already do. I still do it, but it's not as safe as it should be because there are no bike lanes connecting us! Lots of people are too scared to cycle but want to, adding these bike lanes have increased comfort and access to allow them to cycle, some still need more bike lanes built so there's more infrastructure keeping them safe on their route before they feel comfortable to travel that way. I commute within Toronto daily on Bloor/Danforth.\nI also drive and want bike lanes to ensure there's A safe distance between my car and cyclists. I don't want them in the regular road instead of a dedicated bike lane as it makes them harder to see and it slows down traffic. I want more people to cycle so that they don't drive cars for every trip contributing to all the CAR traffic further in this city!\nI DEMAND YOU BUILD MORE BIKE LANES AND CYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE. DON'T REMOVE ANYTHING!!! VOTE NO TO THUS BILL!\nPS for those MPPs not paying attention they've snuck in other shit into this legislation beyond the bike lane topic... Please read fully. I also disagree with ALL of those additional shady things they've added.\n"
