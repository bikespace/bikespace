Removing bike lanes and infrastructure will only make congestion worse and biking more dangerous as cyclists are forced onto roads. Bike lanes move more people, more efficiently and help mitigate climate change issues. The only thing removing bike lanes will do is induce even more demand onto roadways, making the problems the bill seeks to address even worse.\n"

        "comment": "The proposed framework under Bill 212, which prioritizes vehicular traffic by potentially removing bike lanes in dense urban environments, is fundamentally misguided. Cities around the world\u2014from Copenhagen to Bogot\u00e1\u2014have demonstrated the immense benefits of prioritizing active transportation like cycling. Yet Ontario seems intent on ignoring decades of research and global best practices, clinging to outdated car-centric policies that exacerbate gridlock rather than solve it.\nIt is well-documented that adding more traffic lanes simply induces greater demand for cars, worsening congestion over time. Conversely, investing in bike infrastructure reduces traffic, improves air quality, and boosts local economies. Cities that commit to robust cycling networks experience healthier residents, safer streets, and fewer emissions\u2014benefits that ripple across entire communities. Why, then, would Ontario regress by removing bike lanes in favor of car traffic, especially in dense urban areas where space is at a premium and public transit and cycling are far more efficient?\nPrioritizing cars in cities undermines environmental goals, ignores the needs of non-drivers, and disregards the economic evidence that shows bike lanes generate more revenue for local businesses than car-dominated streets. Moreover, urban residents are increasingly calling for greener, safer, and more equitable transportation options\u2014not wider roads filled with cars.\nBill 212 is a step backward. In a world grappling with climate change and urban sustainability challenges, doubling down on car-centric infrastructure is not only shortsighted but irresponsible. Ontario must recognize that the future of urban mobility lies in reducing our reliance on cars, not perpetuating it.\n"

Everyone knows where they need to be.\nCycling makes for a healthier body putting less strain on the healthcare sector.\nCycling can get people where they need to go faster.\nCycling is better for the environment.\nOptions: Open Eglinton Cross Town, increase frequency of TTC, lower TTC fairs, promote options to help make people feel safer to ride TTC, look for ways to reduce ride share vehicles in peak rush hour times, allow street construction to continue 24 hours to be able to complete road closures sooner, put a toll on unnecessary vehicles coming into the city like all other major cities in the world do, allow more people to work from home, market 'SHARING the ROADS' - 4 minutes longer in traffic is not a big deal in the grand scheme of things. You could offer a gas rebate for cars that parked at TTC stations and took transit into the city.\nNote, removing bike lanes won't stop the gridlock. Cyclists and electric cyclists will just be on the road taking the space of a vehicle which is hard for the drivers and dangerous for the cyclists.\nThe problem isn't the bike lanes. The problem is the growing population and the amount of cars on the roads...congestion is the cars not the lack of space for them. We need as many avenues to transport our growing population; sidewalks, bike lanes and roadways. Taking transport lanes out is harmful to business, harmful to cyclists and adds an unecessary stress on vehicle drivers who have to manouever around the displaced cyclists.\nWe have to learn to share the roads!\n"

I\u2019ve worked as a courier before Toronto\u2019s extended bike lane network, and after, and I can say without a doubt I feel infinitely safer with the bike lanes. Safer for vehicle motorists, as well as cyclists and micro-mobility users, as everybody\u2019s lives are in danger when motorists are forced into the same roads with no separated lanes or protections. It is next to impossible for me to do my work safely without a legitimate bike lane network. Removing bike lanes is incredibly dangerous and puts my life at risk daily. And I can say with certainty from my experience, the bike lanes on main roads get used extensively and in large numbers, as it\u2019s not just cyclists, but micro-mobility users of any kind using the bike lanes. And with the popularity and prominence of delivery apps, these lanes will only be required and used more and more in the coming years. Please do not make the mistake of removing these new lanes, as I am certain they will be re-instated in the near future. Simple waste of taxpayer dollars, time and resources. And incredible confusion during removal periods.\nMayor Chow and Toronto City Council formally expressed their opposition to Bill 212, and asked the province to withdraw the proposed amendments and work collaboratively with cities to address congestion and road safety.\nAssociation of Municipalities of Ontario, Ontario Professional Planners Institute, Ontario Society of Professional Engineers, and Ontario Traffic Council have all come out against Bill 212.\n120 physicians and researchers wrote a joint letter opposing Bill 212.\nThe words \u201csafety\u201d and \u201chealth\u201d do not appear anywhere in the bike lane sections of Bill 212, and the only consideration to approve or remove bike lanes would be \u201cthe orderly movement of motor vehicle traffic\u201d.\nIt is false that only 1.2% of people bike to work in Toronto, and according to the province\u2019s still confidential data nearly 10% of all trips in the city that end in downtown Toronto are taken by bike or other micro-mobility vehicle.\nFor bike lanes on Bloor, University, and Yonge, there are no feasible parallel alternate routes that wouldn\u2019t also result in the conversion of motor vehicle lanes.\nThe estimated financial impact is $48 million in additional costs to provincial taxpayers for the removal of bike lanes on Bloor, University, and Yonge.\nYou don\u2019t need to be a public health expert or transportation policy expert to understand that Bill 212 will not solve congestion and will put lives at risk.\n"

Also, it will do nothing to improve traffic over the longer term: the proven theory of induced demand decrees that any additional increase in car-oriented infrastructure will inevitably be met by increased usage. As David Beitel, data services lead at Eco-Counter, a Montreal company that collects and analyzes pedestrian and bicycle traffic data, told the CBC, \u201cfor a short period of time, there might be a slightly improved [reduction], but within a year or two, or perhaps three, traffic is as bad or worse than it was before the lanes were added in the first place.\u201d\nPlus you will reduce the number of cyclists, forcing some back into cars as they no longer have safer, protected lanes to travel in. This will increase the number of vehicles on the road, leading to even more congestion.\nAnd you will likely kill or grievously injure more cyclists, all so you can be seen as helping to win the 'war against the car'. Their blood will be on your hands.\nYou stated originally that you would wait to see the data, make a decision based on facts, not hearsay. Please revert to that approach.\n"

        "comment": "There are too many reasons to list here to fully capture my objection to this ridiculous bill. In the simplest terms, this is a colossal waste of tax payer money, especially from a government that likes to pretend it's fiscally responsible (even though it's the largest and most expensive cabinet in provincial history). I understand trying to solve for congestion and agree that is a goal worth pursuing but bike lanes can help with that! With safe, reliable, interconnected infrastructure, many more people will gladly bike in all seasons. How do we know this? Because we've seen the evidence! Look at the data via the expansion of the bike share network. Build it and people will bike safely, especially if it gets them where they need to go faster than driving! Sometimes it takes time for a new equilibrium to sort itself out but people will adjust if you provide the infrastructure to make the necessary changes and know they will be reasonably free from road violence. Each person on a bike saves plenty of room for the remaining people who still want/need to drive. Do you know what doesn't relieve congestion? Major construction projects on huge arteries in the city! Make it make sense. Instead, this government is just trying to stoke another useless culture war to rev up their base and drive Ontarians against each other. Enough with this. Listen to the data. Listen to the people. This doesn't even touch on my objection to this as someone who respects liberty and hates massive government overreach. Focus on provincial issues like investing in our health care system instead of gutting it and putting beer in corner stores. I'm being facetious but I'm just frustrated by this governments insincere, backwards policy time and time again. Acting only out of self-interest and with blatant disregard for the constituents who pay your salaries. Not everyone can drive. Not everyone wants to drive. It is more affordable and often quicker to bike in this city. It should also be safe, just like driving. This is not a war on cars. It is a call for equitable transit options for all Torontonians. If you want have $48 million you can spare and want to relieve congestion, invest it in the TTC then or something even marginally smarter then spending our money CREATING congestion and a culture war that will end up getting people killed. Follow the evidence. Look at the numbers. I mean data on biking, not your poll numbers.\n"

Ten years ago, I was run off the road by an aggressive driver on a stretch of my morning commute where a bike lane abruptly ended, which had left me too afraid to ride a bike in the city since. Now that there are so many safe bike routes in the city, I finally got back on a bike this year after being terrified for all this time. It makes no logical sense to rip out existing infrastructure that keeps cyclists safe, nor does it make sense for the provincial government to be micromanaging municipalities in this way.

        "comment": "I am a Toronto resident and I am writing to express my concerns for Bill 212.\nThe solution to congestion in Ontario is not removing bike lanes in Toronto. Bike lanes in Toronto have nothing to do with provincial flow of traffic and in fact removing them will pose a risk to both drivers and bikers as they negotiate public roads. The Bill also proposes the building of highway 413 through the Greenbelt to alleviate congestion, but the 407 is already an existing and underused highway that needs to be addressed first before spending billions to pave way for another highway that will likely be tolled with the proposal for broadband internet. We need another solution for density in our province.\nImpact of Bike Lanes\nThe province is overstepping its jurisdiction by proposing Bill 212 to remove and assess every bike lane in the city of Toronto. Bike lanes are a matter for municipalities, not provinces. The bike lane across the city, especially the ones on University, Bloor and Yonge are keeping both drivers and bikers safe. I am a driver in the city and wouldn't feel safe without dedicated and protected bike lanes to separate bikers from drivers. Our city also depends on delivery bikers to deliver our foods and goods. This demand for food delivery will not stop because there are no more bike lanes, in fact what is likely to happen is an increase in collisions and fatalities as all road users try to negotiate unclear roads. Removing bike lanes in the city will push our city back decades in creating infrastructure for all. Cities across North America like Montreal, Vancouver, Ottawa, Edmonton, Halifax, New York, Washington, San Francisco, Chicago and many more have extensive bike networks that allow residents to unlock the full potential of their cities.\nImpact of Highway 413\nThe solution to congestion is not a new highway which extensive research by experts has shown will increase congestion even more. Research indicates that expanding road capacity often leads to induced demand,  where increased roadway space attracts more drivers, eventually resulting in congestion levels similar to those before expansion. Experts like Matthew Turner, a professor of economics at Brown University, emphasize that expanding road capacity without considering induced demand overlooks historical patterns of traffic behavior. Turner notes that building more highways has consistently failed to alleviate congestion in the long term. To effectively address traffic congestion, experts advocate for a multifaceted approach that includes investments in public transit like high speed trains, development of cycling infrastructure, and implementation of policies that encourage alternative modes of transportation.\nThere is already an existing and underused highway: the 407. Why is broadband internet needed for this proposed highway if it\u2019s not intended to be used for tolls? If the province is planning on tolling highway 413, it would likely be significantly underused just like the 407. The proposed bill also wants an exemption from the Environmental Assessment Act - why? These environmental acts exist  to assess the potential environmental effects before a project begins. Building a new highway through the Greenbelt will not alleviate congestion in Ontario and in fact could cause more congestion by incentivising people to use their cars more.\nWe need better infrastructure that can manage the density of our province for years to come, not short term solutions like highway 413 and removing bike lanes in Toronto.\n"

I am puzzled about why, with so many issues that are provincial wide, such as lack of family physicians, increased wait times for specialists and surgeries, insufficient beds and places to live for the elderly, issues in the education system, housing unaffordability and availability shortages, that the legislature is spending time, effort, and money, to interfere in the running of one City, a job that belongs to Toronto City Council.\nI am concerned about the short-sighted nature of these proposed changes. They purport to deal with gridlock and congestion, thus saving time for car commuters. Are there high quality, independent studies to back up that claim? Why are the expert opinions of the Association of Municipalities of Ontario, Ontario Professional Planners Institute, Ontario Society of Professional Engineers, and Ontario Traffic Council, who all do not support Bill 212 not being considered? What about the joint letter written by 120 physicians and researchers?\nWhat is the overall plan and vision to ensure the creation of safe, healthy, liveable, and walkable cities? Why are we not modelling ourselves after many European cities, where so many people (who can afford to travel) love to visit, that have mature and robust biking infrastructure?\nI live near the Danforth in East York, and I feel so much safer riding in the protected bike lane. I therefore use my bike much more than I did prior to the installation of the bike lanes. It is terrifying cycling next to cars without infrastructure protection. The number of avoidable deaths of cyclists is heart-breaking. Why is \u201cthe orderly movement of motor vehicle traffic\u201d being prioritized over \u201csafety\u201d and \u201chealth\u201d? Have we lost so much of our humanity that we prefer to save a few minutes of time if it means more families suffer the loss of a loved one?\nI am strongly against this bill and urge the government to take action to support walkers, cyclists, and transit users and to take action to create and encourage the building of sustainable and liveable cities.\nThank you.\n"

Bike lanes are a very low cost, high efficiency mode of transportation that have been demonstrated to reduce traffic and improve patronage at local businesses. They also provide a vital link to transit hubs and cease to function well without a network or \u201cgrid\u201d based approach. This near sighted, bully move on the part of the province will damage the city and waste money on deconstructing a functional transportation solution. We simply need to look around the world to see how well this approach can work. This is not a new problem. When density reaches a critical point we need to move more people on less wheels. This bill is similar to expensive and counterproductive moves made by the Harris government for which we are still paying in the form of expense and congestion (see the Eglinton Crosstown disaster).

Removing bike lanes does not address the root causes of traffic issues and could make congestion worse.\nEnvironmental Impact: The proposed changes could lead to increased car usage, as the removal of bike lanes may make driving more convenient. This could exacerbate traffic congestion and contribute to higher emissions, contradicting environmental goals of reducing carbon footprints and promoting sustainable transportation.\nLoss of Urban Mobility Options: The decision to prioritize car traffic over bike lanes could limit mobility for residents who rely on cycling for commuting or recreation, particularly in an era of rising congestion and public health concerns around sedentary lifestyles.\nUndermines Public Health Goals: Promoting cycling is an important way to improve public health by encouraging physical activity. Removing bike lanes could discourage people from cycling, reducing opportunities for exercise and contributing to sedentary lifestyles, which can lead to long-term health problems.\n"
