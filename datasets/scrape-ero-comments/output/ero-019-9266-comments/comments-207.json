        "comment": "This proposal is flawed and short-sighted. The Government of Ontario should be focused on optimizing transit for people, not for cars. When municipalities make the decision, through their own information-gathering and decision-making processes, to construct new bike lanes according to the transportation needs of their residents, the province should not interfere. For a provincial government that consistently emphasizes the importance of doing away with unnecessary red tape, this policy is incredibly counter-intuitive. This policy would unnecessarily disrupt municipal transit solutions, prioritizing drivers over pedestrian safety, cyclist safety, environmental safety, municipal democratic processes, and climate solutions.\nThe section in the proposal on environmental concerns is laughably short and vague. Considering the developing climate crisis and the well-known environmental issues with car and road-based transportation that go beyond simply carbon emissions, environmental concerns should be one of the core elements of any proposal relating to transportation.\nFurthermore, construction of bike lanes in many cases improves traffic congestion issues. Considering the smaller size of bicycles and bike lanes, when more drivers choose to use bicycles instead of cars they significantly reduce the space required for transportation. This frees up roads for people who are unable or unwilling to use bicycles for transportation. The Government of Ontario should be promoting bike lanes if they value efficient, safe, and effective transportation solutions, not impeding their construction with unnecessary bureaucracy.\nOverall, this policy is counter to Ontario's transportation needs, tramples on municipal democracy, wastes time and money, and would be ineffective at achieving the results it aims to be prioritizing. Thus, it should be rejected.\n"

        "comment": "Firstly, the province needs to stay in its lane. Leave municipalities to run themselves.\nSecondly, pretty much all existing studies on transport safety and reduction of gridlock supports separate bike lanes. Cars cause traffic, pollution, and contribute to the climate change that is increasingly looking like it will become an existential threat. Bikes don't do any of those things, and the bike lanes are a crucial part of making streets safer for everyone.\nIt's hard to see policy like this and not think that Ontario's premier and elected governance are abusing their positions, and wasting our tax dollars and time.\nWith the utmost disgust that I even have to write this,\nA citizen of Ontario\n"

Remove parking from these roads. It accommodates so few cars and can be absorbed on side streets. Don't risk lives with knee-jerk policy decisions\n"

        "comment": "Hi, I am a student who lives in the Annex. As others such as the Annex BIA has said, please do not get rid of the bike lanes! I think that removing bike lanes will not decongest traffic as some people may decide to drive instead, creating more traffic as cars are bigger than bikes. Removing bike lanes also does not stop cyclists from cycling on Bloor St. It just stops them from having a safer ride. Moreover, the evidence provided from the Annex BIA has shown that profits of businesses off Bloor St. since the bike lanes have been put into place has increased substantially. Lastly, cycling is much better for health compared driving (this is obvious) so if we are about the wellbeing and health of our society, bike lanes should prevail.\n"

It is fundamentally biased towards car owners, which means it underrepresents the needs of lower income residents. Destroying recently constructed infrastructure on a whim is only going to increase congestion in the short term, and not relieve congestion in the long term. This is politicized government overreach, leave it in the hands of the municipalities.\n"

Decisions about bike lanes on local roads are best made by local governments, who understand the need of their municipalities. This change in regulation will only increase bureaucracy, thus increasing cost, which in the end must be paid for by an already overburdened Ontario taxpayer. I therefore urge you to repeal this proposed change to the Highway Traffic Act.\n"

Our main route is along a path away from the road, which is lovely, but when there was construction on the highway, our path was temporarily re-routed to a separated lane on the street.\nWould it then be the case with this legislation that bike paths like this would just disappear because of the red-tape of even temporarily moving them and sharing the road? The construction lasted 2 years!\nLet's not make stupid rules just to divide people and rile us all up. Cyclists drive cars, and drivers ride bikes.\n"

        "comment": "I\u2019m opposed to the idea of removing existing bike lanes, or preventing new ones, in some circumstances as proposed by Bill 212.\nMore bike lanes actually means better traffic flow for motorists.\nBike lanes encourage more people to travel by bike as it is safer for cyclists to be in bike lanes than in car lanes. And encouraging more people to use bicycles helps reduce the number of vehicles on the roads, meaning there is less congestion and better traffic flow for those who want, or need, to take their cars, as well as for emergency vehicles.\nBike lanes that are separated from car lanes also help reduce the risk of accidents for motorists. With cyclists in their own bike lanes, motorists don\u2019t have to go around cyclists who are in car lanes.  Going around cyclists increases the risk, for the motorists, of accidents with other cars.\nAlso, with cyclists in bike lanes, motorists are not stuck behind cyclists in car lanes.  Cyclists in car lanes mean that motorists are going much slower than if the cyclists were out of the car lanes and into bike lanes.\nThere are also strong economic incentives. Dedicated bike lanes make it easier for people to cycle, encouraging a more active lifestyle, meaning fewer emissions of greenhouse gases and improved air quality;  All of those elements contribute to reducing public health costs.   Studies have also shown that after the implementation of bike lanes in cities,  there is increase in foot traffic, contributing to vibrant street life and boosted retail activity\n"

        "comment": "I do not support this bill.\nSafe and well designed bicycle lanes Encourage people to reduce vehicle dependent travel particularly in local areas. Municipalities have better knowledge and resources to implement this. Requiring the province to approve these projects is unnecessary and creates more red tape.\nMore people riding their bikes means they are not driving their cars. If they are not driving their cars then there are fewer cars on the road. Fewer cars on the road ease congestion. This is not a difficult concept.\nI do not support the creation of a new highway, the 413. This plan will destroy needed green space surrounding the greater toronto area. Green space helps capture carbon and excess rainfall. There is already an express highway that is underutilized, the 407.\n"

        "comment": "I am a resident in the Yonge Summerhill corridor and have been for the past 6 years.  Ever since the bike lanes have been installed, the traffic on Yonge is completely untenable.  Mostly I walk, but when I need my car to pick up something I can't carry, it will take me at least 3 times as long to go to either the Canadian Tire on Yonge or the LCBO at Summerhill than it did when I first moved in 6 years ago.  Often when I do walk, I can walk faster from Yonge/Davenport to Yonge Scrivener Square than drivers.  Does that make sense?  Please consider removing the bike lanes!  The congestion, noise and pollution for us local residents is extremely concerning!!\n"

        "comment": "I am strongly against this legislation.\nI am completely against enacting an exemption from the Environmental Assessment Act for enterprises, activities, proposals, plans and programs for or related to Highway 413. We absolutely need to maintain environmental assessments, we aren't doing enough to safeguard against climate change so let's not do even less.\nThis is a short-sighted policy that will result in disastrous outcomes for the environment.The proposal that this highway should be exempted from any environmental assessment to expedite development suggests the government doesn\u2019t care whatsoever about the environment and, again, is not serious about eliminating gridlock: more roads means more cars which means more traffic. I doubt any urban planners, engineers or other credentialed experts were consulted at all in the creation of this bill.\nAnd leave the bike lanes alone. First of all, why is the Ontario government interfering in a city's business? Toronto residents and municipal government are more than capable of deciding for themselves. Toronto needs more transportation options not less, and we all need to decrease our driving and reliance on fossil fuels. The only way to reduce gridlock and traffic is to reduce cars. Successful ways to do this would be adding more bike lanes and expanding transit to make cities less car-centric, implementing congestion charges and other policies to help get people out of cars and using alternative forms of transportation.\nBlatantly ignoring evidence based solutions because the Premier has decided he has a beef with bike lanes for some reason will make gridlock worse, not better, and your time and our tax payer money would be better spent addressing issues like Healthcare and Education, that are actually the province's responsibility, instead of micromanaging municipal affairs. If the Premier wants to be mayor of Toronto so badly, he should resign and run in the next election, and leave being Premier to someone who knows what they are doing.\n"

        "comment": "Dear Mr. Ford,\nI\u2019m writing to let you know how I disagree with your decision to make approving and removing bike lanes a provincial matter instead of a municipal one. I hope you reverse this decision.\nI\u2019ve lived in Toronto for 13 years and the most convenient and affordable way to get around for me has been by bicycle. The Bloor bike lane improved my commute a great deal, as I no longer had to share a lane with cars and worry about getting hit by them. I also drive a car regularly and I much prefer roads having bike lanes so it lowers the risk of me hitting a cyclist, I hope most sensible and compassionate people do. When I first moved to Toronto I was hit by a car on a street that didn\u2019t have a bike lane. I definitely aim to use bike lanes whenever possible for my own personal safety as well as to stay out of the way of cars.\nYour politics and rhetoric lead me to believe you don\u2019t necessarily care about the safety and wellbeing being of cyclists, so I won\u2019t try to compel you that way. So let\u2019s talk about what really matters to you: cars. I just don\u2019t see how this will help congestion. It will mean cars will be sharing lanes with bikes, which will obviously slow things down. Plus imagine what a nightmare it will be for you to spend our tax payer money to remove our perfectly good infrastructure. Construction projects led by the province tend to go over budget and miss deadlines - do you really want to create traffic mayhem in our cities for no reason? At the expense of taxpayers no less.\nAlso I would have assumed you don\u2019t believe in \u201cBig Government\u201d doesn\u2019t the province taking control over municipal government decisions go against that?\nYou have made a lot of questionable decisions lately, Ontario place, the science centre\u2026 it\u2019s too bad you are at war with the biggest city of your province, instead of trying to invest in it and make it better.\nPlease leave our bike lanes alone, or better yet, give us more. Please stop giving sweetheart deals to your developer friends. Please help us have a city that is designed for its residents.\nI hope you see what a bad legacy you are creating for yourself and change course. You have made this province worse (specifically Toronto) and at the expense of its citizens. You are an embarrassment to your office.\n"

Why are there no studies cited on the impact of bike lanes? Why are the many studies on this topic not cited? Why do we want to add more red tape? This is terrible policy, please don't do this. Invest the energy and money into things known to reduce congestion such as public transit and generally offering alternatives to driving.

Many local trips can be made on bicycles, including commutes, errands, etc, provided there is safe infrastructure to do so. When communities make that a priority, the Ontario government should not swoop in and veto - or remove - that infrastructure. It's simply not in the best interest of Ontarians to reduce cycling infrastructure. Our health, the health of the environment, and our gridlock all depend on cycling infrastructure. This bill is anti-Ontarian.\n"
