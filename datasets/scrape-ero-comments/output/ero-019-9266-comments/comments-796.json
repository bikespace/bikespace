With Toronto\u2019s current network of bike lanes, I no longer fear for my life throughout the majority of my travel time. I fully support the progress that the city has made in developing cycling infrastructure without provincial interference.\nI also wanted to add that I vehemently do not support any other aspects of this Bill. I do not support Highway 413. I do not support changing the rules around environmental assessments or seizure of people's homes for highway development.\n"

        "comment": "The proposed framework is regressive policy that is inconsistent with the Province's own recently updated Provincial Policy Statement which promotes active transportation and compact built form (including walkable neighbourhoods with destinations easily accessible by transit and active transportation). The framework would move the Province and particularly the City of Toronto away from internationally recognized best practices for urban transportation that can accommodate current and future population growth while also supporting public health, emissions targets, economic growth, and other important public policy objectives.\nI am a resident of Toronto and I use walking, transit, cycling, and my car to get around. When I am cycling, I choose routes that have bike lanes to keep myself safe. I regularly use the bike lanes on Bloor, Yonge, and University to travel to and from work, to visit friends, and to do my shopping and errands. When I am driving my car, I also prefer routes with bike lanes so that the movement of cyclists around me is more predictable. On most downtown streets without bike lanes, the lanes are too narrow to safely pass a cyclist, which creates challenging and sometimes dangerous situations.\nIn my opinion this policy is not good for the residents of Ontario, and specifically Toronto in regards to the proposed amendment.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose Bill 212 and urge the province to withdraw the proposed amendments, which prioritize motor vehicle traffic over public safety, increase costs for taxpayers, undermine local decision-making, and threaten environmental protection.\n1. Cyclist Safety Concerns\nBill 212 fails to address the critical issue of cyclist safety. The bill prioritizes the \u201corderly movement of motor vehicle traffic\u201d while completely omitting considerations for safety and health. This oversight is alarming given the evidence that protected bike lanes save lives, reduce collisions, and improve road safety for all users. Respected organizations\u2014including 120 physicians and researchers\u2014have warned that removing bike lanes will have serious public health consequences.\nThe claim that only 1.2% of Torontonians bike to work is misleading; the province\u2019s own confidential data shows that nearly 10% of trips ending in downtown Toronto are made by bike or other micromobility vehicles. Bike lanes on Bloor, University, and Yonge are essential to the city\u2019s transportation network, with no feasible parallel routes that wouldn\u2019t also require the removal of motor vehicle lanes. Removing these lanes would not only endanger cyclists but also worsen congestion, making roads less safe for everyone.\n2. Impacts to Local Businesses\nBill 212 would significantly harm local businesses by reducing access for people traveling by bike. Businesses along major corridors like Yonge and Bloor West rely on bike infrastructure to bring in customers.\nAccording to researchers at the University of Toronto, businesses on Yonge Street would lose, on average, half of their potential customers arriving by bike. Businesses on Bloor West would lose, on average, 56% of their potential bike customers.\nMoreover, the bill would limit access for over 600,000 people in Toronto who currently use bikes to reach jobs, schools, healthcare, stores, and entertainment. The average person affected would lose access to 84,000 jobs and destinations, devastating the economic vitality of local communities. Reducing bike access would harm not only small businesses but also the broader economy by restricting consumer and employee mobility.\n3. Added Costs and Undermining Local Decision-Making\nBill 212 imposes unnecessary costs and red tape on municipalities while stripping them of their authority to make decisions about local infrastructure. By centralizing control, the bill undermines municipal democracy and ignores the expertise of city planners and engineers, not to mention the decisions of democratically elected local representatives.\nThis is deeply ironic given the province\u2019s Ministry of Red Tape Reduction, which ostensibly seeks to reduce administrative burdens.\nThe financial impact of removing bike lanes on Bloor, University, and Yonge alone is estimated at $75 million (including sunk costs)\u2014an enormous and unjustified cost to provincial taxpayers. Rather than forcing cities to tear up critical infrastructure, the province should be working collaboratively with municipalities to address congestion and improve road safety.\n4. Highway 413 and Greenbelt Impacts\nBill 212 also includes provisions to fast-track Highway 413 and weaken protections for the Greenbelt, threatening environmental sustainability and farmland preservation. Highway 413 would destroy critical habitats, increase urban sprawl, and pave over valuable agricultural land, undermining Ontario\u2019s commitments to combat climate change and protect natural resources.\nInvesting in highways over sustainable transportation options, such as public transit and active transportation infrastructure, moves Ontario further away from achieving its environmental goals. This short-sighted approach not only harms the Greenbelt but also jeopardizes long-term economic and ecological resilience.\nConclusion\nInstead of imposing costly, unsafe, and environmentally harmful measures, the province should collaborate with municipalities to develop sustainable solutions that improve congestion, protect natural heritage systems, and enhance road safety for all users. Bill 212 is a step backward and does not reflect the priorities of Ontarians or the evidence on effective urban transportation and land use planning.\n"

        "comment": "As non-cyclist invested in efficient, varied & safe transportation options living in Toronto, I strongly object to Bill 212. Bike lanes are essential for the daily commute of many, allowing people to navigate through traffic safely, while reducing pollution as well as congestion on public transportation and other forms of travel.\nRemoving bike lanes would force cyclists in front of cars taking up the whole lane (as is their right) which slows everything down, increasing the risk of accidents and pushing other cyclists back into cars, which would only exacerbate traffic and emissions.\nIn contrast, the city's existing bike lanes on streets like University, College, Yonge, and Bloor-Danforth have shown their value in supporting safe and efficient commuting.\nInstead of wasting time & money dismantling these infrastructures, I believe the government should prioritize investing in public infrastructure that supports an array of transportation types to create a healthier, greener, and less congested city.\nRemoval of the bike lanes incentivizes the addition of cars to the roads which only marginally decreases gridlock for them while making travel harder for everyone else.\nStop Bill 212.\n"

        "comment": "This is a ridiculous proposal which solves nothing and costs a vast sum of taxpayers' money. Converting bike lanes to regular traffic lanes won't solve any traffic congestion. Hundreds of cities worldwide have already proven that increasing the number of lanes shall not reduce commute time. The problem is never due to not enough traffic lanes, but TOO MANY CARS, especially in Toronto. This expensive proposal will waste our hard-earned money for NOTHING, mark my word. Furthermore, reducing bike lanes will consequently reduce the number of bikers as well, causing more people to drive a car instead of riding a bike, which further increases the number of vehicles on the road, which further worsens traffic. As a result, it will only make traffic worse instead of improving it due to the increase in the number of vehicles on the road, you may also mark my word for that. We do not understand the purpose of this proposal. Last but not least, converting lanes takes time in terms of years. Thus we can foresee that in the next few years, traffic downtown will be hell for any commuter due to: 1. more vehicles on the road and fewer bikers; 2. construction sites occupying space. Therefore, what is the point? As proven by many countries worldwide such as the Netherlands and Japan, there is only one true solution to traffic - REDUCE THE NUMBER OF VEHICLES ON THE ROAD. Yet this proposal suggests the opposite. Fix TTC, build more efficient subways, and incentify drivers to take alternative transportation such as bikes and public transit, then we will truly be free from traffic congestion. I hope this comment will find you well, and I hope that our provincial government will listen to us. Please don't force your wrong perspective of traffic on us Torontonians. Much appreciated.\n"

        "comment": "I am a Toronto citizen, and I am strongly opposed to this proposal for the following reasons:\n1. Bike lanes do not cause gridlock or traffic congestion. The attached article cites several studies that speak to this point.\n2. Removing bike lanes along these well-travelled parts of the city will make it harder for people to commute via bike, potentially increasing the amount of people who will commute by car and increasing traffic.\n3. There are people who will still commute and travel via bike on these major city streets. By removing these bike lanes, you are sending a message that you do not care for these cyclists safety or well-being. It is not hard to imagine that more cyclists will be injured and/or killed as a result of this bill should it pass.\n4. Toronto City council opposes this plan with a strong majority. The city doesn't want this, and the province should not interfere.\n5. This is an extremely expensive project. Spending tax dollars on something citizens and the municipal government do not want is a gross misuse of public funds.\n6. The provincial government should not have veto power over the bike lanes that municipalities want to build. Government officials serve their constituents, and should not be prevented from increasing access to safe cycling infrastructure if that's what a municipality's citizens desire.\nIt is an embarrassment that the Premier has proposed such a bill, and is using the government's time and resources on a motion that clearly does not have the well-being of Ontario citizens in mind.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose Bill 212 and would like to express my serious concerns with the contents of this Act.\n1. Though I understand the frustration of drivers, it is well-established that more lanes of traffic do not reduce congestion (see the works of Jane Jacobs and other prominent urban planners). Reduced congestion will only be achieved by promoting other means of transportation (including public transit, cycling and walking) and shifting towards greater decentralization in our urban design. The exorbitant cost to tax payers of removing bicycle lanes (estimated at 48-75 million dollars) could instead be used, for example, to improve our inadequate public transit system. Given that 28% of Torontonians don\u2019t own a car, rising to more than half of those living in the downtown core, why are cars owners being privileged? The Ministry of Transportation is responsible for serving all people of Ontario. In a time when other world class cities such as Paris, London, New York City and Copenhagen are focused on reducing cars, why is Toronto trying to expand car use??\n2. Getting places faster should NEVER be prioritized over safety. Bike lanes save lives. This is an uncontested fact. It is SHAMEFUL that this is not by itself a sufficient argument for their value. Yet the proposed bill includes no language that references the safety of road users as a consideration in bike lane approval.\n3. The figures about current bike lane use have been widely contested but more importantly, our goal should be to increase bike lane usage. I have seen this happen steadily as bike infrastructure becomes more complete but it is still woefully lacking. The main barrier to bicycling for many people is safety concerns. Given the urgency of the climate crisis and critical need to reduce emissions, our focus should be improving bicycle infrastructure not reducing it.\n4. Finally, setting aside all arguments on the value of bicycle lanes or where they should be placed, ultimately this is a municipal decision. There is no possible rationale for the provincial government to be interfering in municipal decisions, made by democratically elected leadership through a lengthy thoughtful process. The question of where bike lanes should be placed is an important one that should consider and balance the needs of all road users. No one is suggesting that all streets should have a bike lane and in some cases, side streets (as part of a complete network) may be the more appropriate choice. I frequently use the Shaw St. bike lane and see no reason why there should be a bicycle lane placed on Ossington St. (a larger nearby street which runs parallel). However, this is a decision that should be made municipally. As a resident of Toronto, I would not begin to speculate about the appropriate role for bike lanes in other parts of the province and I cannot understand why those outside Toronto should have any involvement in these decisions for Toronto. This Bill represents an unprecedented anti-democratic overreach by the provincial government and I urge you not to approve this bill.\n"

I commuted on a bike for 15 years prior to getting a car beginning in the late 1980's.\nI do not see more than a couple of bikes per day. I see more food service electric bikes in the bike lanes than commuters on bicycles.\nI have concern that turning onto a main street like Bloor St from a side street:\nWhen I am driving south on Brentwood Road North and approaching Bloor Street to turn west onto Bloor Street West, I cannot see oncoming traffic when cars are parked on the north side of Bloor St facing west.  I HAVE to proceed into the bike lane to look for westward oncoming traffic.\nSeniors and people with mobility issues are now limited from accessing businesses on Bloor St because parking spots have dramatically decreased.\nMy mother is turning 90 years old in 5 weeks.  She is an active person.  However, she is unable to exit from the passenger side of the car  onto the sidewalk if there is bike lane infrastructure like a concrete curb or if there are lane separators impeding her access.  My mother also drives.  She swims 7 days per week in the summer and Mon-Friday throughout the fall, winter and spring but she cannot open the driver's side door and pull out her walker onto Bloor St.  Therefore, now, with the bike lanes installed, she is unable to go to the green grocer in the Kingsway to pick up her fruit and veggies.  She is forced to be driven there and to sit in the car.  She is still obligated to pay her taxes, but her rights are now limited by the bike lanes.   Before the bike lanes were installed she was able to open the passenger door and step up on the sidewalk or she could drive herself and get out of the driver's side of the car.\nThe delays on Bloor St now are unprecedented and the bike lanes are not being utilized.  I am awake early in the morning and I still see buses packed with passengers at 5:30 am before the subway is running.   I don't see any bikes in the bike lanes at 5:30 am, even during the beautiful weather.  I see a lot of people on transit.\nAlso, I am concerned that I am unable to easily see oncoming traffic when I turn westbound onto Bloor Street West from Brentwood Road North.  I am unable to see beyond  1) the bike lanes and 2) cars parked on Bloor St, SOUTH of the bike lanes.\nTravel Time from the Kingsway to Bloor West Village\nNow the travel time is greatly increased from the Kingsway to Bloor West Village.\n"

As proposed, Bill 212 threatens to undermine public health, safety, and efforts to combat both climate change and congestion.\nAs a young resident of Midtown Toronto, the safe street infrastructure and bike lanes that would be removed due to Bill 212 will have a harmful impact in my community. I depend on public transit and walking to go to work, go to school, get to appointments and run errands in this city. Safe street infrastructure on Midtown Yonge has vastly improved the safety of pedestrians, cyclists and transit users like myself from speeding, dangerous drivers.\nThis is a matter of safety for my community. While I do not bike, I do walk in my community and constantly face the risk of injury and death when crossing heavily trafficked corridors on foot. At the same time, many of my friends use BikeShare to get around the city, and their safety and lives depend on the type of infrastructure that Bill 212 promises to remove.\nBill 212 promises to undo efforts to increase road safety and instead further the crisis of injury and death on our streets. I urge members to consider the human toll that the passage of this Bill would produce, and instead pursue evidence-based solutions to congestion. Provincial ransit projects like the Eglinton Crosstown are 4 years late on their opening date, while frequent all-day two-way GO expansion remains a delayed pipe dream. We need evidence-based solutions to congestion: investment into public transit service, the delivery of long-overdue transit projects, bike infrastructure, and deliver on affordable housing in our urban areas.

Recently I had occasion to walk on the North sidewalk on Bloor Street, from West of Royal York Road, all the way to Prince Edward Drive. During this stroll, I saw EXACTLY ONE (1) BIKE being ridden in the bike lane !! I also saw many cars parked in the bike lane, every driver risking a $00 fine.\nMy interest in the bike lane issue is way more than casual. I have developed a design for an Elevated Bicycle Expressway (bikeway) located in air space above major urban roadways. This elevated bikeway provides four (4) weather-sheltered lanes for muscle-only bikes. It completely eliminated any need for surface-level bike lanes carved out of motor road lane and parking space.\nA prominent Toronto cycling advocate told me that he dislikes my elevated bikeway proposal, because it is BOTH BIKE-FRIENDLY AND CAR-FRIENDLY !! In my opinion, most biking advocates HATE THE PRIVATE CAR WAY MORE THAN THEY LOVE THE BICYCLE.\nI encourage Ontario Premier Doug Ford to inform himself about my elevated bikeway proposal. The elevated bikeway is a powerful challenge to cycling fanatics who see surface-level bike lanes as a great way to make car drivers miserable, by increasing motor road traffic congestion.\nI attach file Elevated Bicycle Expressway (bikeway) - 20221007.odt.pdf\n"
