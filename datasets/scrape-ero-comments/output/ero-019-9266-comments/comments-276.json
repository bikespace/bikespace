        "comment": "Bike lanes can decrease traffic: it's that simple. Cars move a tiny fraction of the number of people bikes, transit, and walking move on major streets, especially in more central areas. However, this requires a biking network: just one bus line won't have many users, but a transit network often can get very crowded, especially the ultra-high capacity subway lines. Worse yet, every single one of the streets targeted in this plan has a subway running under it, which moves as much traffic as a 25-lane highway! Maybe fix that before spending money on the tiny portion of Torontonians who drive to work. There's a reason Annex BIA is up in arms over this decision: bikes are also good for business! The bike lanes also provide a barrier between fast-moving cars and pedestrians, allowing for a safer and more pleasant walking experience.\nDoug Ford doesn't care about that though: his commute by car got a minute longer, so instead of looking for real solutions he decides to find something else, even if that costs lives. This conservative government will always look for somebody to blame, instead of taking accountability for their lack of vision, failure to execute anything useful (can't even open the Eglinton and Finch west LRTs), and blatant corruption around Therme and the Greenbelt.\nInstead of spending millions to rip out our bike lanes that the city spent millions building and designing, we should look for real solutions to gridlock like rapid expansion of GO transit, bus lanes, more biking infrastructure, and providing other viable alternatives to driving. We know from so many other places in the world that solving traffic is not done by prioritizing cars, it's solved by taking people out of their cars and having them use a different mode. This has worked around the world: why is Ontario so special?\n"

And outlaw film shoots that obstruct lanes as well? Instantly tow courier vehicles that park illegally?\nYou need to show the math that bike lanes are the problem, instead of putting cyclist lives at risk for cheap political points. And don't borrow $200 from my kids to bribe me for my vote.\n"

Studies show that these bike lanes have NO EFFECT on congestion and the removal is a massive waste of taxpayer money and you are willingly putting people's lives at risk. From now on as a cyclist, I will take the lane and everyone behind me will have to wait FOR MY SAFETY.  I will vote against you in the election and I will protest in the streets. This is a human rights violation.\n"

You weren't elected as a mayor so stop roleplaying as one.\nBike lanes save time and money, this is common sense. Ripping them up is a self-inflicted injury that only individuals with room-temperature IQ levels would support.\nDoug, heed our words: Go away. Hands off our streets.\n"

Maybe use the 3 billion dollar bribe you are handing out in the new year.  Another waste of taxpayer dollars and I will never vote for you because of it!! Doug Ford is not the mayor of Toronto!!\n"

The explicit targeting of the Bloor Street, Yonge Street and University Avenue is the province of Ontario trying to exert influence over Toronto in unnecessary and harmful manor.\nAdditionally, while the legislation states the goal is to reduce traffic congestion, this will have the opposite effect. Well-planned bike lanes reduce traffic congestion by providing alternatives that take less space.\n"

        "comment": "I am a frequent driver and occasional cyclist. I also travel a lot for a living. In my travels I\u2019m always struck by how most city\u2019s have overcome congestion and limits of the cities by DECREASING vehicle traffic and ENCOURAGING cycling, transit and other forms of transportation. To move a city into the future is to make it more prosperous by making it less about vehicles and more about the people in it. So many international cities have done so to great effect. Seems so dated and misinformed for us to remove recent improvements to the city such as these bike lanes.\nRemoving bike lanes will not improve traffic, it\u2019s a quick fix for a much larger problem. And making it more dangerous\nMy partner was hit my a car in this city and suffered serious injuries. Sadly a story all too familiar in our city. Bike lanes and bike infrastructure encourages more people to cycle, makes our city safer and less congested by encouraging people to use other forms of transportation.\nI want Toronto and the Province of Ontario to move forward into the future with the rest of the world, not stick to an old idea that everyone just has to drive cars everywhere and plug up this city.\nAlso - why not let the voters in Toronto decide this, not the province. I\u2019d like my tax dollars to be spent not wasted. Seems like a waste to use them to remove recently infrastructure rather than continue on a path forward.\n"

        "comment": "Please do not remove the bike lanes. The problem is not the bikes. The problem is the volume of cars. And the number of cars is only going up. So the system that is not working currently (eg. People driving single occupancy vehicles) will obviously continue to get worse. Why not move towards alternative solutions?\nI frequently bike from my home near Bloor West to the financial district. As a busy Mom of 2 small kids who works full time, it is great to be able to combine exercise with commuting. Otherwise, I probably wouldnt have time to exercise. This way, I get to work energized for the day.\nThere is so much research showing the positive impact for citizens and cities to have bicycle lanes and transit options. It does not make sense to move backwards.\n"
