Thank you!\nGiven that the City of Toronto is unable to understand that maximizing the throughput of traffic on our major roads is essential to support the functioning of this rapidly growing city, I am grateful that you have the courage to step in.\nRemoval of the underused bike lanes on routes like Bloor St W. and anywhere else directly on the subway lines is essential.  If there's construction or any issue on the subway the whole area grinds to a standstill.\nThanks again for a timely intervention!\n"

        "comment": "Investing in a Sustainable, Safe, and Vibrant Toronto: The Case for Retaining Bike Lanes\nAs someone who grew up in the Netherlands, I have seen firsthand the transformative impact a robust cycling infrastructure can have on a city. In the Netherlands, cycling is more than a mode of transportation; it is a way of life that fosters independence, reduces congestion, and improves quality of life. At just 11 years old, I could cycle independently throughout my city, an experience that shaped my confidence and mobility. This same potential exists for Toronto, and it has been heartening to see bike lanes encouraging parents in my neighborhood to cycle with their children to school. However, these gains are now under threat, as the Ontario government proposes to remove existing bike lanes\u2014a step backward that would undermine Toronto\u2019s progress toward a safer, more sustainable urban environment.\nThe stakes of this decision are personal for me. My former PhD supervisor died in a tragic cycling accident on Avenue Road in 2006 while on his way to the University of Toronto. His death was preventable; it was a direct consequence of inadequate cycling infrastructure. For years after that accident, my wife and I stopped cycling altogether, even though we had been year-round cyclists who relied on bikes for everything from commuting to grocery shopping. The lack of protected bike lanes made cycling unsafe, and we, like many others, turned to cars for our daily transportation needs.\nThe recent installation of protected bike lanes in Toronto has changed everything for me. These lanes have given me the confidence to return to cycling, replacing many trips I would have otherwise made by car. Whether I\u2019m commuting to lectures at the University, running errands, or picking up food from restaurants, cycling has become a viable and often faster alternative. More importantly, protected bike lanes have allowed me to share this activity with my special needs son. At 14 years old, he cannot cycle independently, but with the help of a bicycle trailer, we now enjoy safe rides to the lake, the Martin Goodman Trail, and even Tommy Thompson Park. These bike lanes have opened up parts of the city we would never have visited by car.\nAs Toronto grows denser, accommodating an ever-increasing number of cars is simply not sustainable. Streets have finite capacity, and reverting to a car-centric model will only lead to more congestion, more emissions, and less livable neighborhoods. While removing bike lanes may provide temporary relief to drivers frustrated by traffic, it is not a long-term solution. Experience shows that car traffic behaves like water: drivers will simply reroute to streets like Bloor or others, quickly negating any perceived gains. Meanwhile, as new condos rise along major corridors, thousands of new residents will add to the strain. Without alternatives like cycling, the result will be gridlock.\nBuilding a cycling culture takes time, but the benefits are clear. In the Netherlands, safe and accessible bike infrastructure has replaced countless car trips, creating vibrant cities where cycling, walking, and public transportation seamlessly coexist with driving. This is not about eliminating cars but about providing choices. Each trip I make involves a decision: Is driving, walking, public transit, or cycling the best option? Increasingly, the answer is cycling\u2014not only because it is often the fastest but because it is healthier, more sustainable, and less stressful.\nRemoving bike lanes would be a grave mistake, undoing years of progress and sending the message that safety and sustainability are not priorities. Instead, we need to focus on moving people and goods, not just cars and trucks. Bike lanes make cycling an option for many who would otherwise drive, reducing congestion and emissions while improving mobility for everyone\u2014including drivers.\nMr. Ford, I implore you to reconsider this proposal. Toronto has already crossed the threshold where car-centric policies are no longer viable in the city\u2019s core. Protected bike lanes are an investment in a better future\u2014a future where people can move safely, efficiently, and sustainably. Please do not take this step backward. Instead, let us continue building a Toronto that works for everyone.\n"

        "comment": "It will be devastating if Bill 212 is passed. 2024 has been the deadliest year for cycling deaths in Toronto. I lost a friend who was killed by motorists while cycling, all because she was trying to get home and the street did not have bicycle lanes. More people will unfortunately die if Bill 212 is passed.  Since when does saving up to 30 seconds of commuting time for motorists become a priority over saving Ontarians' lives? 68% of Ontarians ride their bike at least once a month. The amount that this bill will cost taxpayers to remove pre-existing bike lanes makes no sense.\nAs Premier Doug Ford stated, \u201cYou\u2019re nervous when there\u2019s no bike lanes. At least I was. We have to do everything we can to make sure there\u2019s never a death in the city. One death is way too many when it comes to bicycle riders.\u201d\n- Doug Ford (2017).\n"

        "comment": "Horrible idea. The idea that you can have a bustling, lively, busy area, that is car-first and also doesn't have a lot of traffic, is a total fantasy. It's never been done and this act will not do it. It will put more bikes in car lanes, slowing them down. It will put more cars on the road, slowing them down. Take a look at any existing 2 lane road without bike lanes. There is only ever a single lane of car movement, and the righthand lane is always, ALWAYS, either parked/stopped cars and/or cyclists. But any research or assessment of existing roadways would show this, so I assume this is known information which is somehow not sufficient. If you want less traffic, you need other, non-car ways of getting people moving.\nFurther, there are serious costs associated with this, making it fiscally irresponsible and a total waste of taxpayer money.\nAnother issue is the big government overreach that this necessarily entails. Why should all communities in the whole province be planned under the same set of rules? Are small towns just little versions of a big city? Is a big city just a large version of a small town? The idea that the province thinks that they should be the same thing makes absolutely no sense.\nUnless there's some predilection towards construction for construction's sake, the bike lane removal will slow down traffic, after which cyclists in car lanes will slow down traffic further. I have not begun to mention how much more dangerous this will make roads for cyclists, which is surely something to worry about, if you've ever seen how many cyclists use these lanes during busy hours, it would be no small thing for which this government would be responsible.\nThere is an interesting confluence here as well of giving permission to blatantly ignore environmental assessment for highway 413 and the environmental impact of discouraging cycling, and encouraging car use. This government's disregard for environmental concerns is concerning, and something which I vehemently oppose.\nRemember every time you got stuck behind a cyclist in your car going much slower than you wanted to. This is the future of traffic, this is exactly what you are voting for, and exactly what you wanted, and exactly what you are going to get. Just don't say you didn't know!\n"

        "comment": "The bike lanes on Bloor have caused massive congestion on Bloor especially between Islington and Keele that I have witnessed first hand. Yesterday as I was just trying to get onto Bloor there was a back up on Gardenvale because of too much congestion on Bloor.  In the middle of day there is bumper to bumper traffic stretching from Islington to Keele.  When I finally managed to get onto Bloor I noticed the bike lanes were empty as usual and then a single bike rider rode by on the sidewalk.  After getting onto Bloor from Gardenvale I quickly got off Bloor to taking Montgomery up to Dundas.  Bloor has become a road you avoid at all cost because the bike lanes have caused such severe and unnecessary congestion.\nBike lanes have a place but not on the main arteries on the city--they should be moved to secondary streets.  If you want more safety for bikes put them on secondary streets where cars are travelling at a slower rate of speed so if there is an accident you don't necessary have a fatality.  Remove the bike lanes whatever the cost.\nThe traffic in those bike lanes is non-existent and has been a failed experiment--get rid of them and getting Bloor moving again.\n"

        "comment": "I am outraged by Bill 212.\nMy family relies on safe biking infrastructure to get around Toronto.  We do not own a car and we rely exclusively on transit, walking, and biking (for the record I don't own a bike, but I use bikeshare regularly).\nBill 212 will make life more dangerous for my 3 year old, and, unsurprisingly, I take the premier's actions here personally.  I know many other families that are feeling the same way.\nMy family lives near - and uses - the Bloor protected bike lane regularly. I walk along Bloor daily and know that pedestrians benefit from safety infrastructure too.\nIf you want to make Toronto a place that is welcoming for young, tax paying families like mine, what is happening with this bill is absolute poison. If you insist on making the streets our children use more dangerous, we will not be quiet about it.\nYou must reverse course of Bill 212.\n"

        "comment": "As both a driver and cyclist, I am concerned with the proposed approach to dealing with local transportation options presented in this bill.\nWhen I drive, I want cyclists to be out of my way. When I cycle, I want to be protected from drivers. Separated bike lanes accomplish both of these goals, while still making it possible for cyclists to access the places they need to be. Moving bike lanes to secondary streets often makes them impractical for cycling.\nAdditionally, I am concerned with the province limiting the options of municipalities for managing transportation. I live in a small town of under 15,000 people, and I realize that the provincial government cannot have local knowledge of how a bike lane can hurt or help my town. Likewise, I believe other cities also have more information about which transportation options will work best for them.\nAdditionally, I have concerns about the other contents of the bill, including the changes to environmental assessments and property ownership rights.\nWith all of this in mind, I am strongly opposed to this bill.\n"

Bike lanes are part of a growing city, but these were not well thought out, they were a poor use of taxpayer money at a time that the city does not seem to have enough and they have impacted the community in a negative way, while being infrequently used.\n"

The bike lane installation and removal of a car lane on Bloor St West in Etobicoke has caused significant disruptions to my community.\nBusinesses are apparently suffering. The increase in traffic congestion is unacceptable. I dread driving to High Park or the Runnymede Library with my grandkids because of the backup at the Humber bridge and South Kingsway. Parking a car on Bloor St is no longer safe and parking spots have been significantly reduced.\nThe bike lanes should be removed from Bloor and installed on roads that will not have such negative impacts on residents.\n"
