        "comment": "I strongly support the removal of bicycle Lanes on major arteries that are causing traffic congestion. Back in the '70s, the city of Toronto started a program of developing bicycle routes running parallel to major arteries on secondary roads that did not impact traffic flow. I used to use the bicycle route from Lawrence Avenue West near Avenue road which followed the path of Avenue road but approximately one block east. It was a much more enjoyable ride and a much safer ride for cyclists including myself, than riding down Avenue road.\nI often visit the Yorkville neighborhood and the bicycle lane on Davenport has created a huge amount of traffic congestion. This traffic condition has resulted in increased pollution. The bicycle Lane itself is seldom used the last time. I sat for 20 minutes waiting to turn right at Davenport and Avenue road I saw exactly two cyclists (including one city of Toronto parking enforcement officer, so only one private citizen) using the bicycle lane but dozens and dozens of cars tied up in traffic.\nWhile riding a bicycle in Toronto during the summer months may be an enjoyable mode of transport, most of the year is too cold or wet for it to be a pleasant mode of transport. This makes comparison to other cities invalid for the most part. Distances are also much greater in Toronto than they are in European cities or even Manhattan. I have visited Manhattan many times and often will walk from one major intersection to another I know few people who actually walk from one major intersection i.e yonge and Bloor to another major intersection I.e Eglinton and yonge because the distances are too great in Toronto.\nI want to thank the Doug Ford government for bringing forward this common sense legislation.\n"

        "comment": "I'm deeply concerned about the province meddling in the affairs of cities and overriding local decisions to remove infrastructure, and about overriding environmental protections to force through a highway project. None of these things will solve congestion.\nPeople and things need to get places, not \"drivers\". People driving a car alone simply does not scale to meet the transit needs of a big city - it is not possible to build enough lanes of traffic to not have congestion, via the well established urban planing concept of induced demand.\nI own a car, but, I try to bike and walk and take public transit wherever those options are reasonably convenient and safe. The fewer car trips I take, the better for me (more exercise), the better for the planet, and better for road congestion for everyone who is driving and on public transit. It is simply not possible to build enough lanes of traffic to \"solve\" congestion, as investing in roads over other forms of transit just induces more people to drive places. And cars are incredibly expensive compared to a well funded transit system.\n"

The Act includes provisions respecting how such orders may be carried out and the expiry or renewal of orders.\u201d\n\u201c SCHEDULE 3\nHIGHWAY 413 ACT, 2024\nThe Schedule enacts the Highway 413 Act, 2024. Section 2 of the Act provides an exemption from the Environmental Assessment Act for enterprises, activities, proposals, plans and programs for or related to Highway 413, including the Highway 413 Project and the Highway 413 early works projects. Section 3 prohibits a person from carrying out the Highway 413 Project except in accordance with the final environmental impact assessment report and any addenda to it, prepared as part of the environmental impact assessment process that applies to the Highway 413 Project under this Act. Sections 4 to 9 set out that process, including requirements for an Indigenous consultation plan and its implementation, as well as opportunities for persons to comment on the draft environmental impact assessment report and any draft addendum to the report. The Minister is required to publish draft and final environmental impact assessment reports and any final addendum under the Act.\u201d\nSchedule 3 describes designing highway 413 without an environmental assessment, but requires \u201ca person\u201d to have the environmental assessment prior to carrying out the project. This means the project will be designed without environmental safeguards found in an environmental assessment.\nPlease review and stop this bill from moving forward. If this bill moves forward, there will be more bills excluding other projects from environmental protection.\n"

Greenspace is for all of us, particularly our wildlife, and shouldn't be turned into green (i.e., money) just to line the pockets of developers (whether housing or roads) in a show of blatant cronyism.\n"

It also is a complete overstep of the provincial government. Are there not more important things for this government to fix within its actual jurisdiction? Forcing people into cars or making them less comfortable to go out for unnecessary trips (most often for shopping) isn\u2019t the answer to congestion on the roads.\nThis will be a mistake future generations will despise if it goes through.\n"

        "comment": "Ontario's Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, which aims to improve transportation infrastructure and reduce traffic congestion, is a proposal that may sound promising on the surface, but upon closer examination, it reveals several flaws that could worsen the problem it seeks to address and ultimately lead to long-term negative consequences.\n1. Overemphasis on Expanding Road Infrastructure\nOne of the central components of the Act is the expansion of road networks and highways to alleviate gridlock. While this may seem like a direct solution to traffic problems, it fails to account for the well-established phenomenon of induced demand. This concept suggests that simply building more roads encourages more people to drive, which can actually increase congestion in the long run. Rather than reducing gridlock, expanding infrastructure often leads to even worse traffic as more vehicles take advantage of the newly constructed lanes, quickly filling them up. This cycle of endless road expansion is not a sustainable solution and could ultimately lead to a \u201cbigger is worse\u201d situation.\n2. Environmental Impact and Urban Sprawl\nThe Act\u2019s focus on road-building and expanding highways also overlooks the environmental consequences of such projects. More roads lead to greater carbon emissions, which is a direct contradiction to Ontario\u2019s climate goals. The construction and maintenance of highways require significant energy and materials, and increased car usage contributes to air pollution and worsens the province's carbon footprint. Additionally, expanding highways encourages urban sprawl, as more land is developed for new housing, businesses, and industries along major roadways. This sprawl can diminish green spaces, harm ecosystems, and increase the pressure on municipal services in new suburban areas.\n3. Neglecting Public Transit and Active Transportation\nThe Act\u2019s focus on roads and highways overlooks the crucial role of public transportation and active transportation (e.g., walking and cycling) in solving gridlock. For Ontario to truly reduce traffic congestion and improve quality of life, the government needs to prioritize investments in transit systems, such as buses, subways, and commuter trains. Expanding these systems would provide Ontarians with viable alternatives to driving, reducing the overall number of vehicles on the road. The Act should also place a stronger emphasis on creating safe cycling lanes and pedestrian pathways to encourage active modes of transport. By neglecting these areas, the government is not addressing the underlying need for sustainable transportation solutions.\n4. Lack of Focus on Congestion Pricing and Demand Management\nInstead of simply building more roads, Ontario should explore solutions that manage traffic demand. Measures like congestion pricing, which charges vehicles to enter high-traffic areas during peak hours, have proven effective in cities around the world, such as London and New York. The Act misses this opportunity to implement more sophisticated strategies to reduce congestion in a way that encourages people to take public transit or adjust their travel habits. Without addressing demand management, the province risks continuing to support a car-dependent culture, which exacerbates gridlock rather than alleviating it.\n5. Impact on Local Communities and Quality of Life\nThe expansion of highways and road networks under this Act could have detrimental effects on local communities. New roads often pass through residential neighborhoods, leading to increased noise, pollution, and the disruption of local businesses. These communities may find themselves trapped between expanding highways and deteriorating environmental conditions, ultimately reducing their quality of life. Additionally, road expansion can lead to displacement of existing residents, particularly in underprivileged areas, who may be forced to relocate due to construction projects or gentrification driven by increased access to transportation corridors.\n6. Missed Opportunity for Innovative Solutions\nInstead of continuing with outdated and car-centric solutions, the Ontario government should be looking for more innovative transportation alternatives. This could include increasing investment in shared mobility services like carpooling, ride-hailing, and autonomous vehicles. There is also potential to integrate smart traffic management systems that can reduce congestion by optimizing traffic flow. These technologies are not given enough attention in the Act, which suggests the government is still focused on old models of transportation infrastructure that may no longer be the most effective in addressing modern challenges.\nConclusion\nWhile the Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act proposes a solution to Ontario's traffic problems, its heavy reliance on expanding road infrastructure and neglect of alternative transportation options are shortsighted and ineffective in the long run. The government\u2019s focus on road construction is likely to exacerbate traffic congestion, contribute to environmental degradation, and encourage urban sprawl. To truly solve Ontario's gridlock issues, the government should prioritize sustainable transportation solutions, such as investing in public transit, improving active transportation infrastructure, and adopting congestion pricing and demand management strategies. Without these measures, the Act risks perpetuating the very problems it intends to resolve.\n"

By not creating cities that accommodate cyclists,  we are committing to a future of more cars and more gridlock. It\u2019s that simple. To see the potential of investing in a range of green transportation, we should be looking at cities like Amsterdam which are designed with cyclists and pedestrians in mind,  resulting in one of the safest cities to cycle, not to mention one of the most livable, with a lower carbon footprint than most cities of its size. Please do not make Ontario even more car-centric than it already is.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes create a safe space for cyclists to access the city. Not only do they keep the road organized and safer for cyclists, drivers and pedestrians, they promote clean, carbon free transportation. This is a growing necessity as the climate crisis continues to worsen. Cycling also promotes healthy living styles through physical activity, additionally providing positive support to people\u2019s mental health. Removing cycling lanes after the time spent with the public to install bike lane access, would be a step backwards for the government to take. It would be making the roads less safe for every user. Taking bike lanes away doesn\u2019t mean cyclists will stop biking, it means cycling will be more dangerous, for bike riders and drivers. Bike lanes keep everyone on the road safe, they should not be removed from our city streets.\n"

        "comment": "In 2024 while we are deep into a climate crisis and multiple public health crises including those related to obesity and mental health, we should be doing everything we can to encourage active transportation in all municipalities. We should be encouraging, rather than discouraging, people from cycling to their daily activities such as going to work, meeting friends, running errands etc. Bike lanes alleviate stress from our healthcare system as not only do they help keep cyclists safe and out of the hospital, but their presence encourages people that may not otherwise feel comfortable commuting via bicycle, to do so, thereby promoting physical fitness and lowering the risk of conditions like obesity and heart disease, while also contributing to positive mental health, and thereby resulting in less strain on our healthcare system as less people need to be treated.\nAs a cyclist in Toronto, there is a misconception that bikes lanes are not used. I use the bike lanes on Bloor-Danforth daily, and have been a year-round cyclist since Covid. Prior to the construction of the Ontario Line, I was also using the bike lanes on University Avenue multiple times a week, and have also benefited from the bike lanes on Yonge St, which was a street I dreaded cycling on prior (and still do dread cycling on the portions without bike lanes).\nAs a taxpayer, I am enraged that my funds are being wasted on an initiative that will put more Ontarians in the hospital - or even cause them to get killed - instead of being used to fix our healthcare and education systems. I am also enraged that the tax dollars used to install those lanes in the first place will now have been wasted. I do not approve of my money being used to remove bike lanes. I want my tax dollars to go toward hiring more doctors and nurses and paying nurses more. I want my tax dollars to go toward the backlog of repairs that need to be done in TDSB (and other school boards) schools. I want my tax dollars to go toward subsidizing post-secondary education for those that can't afford it. I want my tax dollars to go toward ending homelessness. It's time for the Government of Ontario to grow up and start addressing the real issues in this province.\n"
