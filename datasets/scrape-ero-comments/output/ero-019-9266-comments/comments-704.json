        "comment": "I wish to express my appreciation to this Government for soliciting my view as a Toronto resident, homeowner and bicycle commuter, on the sudden and unexpected intervention into the affairs of the City of Toronto by this same Government of the province, to slow and congest Toronto traffic yet further, and to bow to the  perceived special interests of a few automobile owners.\nI am a believer in the value of well managed urban cycling infrastructure in Toronto as an important way to make road travel safer, faster, healthier, and much less expensive for Toronto citizens. I have been a Toronto bicycle commuter since the early 1990's.\nCompared to driving, travelling by bicycle on the streets of Toronto is the way to travel for persons who know the value of their time( time not wasted in heavy traffic), the value of the physical and brain exercise that bicycling brings. And of course, in the dead of winter or the pouring rain, the TTC still offers a good alternative to riding, and a place to load the bike on a bus.\nBicycling in the 2020's is far easier, far safer, and often faster that it was in the 1990's. Cycling infrastructure improvements and development by our city have caused this difference.\nRemoving existing effective cycling infrastucture? A null option. A waste, to the benefit of no one.\n"

I was hit by a truck on a road where the bike lane was not installed at the time and I can't tell you how often I am worried for my safety with trucks and large vehicles either behind me or near me as I try to navigate the roads. I try to take any street that is safer or with bake lanes and it has made my cycling so much safer and enjoyable.\nPreviously Adelaide street was so dangerous to bike along as you had to watch not only for cars and potholes but also cars pulling over in front of you and people stepping out somewhat tipsy and not checking their surroundings. Now there is a dedicated bike lane and it is so much safer and easier to navigate.\nPlease don't take away the much needed bike lanes, it's not only a huge amount of money that won't help ease congestion but will only add to it as more people will either take cars or vehicles to avoid being hit on the road. Or worse more bikes will just ride on the narrow sidewalks.\nMy situation of being hit is not something I want anyone to ever experience. Please don't make a mistake that will hurt more riders.\n"

The law of induced demand that has been proven not only here in Ontario, but in countless other places around the world, states more lanes do not reduce traffic congestion in the long run. Putting more cars on the road WILL NOT REDUCE TRAFFIC CONGESTION.\nSpending billions of tax payer dollars on a new highway is widely irresponsible when even a portion of that budget could be put into new rapid public transportation or investing in the established public transit we already have(proven to actually be efficient at moving people from a2b given the proper design). Improve roads that we have already first and build new ones second. This is a blatant act of climate change denial- which will continue to pollute our smog infested city centres.\nOntario needs designers dedicated to sustainability, efficiency, and progressive design. The last 60+ years of the same thought pattern HAS NOT WORKED AS WE ARE NOW OBSERVING WITH HOW MUCH TRAFFIC CONGESTION THERE IS.\nMore roads, wider roads, and less delegation to alternative transportation options will directly hinder the livability in Toronto and should be disapproved ferociously .\n"

This is a conservative ploy designed to distract from their failed policies and has nothing to do with bike lanes.\nAlternate forms of transportation are the reality Toronto will need to move forward in a sustainable and liveable way. There simply isn't enough space to park cars, or on the roads.\nI live in Bloor West Village and routinely use the Bloor bike lanes to commute to and from work st Yonge and St. Clair. Bike lanes create safe, vibrant, economically viable communities. I am also a driver and like having bikes separated. It makes me feel safer when driving. If I am on my bike, I also love bike lanes. They improve my commute to work and provide a safe, healthy and fun way for my family to get around the city.  Without bike lanes, we would be one more car adding to the congestion.\nScrap Bill 212 and preserve municipal jurisdiction.\n"

        "comment": "This bill appears to conflate highways with city streets and avenues, including residential streets. We're not building condo complexes along Ontario's major highways, but people really do live on Bloor/Yonge/University. Those of us who live and work along these roads should have more say on how they are configured than commuters passing through.\nIt's unrealistic to expect that rush hour congestion would improve by trading a bike lane for a car lane - if anything, it will be worsened by cyclists and e-bikes/scooters taking up space in the car lanes and increased lane closures from accidents. Downtown isn't set up like the suburbs and why should it aim to become more like a suburb? Reduce gridlock within cities by improving transit and options that decrease the overall number of cars on the road.\nAlternatives to driving will expand people's options for how to get around, in particular people who can't drive (too young, medical conditions or disabilities, can't afford it). Freedom to travel easily shouldn't be limited to people with cars or who can privately pay for a rental or a driver. If the province is ready to spend money inside Toronto, increase funding to WheelTrans instead - Saving Disabled People's Time. Or just finish the Eglinton Crosstown already.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my deep concern over the proposed legislation outlined in ERO number 019-9266, which seeks to remove existing bike lanes and impose stricter controls on the implementation of new ones. As a resident of Toronto and a professional in transit planning, I believe this initiative poses significant risks to public safety and urban mobility.\nImpact on Cyclist Safety\nBike lanes are essential for protecting cyclists from vehicular traffic. Their removal would force cyclists to share lanes with motor vehicles, increasing the likelihood of accidents and injuries. Data from Toronto Metropolitan University indicates that the installation of fully separated bike lanes between 2000 and 2016 led to a 35% reduction in collision rates in surrounding areas.\nEnvironmental and Health Considerations\nEncouraging cycling contributes to reduced greenhouse gas emissions and promotes public health through increased physical activity. Eliminating bike lanes could discourage cycling, leading to higher vehicle emissions and associated health issues. This move would also hinder Toronto\u2019s efforts to achieve its TransformTO strategy target of net-zero emissions by 2040.\nEconomic Implications\nThe proposed removal of bike lanes is estimated to cost at least $48 million, including the loss of the $27 million already invested in their installation. Additional expenses would arise from redesigning and reconstructing roads to accommodate increased motor vehicle traffic. \ufffc\nTraffic Congestion\nContrary to the goal of reducing gridlock, removing bike lanes may exacerbate traffic congestion. During the construction required to remove these lanes, increased travel times for drivers due to traffic congestion from additional construction would be necessary to facilitate the removal of existing bike lanes. \ufffc\nPublic Consultation and Local Governance\nThe proposed legislation undermines local governance by imposing provincial control over municipal infrastructure decisions. Toronto City Council has formally opposed this plan, emphasizing the importance of respecting municipal autonomy and the extensive public consultations that informed the original implementation of these bike lanes.\nIn conclusion, the removal of bike lanes presents significant dangers to public safety, environmental sustainability, and urban mobility. I urge the provincial government to reconsider this legislation and engage in meaningful dialogue with municipal authorities and the public to develop transportation policies that prioritize safety, environmental health, and efficient urban mobility.\nSincerely,\nA concerned citizen.\n"

        "comment": "I am extremely concerned about the implications of this bill and am strongly opposed to its passing. As a student who doesn't own a car, bike lanes are hugely important to enabling me to get around and crucially, giving me options to get around. I have no plans to get a car, in part because the cost would be prohibitive, and prioritizing car infrastructure leaves those who prefer or crucially cannot afford to drive behind. Gridlock is a significant issue in Ontario, but the solution to it should be to give Ontarians more options to get around, not less. By making walking, cycling, and transit more viable options to get around (which the province is already doing in terms of transit), more people will try other options and gridlock will be relieved. By reducing the number of options people have to get around, gridlock will only worsen, and increased car traffic will have hugely negative impacts on the environment. Extensive research and international examples (such as Amsterdam) shows that bike infrastructure is a hugely beneficial way for residents to get around and to reduce car traffic.\nBy interfering in the planning of bike lanes, which have traditionally been municipal jurisdiction, introducing barriers to their installation, and potentially removing existing ones, the province is taking municipalities' ability to decide what's best for their jurisdiction away in this respect. When transport policies like bike lanes are involved, cities should be given some decisionmaking power over what's best for them, given that they are more knowledgeable about the unique issues in their jurisdiction. Interfering in bike lane planning only introduces more red tape that makes it harder for municipalities to implement their transit policies.\nAdditionally, the removal of existing bike lanes, especially those with permanent infrastructure, is a waste of the millions of dollars that were spent to install them, and the millions of dollars needed to remove them, just months after many were installed or upgraded. A City of Toronto report currently in the news estimates that removing just the lanes on Bloor, University, and Yonge, would cost nearly $50 million. That $50 million could easily be spent elsewhere, like initiatives to make cycling more practical or even measures to relieve car traffic with the infrastructure that's there now. Bike infrastructure is there for a reason and is not introduced without the careful planning of dozens, if not hundreds of city staff and planners. Using taxpayer money to undo much of that work is wasteful and sets a dangerous precedent for provincial interference in local issues. This doesn't even consider the dangers associated with a lack of bike infrastructure, and the fact that several cyclists have already died in accidents on Toronto roads in 2024 alone.\nOverall, this proposal to limit municipalities' ability to plan their own bike infrastructure and remove existing infrastructure is wasteful, counterintuitive to its objective, and potentially deadly if bikes are not properly accommodated on our roads. I know I'm not alone in this opinion, and I strongly urge the province to reconsider this highly dangerous proposal.\n"
