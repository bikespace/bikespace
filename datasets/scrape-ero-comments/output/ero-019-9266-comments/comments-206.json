Firstly, taking away the hard work that just went into implementing all of the bike lanes that made our streets safer over the past few years. Secondly, thousands of people rely on these bike lanes for their safety everyday. As someone who uses these lanes everyday, it has made commuting much safer and efficient. Please rethink this decision, it\u2019s literal lives at stake. Thank you.\n"

They are making it much more difficult for emergency vehicles to access the residential streets that only have access via Yonge. They are causing more environmental harm due the the congestion.\n"

Taking out bike lanes and putting bikes back into vehicle lanes isn't going to solve that problem, and may induce even more car traffic as riding a bike becomes more dangerous.\n"

This proposal goes against all of the academic literature and research on traffic congestion, and is not grounded in any verifiable evidence, qualitative or quantitative, whatsoever.\nThe overwhelming consensus amongst urban planners, urbanists and urban policy makers is that bike lanes not only constitute an effective, carbon-free form of transportation, but also make streets safer for vulnerable populations such as young children, disabled persons and senior citizens. I believe I speak for the academic community when I say Bill 212 is a disaster for Toronto's transportation network.\n"

        "comment": "This bill directly compromises the safety of cyclists in urban area and is also ingrained in a deep misunderstanding of what actually causes traffic congestion.  The real cause of congestion are vehicles on the road and construction, plain and simple.  Less cars on the road mean less traffic.  How can that be accomplished? By providing alternative forms of transport throughout the city that are convenient and safe.\nAs a driver and cyclist and lifelong resident in Toronto, I know for a fact that bike lanes take would-be drivers off the roads because I am one of them, alongside many others.  Many health care works rely on the newly constructed bike lanes on University Avenue (which is an exemplary look at how proper bike lanes should be).  Doug Ford's proposition to remove this specific bike lane is an absolute waste of millions of tax payer dollars, creates unnecessary red tap, and will ironically gridlock the streets with all the construction.\n"

        "comment": "Re ERO 019-9266\nI support legislation that would prohibit the installation of bike lanes when lanes for motor vehicles are removed as a result.\nI travel along Bloor Street daily. Very few bicycles travel along this route during the day while motorists use Bloor Street to get to and from work, shopping, schools and personal appointments. The majority of residents\u2019 means of transportation is by car or bus. There is gridlock along the stretch of Bloor where it has been reduced to one lane of traffic in either way in Toronto. What normally would take me a 15 minute drive typically now takes 40 minutes and I see very few bicycles along the way. The reduction to a single lane has caused significant congestion and has been a source of constant frustration for motorists.\nFurthermore Bloor Street is frequently used by the Emergency vehicles to access the residential streets south and north of it. Reducing lanes of traffic would make it dangerous and difficult for emergency vehicles to use Bloor Street. In addition I have witnessed motorists dangerously using the turning lane to pass vehicles in order to get to get ahead of traffic. In my opinion there has been an increased safety issue for cyclists, drivers, pedestrians and residents alike.\nRecently a motion was passed to reduce traffic lanes to one lane each way in the Applewood neighbourhood of Ward 3 in Mississauga. The new bike lanes are part of the Bloor Street Integrated Road Project, which will reduce Bloor Street from four lanes to two lanes for motorized traffic. The plans also include a continuous two-way left turn lane, widened sidewalks on both sides of the road, in-boulevard cycle tracks and trees on both sides of the road. There was insufficient disclosure of data supporting this change, an absence of bike usage data and inadequate consultation with residents in the area. Unwillingness to share data from studies leads me to suspect a thorough study was not done.\nThe Councillor in Ward 3 has downplayed the overwhelming protest made by Applewood residents that do not want bike lanes and are not in favour of lane reductions on Bloor Street. A petition was signed by more than 3,300 Applewood residents opposing traffic lane reductions. The councillor said that bike lanes resulting in traffic lane reduction is what residents want, yet she is unwilling and unable to produce data and studies support this when asked. During a meeting at Mississauga city hall that I attended, the councillor actually cited a meeting with a handful of parents at a local elementary school expressing concerns over their children\u2019s safety when they ride bicycles as her only anecdotal support for bike lanes at the expense of the reduction of traffic lanes.\nI agree with the over 3,300 Applewood residents that have signed the petition and do not want bike lanes at the expense of traffic lane reductions on Bloor Street. It's crucial for Bloor Street to maintain two lanes of traffic in each direction to accommodate the heavy vehicular flow, avoid prolonged travel times, and prevent a heightened risk of accidents.  When designing infrastructure, it's essential that it reflects the needs and usage patterns of the community. It is imperative that there is a reassessment of bike lanes and traffic lane reduction on Bloor Street, considering the concerns about data accuracy and the broader implications for the community. Please stop the plan to reduce traffic lanes along Bloor Street in Mississauga.\nI thank you for this opportunity to share the concerns of my neighbours in Ward 3.\n"

        "comment": "Toronto is behind many cities in the world (really world-class ones like Paris and New York) in terms of cycling infrastructure. It boggles my mind that the provincial government is actually working against the wishes of the citizens of their own cities who have worked tirelessly to improve cycling in the cities they live in. Because of these improvements in cycling, I am less worried when my teenage sons and I travels around downtown Toronto by bicycle to get to work or school.\nRoads should be for all citizens who pay taxes, not just ones who drive cars, and making them safer by providing protected bike lanes is a no-brainer. We're not going to solve congestion by giving more space back to car drivers - at 6 square metres per vehicle, it's simply not tenable. Improve transit, and provide MORE safe options for people to get around, not less.\nFurther, directing bicycles to side streets is not a solution - often car drivers leave less space when passing on such routes because these roads are narrower.\nAnd to spend my tax dollars ripping out existing bike infrastructure is incredibly fiscally irresponsible.\nMy safety and my son's safety is worth more than a few minutes extra travel time for car drivers.\n"

They cause traffic jams that cannot be good for the environment in terms of  thousands of cars idling in jammed traffic congestion emitting carbon pollution. These bike lanes also block essential services like fire trucks, ambulance from circulating and getting to the needed people on time to save their life. Plus the bike lanes cause accidental hazards to pedestrians trying to cross those streets from these e-bike circulating at high speed.\n"

        "comment": "I\u2019m deeply disappointed with the recent proposal to rip out major bike lanes in Toronto. This decision is not only misguided but a complete waste of taxpayer money and a step backwards in fostering a healthier, safer, and more vibrant city.\nThe claim that bike lanes cause traffic congestion is demonstrably false. Bike lanes actually REDUCE congestion by giving people alternatives to driving, taking would-be drivers and passengers out of the road and putting them into a bike lane. The math is simple; fewer cars on the road means less gridlock. Studies have repeatedly shown that bike lanes help ease traffic, not exacerbate it.\nBike lanes are also good for the local, small businesses that you claim repeatedly to support. Bike lanes mean more pedestrian-friendly roads, and when people walk or bike, they are more likely to shop locally. This isn\u2019t just speculation; there is data from cities around the world including our own, showing how businesses along bike-friendly streets experience more foot traffic and higher sales. By removing these lanes, the Provincial Government is not just inconveniencing cyclists, it will hurt our local economy.\nEconomics aside, bike lanes save lives. Cities with robust cycling infrastructure consistently report fewer injuries and fatalities among both cyclists and drivers. These lanes provide a safe, dedicated space for bikers, reducing the risk of dangerous interactions with vehicles.\nIt\u2019s disturbing to think that after investing taxpayer money in creating a more forward-thinking, livable city, the plan is now to throw all of that away. This is a waste of public resources and sets a terrible precedent. We should be building on this progress, not tearing it down.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to the province's proposed plan to limit the construction of bike lanes in municipalities across Ontario. This decision is not just shortsighted; it undermines the very foundations of effective urban planning and the pressing need for sustainable transportation solutions.\nEvidence consistently demonstrates that bike lanes contribute significantly to reducing gridlock and greenhouse gas emissions while enhancing overall traffic flow. In a time when many residents are grappling with the rising cost of living, bike lanes are vital for those who rely on affordable transportation options, including delivery drivers and individuals without access to vehicles. Limiting this infrastructure would not only ignore the needs of these residents but also exacerbate existing inequalities in transportation access.\nTraffic congestion is a self-perpetuating problem; more cars lead to more gridlock. Expanding bike lanes offers a viable solution by encouraging alternative modes of transport and alleviating congestion. This is essential for the health and safety of our communities, as well as for combating climate change. The failure to invest in safe and accessible cycling infrastructure demonstrates a lack of vision and leadership in addressing urban challenges.\nClaims that bike lanes hinder emergency response are unfounded. The City of Toronto has stated that emergency services are fully capable of navigating existing cycling infrastructure, debunking the notion that bike lanes contribute to delays. In contrast, restricting bike lanes will directly endanger lives, particularly vulnerable road users, and impede the transformative projects outlined in Toronto's approved plan to add 100 kilometres of bike lanes over the next three years.\nWe need a government that prioritizes evidence-based decision-making rather than succumbing to political pressures that distract from the real issues at hand. The proposed legislation risks not only the progress made in Toronto but also undermines efforts across the province to create affordable and accessible cities.\nI urge you to reconsider this plan and stand for a vision of a city that embraces sustainable transportation options, prioritizing the well-being of its residents and the environment.\n"

Additionally this oversteps the autonomy of municipalities in a revenge filled vendetta against Toronto which doesn\u2019t even support research on traffic. More people on bikes means fewer people in cars.\nOn top of that, there are already plenty of incomplete provincial solutions to traffic, so removing access is pointless and painful.\nRemoving environmental assessments could increase flooding and it spits in the face of indigenous communities by further removing their history.\nDo not do this.\n"

A government that has induced more traffic and failed to manage public transit projects now wants to scapegoat bike lanes, accusing them of causing the congestion that is in fact caused by cars and trucks.\nBefore 1971, we didn't have a Ministry of Transportation - we had a Ministry of Highways. This legislation threatens to drag up back fifty years. What's next, the Spadina Expressway? Professional public servants, policy experts, and anyone who has studied transportation policy in urban areas understands that tearing up bike lanes and banning them from major streets is counter to housing, planning, transportation, emissions, and environmental goals. This action is reminiscent of when the Ford government, in its first term, ripped out EV charging stations, only to replace them later, at higher cost. The contempt for taxpayers, as well as the lives of cyclists, pedestrians, and other road users who benefit from safe infrastructure is breathtaking.\nThis abhorrent legislation will cost lives while failing to improve congestion. Championing it is shameful, and inconsistent with the values of public service.\n"
