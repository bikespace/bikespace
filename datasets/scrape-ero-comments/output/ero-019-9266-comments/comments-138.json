        "comment": "Bike lanes should not be a provincial matter. Municipalities understand the needs of their residents and need the freedom to plan their infrastructure as needed. International research has shown how bike lanes keep drivers, pedestrians, cyclists safer. They also ease gridlock by encouraging people to commute by bike, removing cars from the road. In addition, the sections of this bill reducing environmental assessments and protections when planning new roads and highways is unconscionable. We need to be protecting the environment.\n"

Traffic should be slowed, we should not prioritize cars in an urban centre, if you want car priority you have the choice to move to the suburbs. Stop telling Toronto what is best for our streets.\n"

        "comment": "My friend Alex Amaro died nearly 4 years ago because she was cycling on a busy Toronto street that did not have bike lanes where cars are permitted to go way too fast. She was not yet 25.\nThe fact that the country\u2019s largest city is being threatened with this barbaric, conservative, embarrassing legislation is frankly horrifying and this city will not stand for it. Doug ford, just because Toronto doesn\u2019t like you, it doesn\u2019t mean you get to punish us. Bike travel is part of the FUTURE and being so hideously uneducated about bike lanes is not acceptable in 2024. Please help prevent more deaths like my friend Alex\u2019s. There are ways for car travel and bikes to coexist peacefully and this bill will do nothing but jeopardize young lives and make more Torontonians die by cars. Please, please do not do this. Bikes are an integral form of this city\u2019s transportation network and cyclists deserve protection. Bike lanes can be an incredible asset to the city\u2019s infrastructure that help save lives and encourage the safe and environmentally sustainable form of transportation that is riding your bike. Ripping them up, and giving the conservative provincial government the last say as to their implementation will cause more deaths to cyclists, cause more pain for the families whose loved ones will die, and make our city less friendly, affordable, and sustainable. Please, please do not do this.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my support for the installation and expansion of bike lanes as part of Ontario\u2019s transportation planning. While I understand the desire to improve highway infrastructure and alleviate traffic congestion, I believe that promoting safe and accessible cycling routes through a dedicated bike lane framework is equally important for the future of our province.\nBike lanes contribute to reducing gridlock, improving air quality, and fostering healthier communities. Encouraging cycling as a viable mode of transport helps alleviate road congestion by offering an alternative to car use, especially in urban areas where roadways are often overcrowded. The environmental and public health benefits that bike lanes bring, from reducing emissions to promoting active lifestyles, should not be overlooked in our planning for future infrastructure.\nI firmly believe that a focus on better public transit and alternatives to driving is the only way to reduce traffic. It is the only logical choice and will result in a better future for our families.\n"

        "comment": "This seems to be lacking the consultation process with key stakeholders, mainly bike riders and emergency service drivers.\nBike riders are a sizeable portion of the commuter class in Ontario\u2019s largest cities\u2014 control over bike lanes should remain in the city\u2019s jurisdiction to ensure that users of this critical infrastructure are heard.\nI don\u2019t even ride a bike, I am primarily a pedestrian and a driver myself, and I feel safer as a driver with dedicated bike lanes to ensure that everyone is safe. Issues of emergency vehicle access has historically been more linked to improper and illegal parking as well as vehicle congestion instead of bike riders that take up at least 60% less of the road than a vehicle and are capable of maneuvering around obstacles much quicker than a vehicle. As the bike rally on October 23rd in Toronto demonstrates, even large groups of cyclists are capable of quickly pulling over and allowing emergency service vehicles through\u2014 I would argue much faster than the same amount of people in a car.\nAdditionally, Toronto, where I live, continues to lack the frequency and access to quickly access different areas of the city, either through public transit or driving. Cycling continues to be the fastest and safest option to get from one place to the next for many people, but removing dedicated bike lanes will further increase strain on public transit and road congestion that the city is already seeing.\nIt is quite clear that this is a politically motivated bill that has been created by a very small and vocal minority, supported by people who do not have any stake in this (ie. rural habitants and politicians).\nI will be beyond disappointed and frankly insulted if I see this Bill continue.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal fundamentally misunderstands the relationship between road infrastructure and traffic congestion.\nThe well-documented concept of 'induced demand' shows that adding car lanes typically increases traffic, while bike infrastructure helps reduce it. Cities like Copenhagen, Amsterdam, and Montreal have demonstrated that robust bike infrastructure reduces overall congestion by providing efficient alternatives to car travel.\nResearch consistently shows that bike lanes can actually improve traffic flow:\n- Protected bike lanes in New York City reduced travel times for all users\n- Studies in Toronto showed that the Richmond-Adelaide bike lanes improved car travel times despite removing a vehicle lane\n- The 'fundamental law of road congestion' (Duranton & Turner, 2011) demonstrates that adding road capacity for cars does not solve congestion long-term\"\nThe proposal overlooks the economic benefits of bike infrastructure:\n- Increased retail activity along bike lanes (studies show cyclists spend more at local businesses)\n- Reduced infrastructure maintenance costs compared to car-only roads\n- Health benefits and reduced healthcare costs from active transportation\n- Attraction of young professionals and businesses to bike-friendly cities\nWhile this proposal mentions environmental implications will be 'considered,' it fails to acknowledge that bike infrastructure is crucial for meeting Ontario's climate commitments, that active transportation reduces air pollution and associated health costs, and that bike lanes improve public safety for all road users, including drivers.\nRather than restricting municipal authority over bike infrastructure, the province should support municipalities in expanding both protected bike lanes and public transit, focus on proven congestion-reduction strategies like improved transit and complete streets, and help municipalities collect data on the positive impacts of existing bike infrastructure.\nThank you,\nConcerned Ontario Citizen\n"

        "comment": "Regarding schedule 4, this is an absolutely terrible idea that not only ignores established research and real-world precedent, but actively opposes them. This is the traffic equivalent of denying climate change.\nIt is disgusting that safety isn't even listed as a consideration here. That alone is a remarkable failing that should have been caught and addressed immediately upon the first draft. The fact that it wasn't only serves to assure us that this bill was not written to be in the public's interest. With no bike lane, cyclists either end up illegally on the sidewalk or they share lanes with cars, which increases danger of death or injury, frustrates drivers (leading to increased likelihood of incidents), taxes the mental health of cyclists, incentivizes some cyclists to switch to driving instead (which further increases congestion), and offers no benefit to make up for any of these.\nIn fact, the *only* consideration listed is whether a bike lane reduces the number of car lanes. For decades, we continue to see that the number of lanes cars can use is not a useful metric. The legislation doesn't even attempt to tackle reducing congestion, which is what it's supposedly meant to be doing given the bill's name.\nWe've always known how to reduce congestion: reduce the number of cars on the road. Cars are what cause congestion, not bicycles or any other inane excuse. Cars are the cause of every problem that ever comes up when it comes to roads. They kill and injure people, take up tons of space, put a lot of strain on roads, are vastly inefficient for moving people when not much flexibility is required, and are at the root of the mental strain caused by transportation.\nThis is an egregious overreach by the provincial government into the jurisdiction of municipalities, and a very stupid hill to die on. In addition, this is simply one part of a larger bill that should be multiple separate bills. The others involve more of the same lack of evidence.\nThe provincial government should be absolutely ashamed of having this bill mire them.\n"

I prefer cycling to driving, but I only cycle when I know that there are safe bike lanes all the way to my destination. I'm fortunate that this is the case between my home and office. Every day that I cycle to and from work, I am one less car on the road. If you want to reduce gridlock, give people like me more opportunities to safely cycle around my city.\n"

        "comment": "This bill flies in the face of masses of information to the contrary. Cities have a finite amount of space and it does not matter how many more traffic lanes are squeezed in, it will not fix congestion.\nPlease look at jurisdictions where multi-mode transportation has been done effectively, London England springs to mind as of course does the Netherlands and Scandinavia.\nParticularly relevant to Toronto, in London, a congestion charge was implemented at the same time as public transport was massively improved and increased. Bike lanes have been expanded. Almost overnight congestion was vastly reduced. Air quality has improved dramatically.\nDo not respond to the ludicrous \u201cdog whistle\u201d political machinations of a government that refuses to acknowledge established research and principles.\nContrary to what a lot of people say, car usage is greatly subsidised by the taxpayer. Bike lanes cost very little by contrast with vehicle infrastructure.\n"

        "comment": "Smart streets provide options for people to access and travel through them using all modes of transportation; pedestrian, cycling, and motorized. Properly designed bike lanes are an important feature in this design, keeping cyclists and pedestrians safe, while keeping traffic flowing for drivers.\nThe province should not be involved in dictating where cities can employ dedicated cycling infrastructure. Cities have staff incuding urban planners and consultantion specialists who know the city best and the needs of its occupants. The city staff are also invested in the success of small main-street bsuinesses, most of which are accessed on foot or by bike, not by car. To promote small business and thriving local communities, bike lines should be ecouraged, not politically penalized.\nThe crush of traffic experienced in cities like Toronto are not a result of bike lines. It is the result of poorly coordinated construction work (often by provincial partners, such as MetroLinx and MTO) and an unecessery return-to-office mandate, forcing more people to commute in private vehicles from outside of transit-serviced areas to downtown offices. By expanding commuter rail service, incentivizing public transit, and taking trucks off the 401, \"rush hour\" could be greatly reduced.\n"
