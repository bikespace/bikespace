        "comment": "I am happy to hear that the Province of Ontario is going to restrict and monitor where bike lanes can be placed.  For example, the City of Mississauga wants to remove one lane of traffic in each direction on Bloor Street to insert bike lanes.  This will reduce all of Bloor Street in Mississauga to just one lane in each direction.  It will be a nightmare - just like the Bloor Street nightmare in Toronto.  Most of the residents in the Applewood area of Mississauga are opposed to removing traffic lanes from Bloor Street because it is a major roadway, however, the new Mayor and the City Councillor for the area want the bike lanes built - even though thousands of neighbours in the area have petitioned against them.  We cannot fight city hall, but perhaps the Province can.  Thank you, Doug Ford, for using common sense and putting some restrictions on bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is completely unnecessary and dangerous for many reasons. Firstly, the Ford government boasts itself of cutting red tap, ensuring Ontario is open for business and making it easier to build homes and infrastructure that is needed. This bill does the opposite of all these supposed claims from the Ford government with this introduction of red tape at the Ministry of Transportation to review bike lane installations across Ontario. This is a completely ridiculous request that will result in less bike lanes being installed when a traffic lane is removed which is assumed to be the Ford's governments underlying strategy.\nThe second reason that this bill is unnecessary and dangerous is the universal knowledge that bike lanes do not slow down traffic. It is widely known that adding an additional car lane does not result in faster traffic flow but more traffic and therefore slower flow. The addition of bike lanes make it safer for cyclists and if people feel safe then more people cycle and thereby less cars on the road. If the Ford government was interested in reducing traffic congestion in Ontario, then they should be focussing on increasing cycling infrastructure to encourage people to ride their bikes instead of driving. The Ford government should also be investing heavily into public transportation to encourage again, more people to take public transport rather than drive. Further, the Ford government should be investigating more intense urban planning options such as fourplexes and other alternative housing options to provide people with options to live closer to work rather than long commutes to affordable housing. Another idea suggested to reduce traffic congestion seen in the GTA is to provide trucks with free 407 use. The 407 sits empty whereas the 401 is super congested - move the trucks to the 407 to let more commuters through on the 401.\nI live in Guelph, Ontario and have cycled to work for years in all 4 seasons which is possible for most areas in Southern Ontario. Unless there is a large dumping of snow, it is easy to cycle all year round. We need to advocate for these alternative transportation methods rather than emphasize our infrastructure and our culture into car culture. Also Guelph has been advocating for years about two-way all day Go Train service to Toronto via the Kitchener line. The train is so convenient to get downtown which we would take frequently but there is no weekend or evening service...so it is only designed for commuters into Toronto. This is a great example of where time and effort of the Ford government could really make an impact to a huge population of Ontario - KW and Guelph. There infrastructure is in place but we need more service on the line.\nRemoving and/or restricting bike lanes in Ontario will not help with the traffic congestion. There are so many alternatives that should be explored to reduce traffic congestion such as increased bike lanes, better public transit options, moving the trucks to the 407, alternative housing options such as fourplexes. This government is looking for the answers in all the wrong places - the removal of bike lanes will not solve anything!\n"

        "comment": "I live in Mississauga near the proposed Bloor Street bike lanes. Our neighborhood has rallied together in strong opposition of these bike lanes. In this section of Bloor between Central Parkway and Etobicoke it is currently two lanes each way. It is a busy roadway with numerous homes, apartments, commercial plazas and schools. Right now the roadway moves well. Removing one bike lane each way will make this slow and full of traffic as we have seen happen east of it in Etobicoke where they\u2019ve already reduced for bike lanes. This makes no sense\u2014I drive this daily and don\u2019t see cyclist. The City of Mississauga held \u201cconsultations\u201d that were just for show\u2014they never really wanted our opinions. They came with presentations with options but it was clear they had an agenda of what they wanted to do. Our amazing neighborhood association came together and organized a petition, lawn signs and community meetings. Yellow signs dotted everyone\u2019s lawns in protest. The City ignored us all, more concerned with \u201cticking a box\u201d that they met their goal to addd bike lanes. Please put this bill forward and STOP the removal of car lanes for bike lanes. Most people cannot cycle to work or other errands. Thank you for your consideration and my thanks to Premier Ford for common sense ideas that actually work for the majority!\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are essential because they make biking safer and more accessible, helping both cyclists and drivers navigate roads more easily. By providing dedicated space for cyclists, bike lanes reduce the risk of collisions between bikes and cars, which is especially important in areas with busy traffic. They encourage more people to bike, which reduces car traffic, improves air quality, and promotes healthier lifestyles. Additionally, bike lanes support sustainable transportation by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on fossil fuels, making them a key part of building eco-friendly and livable communities.\nLastly, bike lanes give my husband and me quality, active time together, creating a safe, enjoyable way for us to explore our city. With dedicated bike lanes, we can ride without worrying as much about traffic, making it easier to experience different neighborhoods and sights while staying active together.\n"

Mississauga has 3 new apartment buildings/condos approved for the south east corner of Fieldgate and Bloor on the south side, and NOW there is a proposal being put forward to eliminate our local plaza and replace it with 3 more apartments/condos - 13 floors, 18 floors, and 22 floors on the north east corner.  And, they're wanting to eliminate a traffic lane on Bloor Street to put in bike lanes.  It's going to be a traffic jam beyond belief.\n"

        "comment": "Mississauga\nI wish to object to the proposed bike lane planned for Bloor street in Mississauga.  An alternative plan was put forth that would not take out a car lane but council would not approve.  If the bike lane goes through it would cause many problems for my neighbourhood.  Among these would be cars idling for long periods of time, loss of revenue to businesses, road rage/frustrated drivers.  One of my main concerns is delaying of emergency vehicles to homes on Bloor and roads that run off Bloor. Thank you\n"

The emphasis should be on adding bike lanes and public transit to reduce vehicle traffic.\n"

People that blessed us with wide roads and open spaces. All being torn up by incompetent fools. Thank you Premier Ford. The fact an option existed to put a bike lane on the Bloor boulevard without impacting traffic, which would have been beneficial and safer for cyclists speaks volumes.  It was never about bikes.  If you can now do something about these pathetic speed bumps that would be great.\n"

        "comment": "The government has the wrong priorities. Younger people who are future basis of our work force have embraced alternative transportation forms such as cycling and are now demanding that the roadways be made safer. That includes creating dedicated bike lanes. This is the direction that most forward thinking municipalities in Europe are taking and which the city of Toronto has embraced. The provincial government, it appears has other priorities. Bike lanes have had little impact to no impact on the flow of traffic. The traffic flow adjusts as drivers adapt their habits. Construction related closures are far more impactful on traffic flow. And in Europe where congestion has been a growing problem for decades, the bicycle is welcomed and cars are being excluded from city centres. It is my opinion that a municipality has the right to manage its own streets with a  policy that is consistent with the peoples desires and which is appropriate to the future requirements of a growing city. A government that believes otherwise is not a government I want in power.\nF.L.\nCity of Toronto\n"

Mississauga's attempt to reduce a busy 4 lane road (Bloor St.) to 2 lane with a shared left turn lane, while adding not 1, but 2 bike lanes, in a rapidly growing community would be VERY short sighted!!! This would also limit East West traffic and access from West side of Mississauga. Places around the country and the world are spending billions to INCREASE traffic flow, not the opposite.   Please intervene to modify the plan.  I'm definitely FOR bike lane where (if) possible, but NOT at the expense of car lanes.\n"
