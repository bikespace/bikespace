        "comment": "Bike lanes help reduce traffic by encouraging more people to take alternative modes of transportation that isn\u2019t a personal vehicle. Removing the lanes just increases safety risks to cyclists and does not promote a culture of alternative transit. Existing bike lanes should not be removed and should instead be expanded on. If we really want to reduce congestion, the best solution is to eliminate street parking on major artery roads and to encourage the use of public transit by keeping it safe and reliable.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are critical infrastructure necessary to allow Torontonians to commute daily without contributing to the car traffic jams. Removing bike lanes would put more cars on the same road, increasing congestion. Additional car lanes have repeatedly shown not to improve traffic times long term. The amount of space a cyclist and a bike lane takes up is drastically less than a car, resulting in higher throughput of people getting to places quicker and faster.\n"

Biking is also a great form of exercise, it's clearly Ford doesn't bike otherwise he would see how great it can be to get from one end of the city to the next while enjoying the sun and taking care of one's health.\n"

        "comment": "I use bike lanes in my city, Hamilton every day.  I use them to get to work, to bring my kid to and from school, to run errands, and to get around the city.  I use the bike lanes in Toronto several times a month to visit family, shop, go to events, and get around the city.  Bike lanes allow me to do all these things safely and easily.  My partner is not an experienced cyclist, and bike lanes allow her to get around the city safely and comfortably.  When my kid is a few years older and riding his own bike, I hope that we can bike together - I wouldn't feel comfortable doing that without bike lanes.\nI am an experienced cyclist and I know that I would be able to ride anywhere, but I wouldn't feel as safe without a network of bike lanes throughout the city.  People who are less experienced and less confident definitely won't feel safe riding without bike lanes.  Bike lanes and routes on secondary streets are great for some trips, but they don't go to the places that most people want to go, and they make commuting and errands take longer.  I don't think it's better for anyone if I drive a car instead - more cars on the streets will create more traffic.  The only way to reduce traffic is to give people other options for getting around - and that includes a connected network of safe lanes for riding bikes.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 is incredibly shortsighted and would be a huge step backwards for the province of Ontario on the global stage.\nProfessional civil engineers and urban planners have long understood that bicycle lanes are significantly more efficient at moving commuters than car lanes are. This bill discourages efficient commuting - which is hypocritically the exact opposite outcome from its stated goal.\nFurther to this point, Ontario does not need highway 413. As repeatedly proven by both traffic planning studies worldwide and the provincial study specifically about highway 413, adding more traffic lanes does NOT ease congestion and demand will only increase. The result of more lanes is more traffic. Ontarians do not need more traffic, we need better and more efficient transportation options such as expanded train networks, dependable rapid bus lines, and a widely connected cycling network.\nThe most deeply distressing component of Bill 212 is the removal of environmental protection checks and balances for new projects. Ontario fertile farmland and biodiverse wetlands are finite and precious. Multiple previous governments have made significant efforts to protect this land for good reason. Removing the thorough environmental review process for infrastructure development will lead to permanent and unnecessary damage of some our most valuable land and ecosystems.\nI do not support Bill 212. I urge our decision makers to consult further with registered civil engineering, urban planning, and environmental engineering professionals prior to approving any of the bill's contents.\n"

        "comment": "This is a ridiculous idea. Bike lanes are not why there is traffic. Anyone who is on a bike is not in a car - if you want less traffic, you need less cars on the roads. Improving public transit, the bicycle network, and the pedestrian experience is the only way to have any hope of reducing traffic long term. If these things are not available, more people will take cars. More cars is more traffic; we cannot fix traffic by expanding the road width forever - we must give people options that are safe an reliable outside of an automobile.\n(Further it is a wild overstep to take this matter out of the hands of municipalities. Cities should be able to make decisions for there own locality)\n"

Data which shows overall benefits that go along with bike lanes, time and time again.\nLack of cycling infrastructure kills people, and no city lacks motor vehicle infrastructure. Back off and let the cities build their roads to benefit and keep safe *all* their citizens. Perhaps you should refocus your efforts and invest in public transit infrastructure, which is much more efficient at moving people around than more traffic lanes or tunnels under highways.\n"

Having trucks in the left lane doesn't help with congestion! There are so many things this ministry could be doing, but you're using cyclists as scapegoats. This bill won't solve congestion, bikes will still use these roads, and without a specified lane, they will slow down traffic.\n"
