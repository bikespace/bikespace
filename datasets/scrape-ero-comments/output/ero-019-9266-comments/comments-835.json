        "comment": "Dear Decision-Makers in the Ontario Legislature,\nI am distressed regarding the implementation of Bill 212 whose principles are contrary to the promise to improve affordability and the cost of living of Ontarians. An evidence-based approach demonstrates that plans to remove several existing bike lanes and increase red tape in adding new ones will DECREASE AFFORDABILITY, INCREASE TRAFFIC and REDUCE ROAD SAFETY IN ONTARIO.\nMy opposition to this bill is specifically because it will:\n1) REDUCE AFFORDABILITY as travel costs are frequently the most impactful on individuals and families after shelter costs. Car ownership is the most expensive form of movement and negatively impacts those in lower income groups disproportionately. According to studies by Allen & Farber (2021) & Allen et. al. (2023), low-income populations in the GTA are facing increasing barriers and costs to daily travel and activity participation leading to a risk of social exclusion. Offering multiple modes of transit provides transportation equity and reduces transportation poverty.\n2) REDUCE ROAD SAFETY as all road users (pedestrians, cyclists, car users and public transit users) are safer when roads are fairly divided and dedicated sections are provided for different types of road users. In this way, cyclists do not drift into roadways meant for cars or pedestrians and vice versa leading to fewer accidents. An academic study by Rothman et al. (2021) conducted in Toronto, Mississauga and Brampton found that \"traffic injury is a leading and preventable cause of child death and disability, with child pedestrians and cyclists particularly vulnerable\".\n3) INCREASE CONGESTION/TRAFFIC as studies show that the only effective means of reducing traffic is to provide alternate modes of travel (CBC, 2024). The more individuals are forced into car use due to non-existent or unsafe cycling conditions, the more existing car users will see the increased traffic on their routes.\n4) REDUCE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING as transportation is one of the highest source of emissions in Canada. Domestic transport-related greenhouse gas emissions have increased by 15% over the past decade (2009 to 2018) (Transport Canada, 2020). The higher emissions generated by personal vehicles contribute to climate change adding to a slew of issues ranging from health (e.g. poor air quality impacts physical and mental health to infrastructure (flood damage in Toronto was ~1 billion to date in 2024). Providing access to alternate low-emissions transit modes such as cycling is imperative.\nThank you for your review of my feedback.\n"

        "comment": "Everyone is safer with the bike lanes in place. We need to continue to make accessible infrastructure for pedestrians, bikers, and also improve our public transit system. Let's not move in the opposite direction in favour of drivers only. Removing bike lanes is a costly mistake, and would be a very poor decision in future city planning.\n"

        "comment": "As a community advocate and urban planning Master\u2019s candidate, I highly urge the provincial government to withdraw the proposed amendments to \u00a7195.2 of the Highway Traffic Act and Schedules 2 and 3 of Bill 212 enacting the Build More Highways Faster Act and the Highway 413 Act. These regulations are environmentally, agriculturally and socially deleterious to our Greater Toronto Hamilton Area communities and substantially harm agricultural lands in Caledon, the Holland Marsh and in other areas of Peel Region and Simcoe and Wellington Counties as well as the welfare of farmers, an increasing contingent of which are racialized and harvest crops for their respective cultural communities.\nAdditionally, the spending of monies involved in these three actions contained in Bill 212 represent investments that will in fact constitute bad planning and negatively impact economic activity inside Toronto; in its surrounding cities as well as engender more air pollution and increase child and senior deaths from more people being displaced back into cars and away from bicycles. Transit users on buses whether TTC, MiWay, BT, DRT, YRT or GO will be negatively impacted by these possible traffic flows. The currently existing bicycle lanes on Yonge and Bloor Streets and University Avenue represent policies rooted in municipal autonomy and principles of democracy and participatory planning. This was also Toronto\u2019s solution to a struggle that cities all around the region have contemplated in creating places and communities where they could fit more business activity and people together into smaller places. All without requiring environmentally unsustainable automotive use or single-detached home construction that would eventually exhaust various non-renewable resources and detriment the entire world.\nWhile the province is free to exercise its power over municipalities, they being its \u201ccreatures\u201d, doing so will cost at least $48 million from City of Toronto estimates. These funds could be invested in other initiatives to aid traffic flows, including cars, or that could more greatly benefit Ontarians.\nThe $48 million could be used to: create a fund to purchase affordable housing units and complexes at risk of private market acquisition; improve health care for Ontarians; fund labor and material costs needed to increase GO service system-wide, including two-way all-day service on the Kitchener, Milton, Stouffville and Richmond Hill lines; build housing units through a public builder to help offset vacancy rates and land value increases tied to housing speculation in Ontario; increase the level of payments remitted through programs like Ontario Works or the Ontario Disability Support Program; the list could go on.\nMost critically, the province could mandate that municipalities substantially increase user fees for parking to reflect the true cost and negative sociopolitical and economic externalities associated with widespread automotive use in the GTA. This one action is empirically proven to heavily deter people from driving and to instead carpool, walk, take public transit and cycle. This one action would keep our elders and our children safe on sidewalks or on roads, greatly increase farebox revenues for our transit and of course reduce traffic without hemorrhaging taxpayer dollars on destroying existing public works.\n"

I live at Bloor and Manning and the amount of cyclists I see at all hours of the day gives me hope that we will have a push towards more walkable cities.\nWhat Doug Ford is doing with this bill, and other bills like this, is distracting the funds away from actual public necessities like healthcare and teachers, to push for his own real estate deals. Also using this bill to push through environmental protections to allow for another 400-series highway brings dread to my everyday existence. Use public funds on things that REALLY matter.\n"

Moreover, the proposal to remove existing bike lanes is a terrible idea in itself: not only would this project be a tremendous waste of taxpayer money and a blow against public health, but\u2014as any traffic engineer will tell you\u2014adding car lanes does *not* reduce traffic congestion as much as adding viable alternatives to driving.\n"

        "comment": "This notice failed to include a statistical basis to support its claims or help the public understand the predicted environmental impact. We know bike lanes generally reduce car usage and emissions. An outcome of bike lanes is reducing the number of cars on the road, by providing a safe alternative to driving, which goes against the purpose of the proposed framework, but is very good for the environment. One of the purposes of the proposed framework is to ensure bike lanes do not slow down cars. The notice doesn't explain if the value bike lanes bring to community will be considered. Bike lanes improve air quality and reduce noise pollution, making cycling more accessible which is an affordable way to get around, among other benefits. The notice also doesn't explain the impact that forcing bicycles to remain in lanes which cares are traveling will have on travel speed, much less public safety. The notice also doesn't say With the information I have available, this proposal has the potential for a very negative impact on environment and local communities, without any evidence to show it will even achieve its own goal. Do not move forward with this proposal.\n"

        "comment": "I oppose the premise and intention of Bill 212 - Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024 - Framework for bike lanes that require removal of a traffic lane for the following reasons:\n1.\tRemoving existing bike lanes puts human life at risk. Over the past decade in Toronto, there have been 28 cycling deaths and 380 seriously injured cyclists. Nearly 70% of these cycling incidents occurred on roads without safe cycling infrastructure as reported by The Guardian news site.\n2.\tRemoving bike lanes discourages cycling that displaces car/transit traffic for short commutes. More vehicle traffic will increase air pollution that is harmful to health (e.g., harmful smog/particulates from vehicle exhaust) and harmful to our climate (GHGs from internal combustion engines).\n3.\tRemoving existing bike lanes will create short-term disruptive construction noise, dust, and air pollution as diesel-fueled construction vehicles are needed to remove existing bike lane infrastructure. The removal of infrastructure will also increase landfill waste streams.\n4.\tRemoving duly approved bike lanes in Toronto is undemocratic and inappropriately creating costs for Toronto citizens. The current City Council has voted 21-4 to oppose this bill and 22-3 to oppose paying the costs of removal which are reported to be $48 million.\n5.\tBike lanes have been built on Bloor Street after almost two decades of study. City of Toronto decisions to install bike lanes are based on extensive data-based research to determine where they would achieve the following goals: supporting safe cycling, supporting the local economy, and minimizing additional traffic congestion. As published in recent newspapers, bike lanes are good for business, according to Bloor-Annex BIA chair Brian Burchell.\n6.\tThe Ontario Government\u2019s rationale for this bill is lacking. The government has said that only 1.2% of Toronto\u2019s residents are cyclists. However, this statistic is based on Statistics Canada\u2019s data for the Toronto CMA area, an much larger area than the downtown Toronto area bike lanes in question (e.g., Bloor St. / University Ave. bike lanes specifically mentioned by the government as in-scope of the proposal to remove bike lanes). Data for more geographically relevant areas show that 8.3% of residents in the University-Rosedale riding are actually cyclists. A 2019 Nanos survey showed that close to 70% of Toronto\u2019s residents either bike commute in good weather (44%) or bike for recreation/fitness (26%) \u2013 as reported by CBC News.\n7.\tThe Government of Ontario claims that commuting times will be reduced, but they have not provided any data-based evidence for these claims. At best, these claims are anecdotal in nature. Considering that these bike lanes were approved by local municipal governments, it would be fundamentally undemocratic for Ontario\u2019s government to overturn local democratic decisions based only on ideological beliefs.\n"

There is a fair amount of public consultation before lanes are built but no studies\n  are being done to propose their removal. Their proposed removal is based on no official city study\n  involving public consult and seems to have escalated to a bill that removes the decision making from\n  the people it affects.\n- municipal level would be best suited to make decisions based on research conducted locally. Could\n  the process involve revision and amendment study after the lanes are in use for a year or so based\n  on study and consult with involved people to amend parts that can be improved?\nRegarding 413\n- though Federal level had already approved some kind of combined reducing of assessments for this\n  project I'm in favour of Federal level requiring EA from provincial. Provincial gov't was found to have\n  inappropriately surpassed proper study and avenues regarding other land use issues with greenbelt\n  zoning and development.\n"

        "comment": "There are many environmental sustainability reasons to oppose the passing of Bill 212. Since the Ford government has shown very limited concern for the environment since assuming office it is not pertinent to mention them in this submission.\nThis comment will focus on the concerns and interests of vehicular drivers. Most informed individuals would not subscribe to a \u2018car centric\u2019 point of view when it comes to transportation issues but, even if this were the case, removing bike lanes would not make sense. Many bike riders in bike lanes displace single vehicle drivers. If they switched to cars (and this includes bikes used for deliveries) the streets and roads would be markedly more congested, even if new vehicular lanes were made possible by removing bike lanes (especially when induced demand is considered).\nWhat threat are bikes to drivers? In a collision between a bike and a car it is obvious the car and driver are at infinitesimal risk compared to the cyclist.\nThe government needs to reconsider this legislation and let municipalities make the appropriate decisions in regard to transportation planning and infrastructure.\n"

Congestion charge.\nWhile it is widely considered political suicide by politicians, it actually works in the places someone was brave enough to implement it.  New York hopefully shows us this again.\n2. Outlaw \"free delivery\" of goods, in Toronto at least.\nPeople find it too easy to order items and have them shipped individually when shipping is free, no incentive to consider batching items or picking up at a depot they might easily get to.  Amazon is the biggest problem but others feel they need to offer free shipping too, and we all know we pay the costs other ways anyway.  Too much traffic is these frequent small deliveries.\n3. Establish delivery/drop-off depots at many major transit hubs to support item 2.\n4. Enforce HOV rules and expand HOVs, and enforce them with stiff fines for abusers and patrols.\n"
