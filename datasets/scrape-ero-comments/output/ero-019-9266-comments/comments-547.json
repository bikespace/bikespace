        "comment": "I believe this proposal is shortsighted and lacks a solid, evidence-based approach. Traffic congestion has been a persistent issue in the GTA for over a decade, and so far, most solutions have been temporary fixes that don\u2019t address the core needs of residents. If this plan to remove bike lanes goes forward, it should only be considered a short-term measure, with a clear commitment to building a more sustainable public transit system. We need to prioritize reducing car traffic in and around the city, with a focus on a timely, robust public transit solution. Expanding space for cars only invites more cars and worsens congestion in the long run.\n"

Biking is a good way to exercise while also getting from one place to another without having to use a car (bikes being the more environmentally friendly way instead of cars which is an extra plus). It's one thing not building more lanes, but destroying existing ones? Please don't do that. There's research and studies that show how much biking improves not only people's health but also improve congestion.\n"

        "comment": "Taking away the rights and responsibilities of our local ELECTED representatives and giving them to unelected bureaucracy is totally against my wishes. I want someone who drives the LOCAL roads to be involved in the long term planning and execution of that plan. Yes, have the ministry of transportation do things like researching and publishing best practices to provide guidance. That is, help develop the best ways to improve traffic flow through things like turning lanes, timing of lights, pedestrian flow etc. But let the municipality choose the methods that are best suited for the local situation. Having a long term plan and gradually executing it is a good thing. Having an unelected office in a city far, far away making piecemeal decisions is a bad thing.\nSecond, I'm tired of cyclists and pedestrians being killed by inattentive and aggressive driving. We need to make it easier for non-car drivers to get around. Four lanes on city streets don't increase traffic flow that much compared to 2 lanes with appropriate turning lanes and well-planned intersections. They aren't worth making it harder for the rest of the people to get around.\nI say these things as a driver of more than 40 years. I appreciate the changes I've seen in Waterloo region on the road system for cars. I appreciate the changes I'm seeing in urban and rural areas for bikes and pedestrians. I don't want someone in Toronto making decisions that prevent those good things for cars, bikes and walkers.\n"

More options for transportation, and more green vehicles on the road are better than a stopgap solution that will save a paltry amount of time at the most. Before bike lanes, traffic was bumper to bumper. After bike lanes, they're bumper to bumper. This is only going to make things worse. Keep the bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "In an affordability and housing crisis, governments at all levels are rightly focused on building homes and cutting expenses for Ontarians.  This has led to the relaxation of parking requirements for new buildings, a step the gov't of Ontario has enacted, as well as many municipalities including the city of Toronto.\nTransit and walking are not sufficient to service these car-free residents.  They need safe infrastructure to take alternative wheeled transportation.  This includes bikes, and scooters.\nRipping out, delaying, and increasing the costs of non-car lanes is counter to the policies set forth by the Ontario government, in addition to being an encroachment into the domain of municipal governments.  It will make it more expensive for Ontarians to live by forcing them into cars, which are more expensive than they have ever been and depreciate in value, as they have always done.\nIf the government was serious about reducing gridlock they would focus on providing better regional transit.  I live 115km away from Toronto in Guelph, a city of about 140000 people and I can't even get a direct bus there on the weekend for a daytrip with my kids.  In fact, when I do go to Toronto, I take my bike on the Go train (on the weekdays when the trains run) to Bloor station, where I can make use of the Bloor St. bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "I am a cyclist in the east end of Toronto who bikes to work, to get groceries, to see friends - to do pretty much everything. I see how efficiently the bike lanes move people because the TTC doubles my commute. On my commute I see kids going to school every weekday by bike. By biking I save money (but I still pay taxes that contribute to the city), do not use any greenhouse gases, and contribute to the local economy (it's a lot easier to buy things on your way home on a bike than by TTC). This bill proposes wasting tax payer money in order to rip out infrastructure that was just installed. It proposes ripping out infrastructure that will put people like me, like those kids I see going to school, at risk. Where does the government think that the cyclists will go? Does it think we'll just disappear? Instead, we'll take the lane, and some of us will be killed by aggressive drivers who use their car as a weapon. Taking the lane will substantially slow down traffic. We should have vulnerable road users in their own lane of traffic, which usually moves far faster than lanes of cars. Gridlock is created by cars, by poor traffic enforcement and blocking the box, by constant standing in no standing zones, and by turning lanes - not by bikes.\n"

The people who use these bike lanes will have to drive on the road making them more likely to be killed by a vehicle. Less bike lanes means more car traffic, more car traffic means more deaths. If these bike lanes are removed and bike deaths increase it will fully be on the hands of the government. If we continue to finish and make new bike lanes more people will use them and traffic will decrease. This bill will only lead to more traffic congestion and deaths.\n"

        "comment": "It is unconscionable to reduce major thoroughfares like Yonge Street and University Avenue to one lane of vehicle traffic. This has caused unprecedented traffic congestion, extreme frustration, and discourages people from coming downtown. The Mayor has called on businesses to bring their employees back into the office and for citizens to support stores and restaurants to restore the vibrancy of downtown, which is still suffering post-Covid. Then she installs bike lanes that make it near impossible for vehicles to get downtown. There are myriad other reasons why bike lanes don\u2019t make sense in Toronto. They can\u2019t  be used for at least 4 months of the year due to weather. And recent statistics show there have been more accidents and injuries since bike lanes have been installed. I am strongly in favour of removing bike lanes on major thoroughfares.\n"

        "comment": "Hello,  This comment is about the bike lanes in the city of Toronto that are on the larger busier roads such as University, Bloor and Yonge.  My Husband and I live on Roxborough Street East just by the Rosedale subway station.  Since the Yonge Street bike lanes, between Davisville and Bloor were established and Yonge Street was cut from 4 to 2 lanes, we have seen nothing but congestion during the rush hour periods.  The street that we live on, which is 100% residential, often has cars backed up from Yonge Street to Mount Pleasant, idling while they , very slowly, attempt to merge onto a completely backed-up Yonge Street.  I have many comments to make about the folly of the bike lanes on major arteries of the City; however, I will keep these comments to addressing the environmental impact.   I believe that our residential street is now full of idling cars during rush hour periods, because cars are avoiding Yonge, traversing Mount Pleasant and then using Roxborough Street East to cut across to Yonge as Roxborough Street East is the last street that connects Mount Pleasant to Yonge before St. Clair as all other streets back onto the ravine and are thus dead-ends.  This also begs the question about how emergency vehicles reach those dead-end streets during rush hour, that are only accessible by Yonge Street.  Nevertheless, I DO NOT understand how reducing major arteries to cars, causing congestion and idling vehicles, improves the environment when in fact, it likely worsens it.  Why not put the bike lanes in the residential neighbourhoods, except for motorized bikes including E-Bikes, that should be on the major arteries within the flow of traffic?  I am not against bike lanes but I am against congestion and idling vehicles especially in residential neighbourhoods like my own.  Thank you\n"

        "comment": "I am opposed to this proposed Bill for the following reasons:\nReality of Geography\n\"The Toronto ravine system is a distinctive feature of the city's geography, consisting of a network of deep ravines, which forms a large urban forest that runs through most of Toronto. The ravine system is the largest in any city in the world,\" [Wikipedia]\nToronto is blessed to have many ravines to enjoy. However, ravines create natural barriers to the flow of all traffic, requiring bridges for transportation to cross (roads, rial and subway). For example, East-West travel crossing the Humber River must funnel over only three bridge corridors: Lakeshore/Queensway, Bloor Street, or Dundas. There are no alternatives. This essentially repeats at Mimico Creek, a kilometer or so further along. The result, of course, is that all traffic is forced on to these busy crossings.\nA similar situation occurs with the west end rail corridor from the Junction to Union Station. The only East-West routes across are at King, Queen, Dundas, Bloor and Dupont.\nIt has been suggested that cyclists should use secondary streets instead of main arterial roads. The fact is there are no East-West routes in the west end that cross these barriers without funneling onto the main arterials. We have no choice, there are no alternatives.\nConflicts with the Charter of Rights\n\"The Charter protects everyone against unreasonable laws that could lead to\u2026. harm their physical safety\u2026\u2026laws should not have a severe impact on people\u2019s rights to life,\u2026.or security of the person.\" [Government of Canada www.justice.gc.ca]\nThe Charter of Rights and Freedoms specifically protects Canadians from unreasonable laws that could lead to harm or threats to physical safety. It is indisputable that separated bike lanes provide better protection from vehicular traffic than shared lanes. Thus, it follows then that the removal of existing bike lanes to force cyclists to use roadways unprotected from vehicles would be a contravention of the Charter. Removal of existing bike lanes would constitute an unreasonable law.\nSubways\nIt must be pointed out that the routes in question, Bloor, Yonge and University also coincide with our subway system. We have invested tremendous amounts of taxpayer money in this system. We should be encouraging drivers to use this means of transportation instead of expecting free flowing vehicular traffic. Removing bike lanes to theoretically allow better flow of vehicles would act against this.\n"

If Doug Ford truly wants to keep traffic moving in large urban centres - rather than award what are no doubt lucrative contracts to dismantle bike lanes to his developer friends - he will reverse this decision.\nIt behooves governments to make evidence based decisions and the evidence clearly points to the usefulness of bike lanes in reducing traffic. Ripping out the bike lanes will be a costly endeavour that will not improve the lives of Ontarians.\n"
