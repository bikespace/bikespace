        "comment": "Please don't do this. Doug ford has my vote except if they proceed with this. It's incredibly short-sighted and incompetent to think that removing bike lanes or preventing new ones to be built will help with traffic. There are a lot of people that do not understand how induced demand works, those people don't usually live in Toronto, more voters thus this policy. This demonstrates Doug Ford is not interested in solving problems, but instead in buying votes.\nIt is well understood, globally, that the solution to car traffic is providing other modes of transport, bike lanes being one of the most effective ones. Removing them, or preventing them to be built will introduce more car traffic not less.\n"

Every cyclist is one less car causing gridlock. If you\u2019re serious about improving traffic, there should be more of a focus on cycling infrastructure and public transit. Not more lanes for Ubers or cars to illegally stop, causing more traffic.\n"

        "comment": "Removing existing critical bike lane infrastructure in Toronto would be detrimental to the city and a prime example of major provincial overreach. Biking infrastructure improves not only traffic, but community safety and health. Moreover, the cost of removing biking infrastructure is a waste of taxpayer dollars, especially where the city has most recently invested in it's installation. The province should use this funding to deliver on the outstanding transit infrastructure that is sorely needed. Transit development is essential to keep Toronto moving and catch up with other world class cities. Our public transit systems see far more usage than any other option and the province needs to make meaningful and timely investment in getting these projects back on track. Transit infrastructure and investments are woefully underrepresented in the current proposed act. Fund public transit and reduce the provincial overreach outlined in this proposal - that's how the province can create real change for Ontarians.\n"

        "comment": "RE: 019-9266, Bill 212.\nAs a Toronto resident, this proposal outrages me. The government proposes to spend more money and waste the funds the City of Toronto has invested to remove existing bike lanes. It would be a colossal waste of our tax dollars. Furthermore, the provincial government should not dictate street design to cities. It isn\u2019t their jurisdiction.\nIs it a coincidence that part of Bloor Street West, quite close to where Doug Ford lives, is part of this proposal? Nope. He is pandering to the small number of constituents who live in his riding. Terrible!\nMaybe our provincial government could show some transport leadership and get the Eglinton Crosstown completed.\nThank you.\n"

        "comment": "With data and research suggesting the opposite of this proposed plan, it would simply make cycling exponentially more unsafe. Perhaps focus should be placed on removing parking from main streets such as Danforth and St Clair before a plan which puts people\u2019s life at risk is proposed. The more bike lanes there are the more people feel like cycling is a viable option. Additionally the construction that would be required to remove existing bike lanes would certainly make congestion worse. I, and many people who live and work in downtown Toronto, think this is a terrible plan. The Ontario government should focus on their own responsibilities such as healthcare and housing instead of encroaching on municipal responsibilities; responsibilities that a municipal government is in a much better position to address.\n"

        "comment": "The proposal to remove existing bike lanes from Bloor, University and Yonge St is so short-sighted, foolish, and truly a waste of time and money - which apparently is par for the course with this government. As a Toronto resident and Tax-Payer, I am sick of Premier Ford punishing the people of Toronto for his personal, petty grievances.\nEvery study ever conducted about bike lanes and traffic congestion shows that bike lanes DO NOT cause traffic congestion. The only thing that causes traffic congestion is cars. We have known about the concept of induced demand for decades. Adding car lanes has never once improved traffic conditions. The only thing that will ease congestion is providing safe, reliable and desirable alternatives to driving.\nThe Bike Lanes that the premier has selfishly decided to remove offer just that - a safe, reliable and viable alternative to driving. By being located on major arterial roads, they offer people a way to get around the city safely and efficiently. I understand that the Premier cannot conceive of the fact that most of the people in the city who cycle are not doing it as a mere hobby - they are cycling to get to their jobs, to take their children to school, to run errands, and to visit friends and family.\nBy removing the bike lanes you are directly putting these people in harms way. The \"us vs them\" rhetoric that THIS GOVERNMENT has stoked between drivers and cyclists has put cyclists and other vulnerable road users directly in harms way. When you remove the bike lanes, cyclists end up in road lanes, where aggressive and angry drivers feel entitled to endanger the lives of cyclists BECAUSE of the framing of this issue by this government.\nLastly - and perhaps most simply - the issue of Bike Lanes is NOT a provincial matter. These decisions should be left up to the municipalities - THOSE are the people the city votes for to deal with things like this. Just because the Premier is still upset that he was not elected as mayor of Toronto a decade ago, doesn't give him the right to cosplay as mayor of Toronto whenever he feels like it.\nFocus on our crumbling (due to privatization and lack of funding) health care and education. Do your ACTUAL jobs and work for ALL of Ontario. The Premier and the Transportation should be ashamed of themselves. Keep the province OUT of municipal matters.\n"

        "comment": "Removing the bike lanes is an unnecessary cost which will the residents who bike in the impacted areas at higher risk. Additionally during the removal process it will create constructions delays. On top of that, adding more lanes does not decrease traffic or speed up the flow of traffic. This has been shown time and time again with the concept of induced demand on the impact of commuting times when more lanes have been added to cities/major roads.\n"

It\u2019s 2024, the world is trying to move away from cars and fossil fuel usage, so it makes no sense to pay money to remove these lanes, to add one more lane for cars (which realistically do nothing to aid the traffic in the city). Use this money instead to upgrade TTC services and for other programs encouraging drivers to find other modes of transport to get around the city. The majority of cars downtown are ones anyway, and better public transport will help with this! This all seems like a \u2018quick win\u2019 for the ontario government without actually affecting any real change\n"

        "comment": "Having provincial oversight in municipal bike lines is an absolutely ridiculous proposal. The Ontario government should not be involved in this process. There are much bigger issues for the Ontario government to manage that are in its purview already rather than which cities have bike lanes where.\nFor Toronto in particular, bike lanes improve traffic by reducing the number of people who have to drive. In the downtown core, driving should be discouraged as much as possible through congestion taxes or similar. Bike lanes provide safety for bikers so they're not mixed with vehicular traffic, which also speeds cars up as they don't have to avoid slower bikes.\nThe other proposal of ripping up existing bike lanes in Toronto is an even more ridiculous decision. It's a waste of money, time, and labor to do this after they were just installed. And that's not even to mention the benefits bike lanes provide on University Ave and the hospital staff that use them for their commute.\nPeople are going to continue to bike in dense downtown environments. Bike lanes are critical to encourage this behavior to reduce car traffic and move people through our cities safely and efficiently.\n"

        "comment": "The Oct 31st update to this proposal represents another example of the Ford government's abject failure to adopt anything vaguely representing evidence based decision making. Recently, an article published in the Toronto Star (\"Do cycling corridors really slow traffic? We fact-checked the bike lane blame game\") drew upon the available evidence to investigate the implications that bike lanes have on traffic in Toronto. This was a balanced report that clearly indicated occasions where the available data was lacking or even misleading (due to confounding variables such as traffic fluctuations due to the COVID-19 pandemic). With regard to the question of whether bike lanes have slowed traffic in Toronto, the data does not paint a clear picture. Nevertheless, Transportation Minister Prabmeet Sarkaria (whose education is in the fields of finance and law) confidently states that \"the removal of lanes of traffic on our busiest roads, such as Bloor Street, University Avenue, and Yonge Street, has only made gridlock worse.\" How can he know this? Is he privy to traffic data that these Toronto Star journalists were not? Do we really want to live in a society where public figures can simply create facts based on their own personal opinions? Mr Sakaria also notes that \u201cToronto already loses $11 billion each year due to congestion,\" which is a red herring with regard to whether bike lanes are significantly impeding the flow of traffic. It is shameful that public funds be wasted destroying infrastructure when there is no clear justification for said destruction.\n"

Zero data, rushed through and an absolutely absurd disregard for municipal planning realities (not to mention municipal decision making & authority).\nI am a regular cyclist, particularly along Bloor as well as other Toronto streets. If this nonsense embarassing legislation goes through, I will do one of two things: take up the FULL lane as permitted (sorry not sorry to the drivers stuck behind me; I'm just following the law!) or I will drive my car. The answer to traffic congestion is not to ADD MORE CARS . This is clearly an venal attempt by this government to reward some donor with the contract to destroy cycling infrastructure, and a vengeful act by a Premier who wanted to be Mayor of Toronto. I won't bother to list the environmental and emission impacts of shifting cyclists back into cars because this Government is incapable of comprehending that whole policy area. Want to reduce congestion? Charge drivers who come into the city in large vehicles, with a tax on oversize SUVs like the one the Premier uses, and a per- kilometre levy so drivers from Etobicoke, Mississauga and Oakville pay for the traffic and wear-and-tear they cause and perhaps are incentivized to take transit. This is a colossal power grab and insulting petty policy and the Ministry anchoring this legislation should be deeply ashamed.\n"
