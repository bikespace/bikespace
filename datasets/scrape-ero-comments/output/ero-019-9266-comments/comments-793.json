I am highly concerned about this bill, namely schedule 4, and the adverse affects that removing bike lanes from major Toronto streets will have. These adverse affects include:\n- Decreased safety for cyclists, putting them at greater risk of accidents with motor vehicles.\n- Increased traffic congestion, as more car lanes=more cars on the road.\n- Environmental risks, as increased motor vehicle usage has an adverse affect on the environment.\n- Health impacts, as motor vehicle commuting has adverse affects on one's physical health.\n- Economic disadvantages, as small business benefit from cyclists who visit local stores and restaurants.\nI am extremely disappointed in Bill 212 and will not be voting for the Conservative party unless this bill is repealed. As a commuter cyclist, I am genuinely concerned for my safety moving forward.\n"

Continuing to destroy environment to fund the pockets of ford's friends.\nSection 4: Actually supporting traffic is to reduce the number of cars on the road. Smarter civil planning and reliable transportation methods alternative to cars (like bikes) are the solution. Maintaining car focused infrastructure is the exact opposite of what you want to do when reducing commuting times, especially in larger cities like Toronto.\nDo a better job, and pass laws that will actually be helpful.\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nI am a resident of Toronto, and have been for my entire 41 years of life so far. To get around the city for work, shopping and recreation, I\u2019ve utilized driving, cycling and TTC. To remove one type of infrastructure to favour another is counterproductive, a waste of money and in the end, makes it harder and more dangerous for people to get around the city. By favouring cars over bikes in the removal of these bike lanes you are doing a disservice to the people of Toronto. If there are fewer safe bike lanes, you are discouraging cyclists from cycling and forcing them into cars - as I used to do - and thereby increasing traffic and gridlock. This is simple stuff and I know there are many studies that illustrate this. Your provincial government really shouldn\u2019t have the means to touch these bike lanes, which is further troubling. These are municipal issues, not provincial ones. Until I can see otherwise, it really seems like there is some personal vendetta that Doug Ford has against bike lanes and cyclists. Immature, short sighted and counter productive. Please leave the bike lanes as they are and stay out of municipal affairs!\n"

        "comment": "I am commenting specifically on Schedule 4: Highway Traffic Act of this Bill. The proposal in this Bill for the Ministry of Transportation to override municipal decisions to construct vital cycling infrastructure that responds to the priorities and needs of their constituents puts the lives of cyclists in danger.  Importantly, the intention of the Highway Traffic Act is to reduce gridlock in Ontario, particularly the GTA, but the data in Toronto does not support that the removal of bike lanes would achieve this. Premier Ford and Members of Provincial Parliament, I urge you reconsider Schedule 4: Highway Traffic Act of Bill 212.\nThe safety of cyclists and human life must be valued over a marginally faster commute by this government. Bike lanes on busy arterial roads like Bloor, Yonge, and University in Toronto are necessary to protect cyclists. There will be cyclists on these roads whether there are bike lanes or not, but bike lanes with barriers separating cyclists from motor vehicles provides a necessary layer of protection for cyclists. Even though there will be cyclists on these roads without bike lanes, there will and have been far more once bike lanes were installed. This mitigates an excess of vehicular traffic as more people feel comfortable cycling to work rather than taking cars. Furthermore, there are large-scale efficient transit routes along Bloor, Yonge, and University, so there is little reason for a mass of single-occupancy cars to be driving along these routes rather than taking transit. Research has shown that when you invest in and expand one type of infrastructure, then more people will use that infrastructure. In other words, if you build more lanes of traffic then more people will drive, if you build more bike lanes then more people will cycle, and if you build more public transit then more people will take public transit. If this government invested in bike lanes and public transit (like finally getting the Eglinton Crosstown LRT completed after 14 years of construction!) then perhaps some of the gridlock experienced in the GTA could be eased by now.\nThis Act\u2019s complete disregard for human life is concerning. As someone who cycles as a mode of transportation to get to work, community recreation programs, do groceries, etc., the addition of bike lanes on the west part of Bloor in particular have been game changing for me. Before the bike lanes on the west part of Bloor were installed, I worked a job where I would sometimes have to work early mornings, meaning that I would bike to work in the dark. One morning, I was unlocking a bike from the public bike share docks, and a car slammed into a parked car only about 25 metres up the street from where I was. If I had left just slightly earlier that could have very well could have been me getting hit since there were no barriers separating cars and cyclists like there are now. Additionally, as someone who also drives on occasion, I feel much better with the bike lanes installed since I don\u2019t have to worry about safely passing cyclists and finding opportunities to get into left lane. I believe bike lanes make the roads safer for cyclists and drivers alike. Beyond safety, cycling is a great way to take personal responsibility for reducing one\u2019s carbon footprint, contributing to making Ontario greener and hitting carbon emission targets.\nFinally, I am concerned about what this overreach of power means for municipalities and the precedent it sets. The purpose of municipal governance is to respond to the unique local needs of the community. Toronto residents elected this council to do exactly that, and they have done their best to do so. If Torontonians wanted more lanes for vehicular traffic, then we would have elected a council that would do that. This Act feels like a political move from Premier Ford who is using the lives of Torontonians as pawns to appease his suburban voter base in the GTA while knowing full well that the data shows his plan will not achieve its intended goal of reducing gridlock.\nI once again urge you to reconsider Bill 212. Removing crucial bike lanes in Toronto will not ease congestion, but it will put the lives of cyclists at risk and prevent municipalities from responding to local needs and priorities.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose Bill 212, the \"Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024,\" as it undermines local autonomy, disregards evidence-based urban planning, and threatens the progress made in fostering safer, more sustainable, and equitable cities. Municipalities like Toronto have invested years in creating bike lane networks that reduce traffic congestion, improve safety, and encourage active transportation, which is critical in addressing climate change and enhancing public health. Removing established bike lanes on key corridors like Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue will not only reverse these gains but also endanger cyclists and pedestrians, exacerbate gridlock by encouraging more car use, and increase greenhouse gas emissions. Centralizing decision-making on bike lanes at the provincial level dismisses the expertise and priorities of local governments that are more attuned to the needs of their communities. This bill fails to recognize that bike lanes are essential infrastructure for a sustainable future, not just \"optional\" road features. Public consultations and stakeholder input have repeatedly demonstrated strong support for bike lanes, and their removal contradicts both local and global commitments to combat the climate crisis. I urge the government to reject Bill 212 in its entirety and instead invest in infrastructure that prioritizes sustainable, multi-modal transportation solutions that truly reduce gridlock and support healthier, more vibrant communities.\n"

There are many peolle who are unable to drive or have access to a car and especially within urban settings, bike paths can provide the space for mobility scooters and other non-motor vehicular transportation to make the city more accessible in addition to actual bicycles. There is a long list of studies about the importance of providing alternative to driving to reduce road congestion due to induced demand. Dont ignore evidence based city planning for populist policies that make lives worse for the residence who live in the city. Furthermore, I don't understand why the province is weighing in on a municipal issue. That is entirely anti democratic and without just cause.

Before it was installed I was in fact injured while cycling on Bloor by someone getting out of an uber that stopped suddenly.\nI am also a driver in downtown Toronto. I drive more than I ride my bike these days as I am pregnant. Construction is by far the largest cause of traffic issues on city streets. Bike lanes make me feel protected in my car from hitting cyclists. With so much going on it's not difficult for accidents to take place. Cyclists are vulnerable road users and in a car I am very nervous about hurting them when we are sharing the road.\nI also want to note that there are numerous condos going up in my neighbourhood and along my route to work. The increased density is for sure going to increase traffic. In my opinion it would be better for traffic if there were bike lanes available rather than promoting more cars on the road as we do not have the road infrastructure. The TTC is also not reliable and safer cycling is the best way to get people moving.\nI don't know a single person who spends time downtown that supports the removal of these bike lanes. To remove them would be going against the will of the people they affect the most. Removal will cause bodily harm, increase car traffic, and waste money.\n"

Public transit not only reduces congestion but also provides a more sustainable and equitable transportation option for all residents, including those who cannot or choose not to drive.\nAs someone who does not rely on car infrastructure, the proposed highway-focused measures do not address my transportation needs. Instead, I would greatly benefit from enhanced transit services, bike lanes, and pedestrian-friendly infrastructure.\nDecades of research demonstrate that building more highways does not solve congestion issues in the long term. Expanding road capacity often induces demand, leading to the same level of gridlock on a larger scale. This approach simply shifts the problem rather than resolving it.\nThe solution to gridlock lies in reducing reliance on single-occupancy vehicles. This can be achieved through investments in comprehensive transit networks, active transportation options, and smart city planning that reduces the need for extensive commutes.\nI urge policymakers to reconsider the focus of this legislation and allocate resources toward sustainable, transit-focused solutions that better address congestion while fostering a healthier, more inclusive transportation system for all Ontarians.\n"

The priority was made for the bikers alone, a group that consists of about a handful of people instead of the whole neighborhood.\nI enjoy being outdoors, walking in the paths and riding my bike on occasion.

        "comment": "I strongly oppose the bill that proposes the removal of bike lanes from our heavily congested area. Numerous studies have consistently demonstrated the immense benefits that bike lanes bring to both safety and the environment. For instance, research by the *National Institute for Transportation and Communities* has shown that dedicated bike lanes significantly improve pedestrian safety. When bike lanes are present, collisions between cyclists and pedestrians decrease, as cyclists are separated from pedestrian traffic, creating a safer environment for all.\nMoreover, bike lanes play a crucial role in improving traffic flow. A study by the *Ministry of Transport in the Netherlands* found that when bike lanes are integrated into congested areas, car traffic tends to flow more smoothly because cyclists are given their own space, reducing the potential for accidents that can slow down vehicles. Additionally, bike lanes encourage more people to cycle rather than drive, which reduces the overall number of cars on the road and, consequently, reduces congestion.\nFrom an environmental standpoint, bike lanes are a key tool in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The *Environmental Protection Agency* (EPA) has highlighted that promoting cycling as a mode of transportation can significantly cut down on emissions, as it reduces the reliance on fossil fuel-powered vehicles. Cycling is a zero-emission mode of transport, and studies show that cities with extensive cycling infrastructure see a measurable drop in carbon emissions.\nRemoving bike lanes undermines these critical benefits and would be a step backward for our community in terms of safety, traffic efficiency, and environmental sustainability. We must continue to prioritize infrastructure that supports cycling and sustainable urban living.\n"
