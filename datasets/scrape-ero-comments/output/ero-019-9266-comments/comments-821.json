Taking away cycling lanes certainly makes it more dangerous. But guess what, taking away cycling lanes doesn't take away bikes, it just means they will mix together on the road. In this case Bloor, one of the busiest in the city. Now that is insane.\n"

Why is MY money being wasted reopening construction that has kept University, Bloor and Yonge closed and congested for years? And WHY is there now an increased threat of MY PROPERTY being taken from me without any due course?\nExtremely disingenuous and shady bill. This should be thrown out immediately.

In a time of growing climate crisis and economic scarcity, we need to increase our support of climate-friendly and cheaper transportation options such as bicycles. Environmental assessment is also critical in new infrastructure projects such as Highway 413 to ensure that we don\u2019t sacrifice our climate for the sake of convenience. Finally, I believe in minimizing government waste of resources, and am deeply opposed to the extra time and money needed o remove bike lanes which have already gone through a lengthy study and approval process to be put in place.\n"

        "comment": "I live just off Yonge St. The only way in or out of my condo is to use Yonge. Since the bike lanes reduced a lane both ways I deal with the unreasonable traffic on a daily basis. While I sit in gridlock for 20 minutes to travel a few blocks, less than a dozen bikes go by (not even factoring in the winter season which will mean even less bike use). I can't understand the logic that went into the thinking to reduce lanes on a major artery into and out of the Downton core. I don't think a traffic study was necessary to tell us the obvious--loss of vehicle lanes will cause gridlock!!!\nI would like to remind the city that the cyclists are not the ones keeping the downtown economy running. It's the professionals driving to work, shopping, taking public transit, going out to restaurants, paying for gas etc in the city core. So don't make it difficult for us to do so.\nNot to mention how unattractive our Yonge, Bloor etc streets look. The stanchions look cheap and are falling over, we have concrete blocks on the road (painting them blue doesn't make them prettier) and turquoise lines painted on the road corners.  I just returned from Amsterdam. A beautiful city that accommodates cycling yet still manages to maintain an elegant appearance. They don't need plastic poles and paint telling them how to drive around cyclists.\nCity planners need to do better for our city.\n"

Either have less lanes than before or have had their widths cut back. Congestion in areas, especially along Sheppard where condos are popping up all over with thousands of people moving into the area. Fire, police and ambulance services have a hard time getting to NYGH and Sunnybrook along Sheppard and have had to use ongoing traffic lanes to get through. There are enough side streets and park paths that can be used instead.\nGet rid of the bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "I would like to express my profound disagreement with the approach being taken by the Government of Ontario to address gridlock in the province. Transportation is a key issue and I think everyone can agree that more should be done to get people moving and where they need to go. I believe that the focus should be on providing multiple options for people to get around their cities and in between cities.\nThe proposed legislation targets \"bike lanes\" as a cause of gridlock. Cars cause gridlock, not bike lanes. Bike lanes provide an additional option for people to get around their cities and at a fraction of the cost of owning a motor vehicle. In the cost of living crisis that we are facing, the Government of Ontario should be incentivizing and supporting people to make trips and even forgo car ownership. There is a variety of reasons that the Government of Ontario should be providing freedom of choice when it comes to transportation. Many people do live within walking or cycling to the places where they work, shop, go to school or meet their friends. The Province should be providing a SAFE means for those people to get to where they need to go. Divided bike lanes help make cycling safer.\nI live in Ottawa Ontario, 4km from downtown where my office is. I own a car but chose to cycle to work 8 months of the year. Yes I am still biking now in November! If I were to drive, it would take me 15-20+ minutes depending on traffic to get to work (more time to find parking). It takes me 13-15minutes minutes by bike. I chose to bike because it is just as fast as driving and I avoid the hassle and financial burden (20$/ day to park). Its the obvious choice for me and I find there are immense positive physical and mental health benefits to this choice.\nMore people would choose to bike if they were provided with SAFE and effective bike lane network to get around their cities.  I acknowledge that not everyone has this option and some people need to drive to work. That is ok, however, we need to balance out transportation modes and consider what we want our cities to look like in the future rather than looking back at how they were.\nThe Government of Ontario should repeal the proposed legislation and work collaboratively with municipalities on transportation issues such as gridlock. Citizens elect their city officials to make decisions around transportation and where efforts need to be spent. Local officials know best and have spent time, money and other resources coming up with future plans on how to meet their cities transportation needs.\n"

        "comment": "Protected cycle tracks serve as a critical piece of infrastructure for myself and many others. I for one use our current bike infrastructure in Toronto to support local businesses along with doing daily errands and going to appointments. The data shows that bike infrastructure improves the quality of life for our community, and we have to expand bike infrastructure to make our community even stronger!\nI drive as well, and find that driving in car centric areas brings out the worst drivers even more as the wide roads enable dangerous driving. Anecdotally, traffic isn\u2019t any better in places like Scarborough and North York (where mostly just car oriented infrastructure exist) compared to Old Toronto (which has more active transportation).\nBill 212 will not reduce traffic. The 401 is the widest freeway in Canada, while also being the most congested.\nWith this, I am speaking out against Bill 212 as it gets in the way of the positive economic, social, and environmental impacts bike lanes produce, with no guarantee of reducing traffic!\n"

        "comment": "The Guelph Coalition for Active Transportation (GCAT) respectfully expresses concern regarding the proposal for increased provincial oversight on local transportation planning decisions outlined in Bill 212. GCAT values the principle of municipal autonomy and believes municipalities are well-equipped to make informed decisions about their local transportation infrastructure, given their close connection to the unique needs of their communities and commitment to thorough consultation processes.\nCycling lanes are essential infrastructure that enhance safety for all road users, alleviate traffic congestion, and contribute to healthier, more sustainable communities. Restricting the development of bike lanes could inadvertently increase reliance on cars, heighten emissions, and reduce safety for cyclists, pedestrians, and drivers alike. These outcomes would seem to run counter to Ontario\u2019s goals of fostering diverse transportation options and supporting housing solutions that encourage density and reduce car dependency.\nGCAT encourages a collaborative approach between the province and municipalities to ensure the development of balanced, inclusive transportation systems. Empowering local decision-making aligns with shared goals of building livable, sustainable cities while prioritizing the health, safety, and mobility of all Ontarians.\n"

I use the downtown bike lanes to shuttle my nine-year old child to weekend activities because public transit does not operate early enough, it keeps her fit and healthy, teaches her valuable skills, and is fun. I also ride thousands of kilometers each year around the GTHA on my road bike. I have for over thirty years.\nTraffic in the city is caused by seemingly endless construction that clogs the highways and major roads that lead to the suburbs. It is exasperated by aggressive, dangerous drivers that refuse to obey traffic laws and 'fill the box' at busy intersections because they can get away with it. Because there is no enforcement.\nTraffic in Toronto is not caused by cyclists. Give your collective political heads a shake. Data from major cities like London and New York that have abandoned the stupid war on bikes and embraced cycling as a useful mode of transportation have all proven that cycling infrastructure is a vital part of urban infrastructure. The use of bicycles will only increase over time as the adoption of ebikes increases, the cost of transit increases and car ownership becomes like home ownership - a dream.\nBikes are here to stay. If the Ford government removes the bike lanes on Yonge, Bloor and University, they will be responsible for injuries and deaths of countless bike riders - recreational, commuters, gig workers. People just like me and my daughter that rely on these bike lanes. There will be blood on their  hands and I hope they rot in whatever hell they believe in.\nShame on Doug Ford and shame on Ontario PCs for playing politics with the lives of cyclists. They need to fix real problems facing Ontarians such as healthcare, education and the environment - and stay out of the affairs of cities. They need to stay in their own damn lane.\n"

This bill that includes the proposal to remove bike lanes is, in my opinion, a terrible idea for many reasons, but especially in terms of safety and sustainability. Adding motor vehicle lanes does NOT always mean an improvement to traffic congestion. Have any traffic engineering studies been performed in the areas where these changes are proposed? Any Environmental Assessments to compare the positive and negative environmental effects of the changes?\nPeople want a walkable city. For a city like Toronto, this is a huge appeal to the area. Cyclists need a safe place to ride. The government should be encouraging and facilitating active transportation facilities so the roads are equitable for all users.\n"

Why is this government directing millions of dollars to rip out already established infrastructure in Toronto when that money could be used to improve infrastructure elsewhere in the province? What a waste! The concentration of attention and money in Toronto when the rest of the province is struggling is absolutely enraging and offensive. Ontario is more than just Toronto. Instead of spending money to rip out bike lanes in Toronto, the Government of Ontario needs to direct those funds province-wide towards hiring and paying nurses more so that they don't have to work double shifts and then quit their jobs because they are so burnt out. Rather than meddling in municipal affairs and throwing a tantrum over bike lanes in Toronto, the Government of Ontario needs to grow up and finally start investing in healthcare and education.\n"

        "comment": "To the Honorable Members of Government,\nI write to you today with a deep sense of urgency and concern, imploring you to reconsider the passage of Bill 212. As someone who lives east of Toronto, outside of the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), I can tell you firsthand that our communities rely heavily on bicycle paths and bike lanes to connect from town to town, especially for those of us who do not have access to a car.\nFor many, the bicycle is not just a leisure activity or a choice; it is a lifeline. It\u2019s how we get to work, to school, to essential services, and to visit family and friends. It is an integral part of our daily lives, providing both mobility and independence. However, if this bill passes, I fear that the safety of those who rely on these bike lanes will be gravely compromised. The paths we currently use are already precarious in places, and this bill, in its current form, will only serve to make them more dangerous.\nI implore you to consider the real-world consequences of your actions. For many people in my community, cycling is not an optional activity\u2014it is a necessity. We are not talking about a small group of people, but rather the lives of many who are now at risk. The implications of this bill are not abstract; they are immediate and personal. I cannot, in good conscience, support a policy that puts my life and the lives of others in danger.\nPlease do not risk the lives of your constituents for the sake of a bill that fails to account for the realities of how people live, work, and move in this region. The impact of this decision will be felt not just on the roads, but in the very fabric of our communities. If this bill passes, I will be forced to reconsider my support for this government, and I will not hesitate to withhold my vote in future elections.\nI am asking you, as a representative of the people, to listen to our concerns and protect the safety of those who depend on safe, accessible bike paths and lanes. Please do not allow this legislation to pass and endanger our lives.\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n"
