        "comment": "Thank you for allowing Ontario residents to express their opinions about the proposed legislation. I hope all comments are considered fairly and without personal biases.\nPlease consider the following points:\n- Active modes of transportation should be encouraged, not discouraged.\n- The only way to reduce congestion is by removing cars from the road.\n- Toronto does not have a complete cycling network, which is why some roads currently have less cycling usability than others.\n- Condominiums are increasingly being built with fewer or no parking spots; in the future, we must expand biking infrastructure to accommodate new users.\n- Removing bike lanes and allowing bikes to share the road with cars will not only be unsafe for cyclists but will also slow down traffic even further.\n- Side streets do not run parallel with main streets, meaning there are no viable options to relocate current cycling tracks to side streets.\nAlthough I do not personally cycle, I primarily use the TTC and drive when necessary. However, I feel uncomfortable sharing the same lane with cyclists, as it is unsafe for both parties.\nI do not support the removal of bike lanes from Bloor, University, and Yonge.\nIf the government is concerned about roads where car lanes were reduced, the entire width of the road should be evaluated when installing bike lanes. Sidewalk and car lane widths can be adjusted to accommodate bike lanes. Again, we need to encourage more modes of transportation, not fewer. Cities around the world have reached similar conclusions, so we should avoid stepping into regressive policies that we may regret later.\nThis government promised to reduce red tape and limit gatekeeping, yet this legislation introduces additional gatekeeping and strengthens government control over our daily lives.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong support for the preservation and expansion of bike lanes in Toronto and to urge the Ontario government to continue investing in and supporting cycling infrastructure across our province. Bike lanes are a critical element of our city's transportation network, offering a sustainable, safe, and efficient alternative to cars, and their benefits extend far beyond Toronto alone.\nBike lanes make our streets safer for everyone. They provide a designated space for cyclists, which reduces collisions and pedestrian injuries, while also calming traffic for all road users. This infrastructure encourages more people to choose cycling, which reduces the number of cars on the road, alleviating traffic congestion and improving commute times for drivers and public transit users alike.\nBeyond road safety, bike lanes contribute significantly to public health and environmental sustainability. Encouraging more people to cycle helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions, an urgent priority in the face of climate change. Moreover, cycling promotes a healthy, active lifestyle, reducing the strain on our healthcare system by lowering the incidence of obesity, heart disease, and other health conditions associated with a sedentary lifestyle.\nAdditionally, investing in bike lanes supports our economy. Studies show that bike lanes encourage people to shop locally, as cyclists are more likely to stop at businesses along their route than those driving cars. Furthermore, a robust cycling infrastructure attracts talent and investment by enhancing the city's appeal to businesses and residents who value sustainable, forward-thinking urban planning.\nI understand there are concerns that bike lanes reduce road space and affect car traffic. However, evidence from other cities shows that balanced, well-planned cycling infrastructure can coexist with vehicular traffic, leading to a more integrated and resilient transportation network.\nFor these reasons, I respectfully urge the Ontario government to support bike lanes and to consider further investments in expanding cycling infrastructure. By doing so, we can build a healthier, safer, and more sustainable Ontario for all residents.\nThank you\n"

        "comment": "I do not support the idea of removing existing bike infrastructure or adding additional regulation around the creation of new bike lanes. The provincial government increasing the amount of bureaucracy and red tape involved in the city planning process will not solve any of our transportation problems. As a driver in the city of Toronto, I much prefer to drive on routes with separated cycling traffic. Cyclists riding in mixed traffic has a significant impact on traffic flow, and makes travel more dangerous for both drivers and cyclists as drivers try to cut around them. Removing bike lanes will force cyclists into mixed traffic, resulting in worse outcomes for both cyclists and drivers. Ripping out brand new infrastructure is also a huge waste of my tax money, that could be better spent on actual solutions to the congestion problem.\n"

        "comment": "The bike lanes should be kept. This is important for keeping down congestion in the downtown area, particularly as there are many commuters, students, workers, delivery services, and more people that use the bike lanes along University, Bloor, and Yonge. Scrapping the bike lanes will also shift more commuters to the Toronto Subway, which will put more strain on an overburdened line. From a university student standpoint, many students of the University of Toronto and Toronto Metropolitan University are regular cyclists. Scrapping the bike lane will disrupt their commutes.\n"

It is true there is a crippling traffic problem in Toronto, and to a lesser degree in other cities across Ontario, but reducing access to ALTERNATE forms of transport is counterintuitive and shortsighted.\nIt takes a very quick google search to find research and data on the effects of bike lanes versus additional car lanes for easing congestion. Bike lanes are the clear winner. How can this bill be proposed when it seems to have no factual basis?\nFrankly, this legislation is an embarrassment to the province of Ontario as it highlights how out of touch politicians can be. This bill does NOT reflect people\u2019s desire for more green cities, the realities of car congestion, or anything beyond a blind, top-down approach to fixing a problem in a completely backward and decidedly unhelpful way.\nThank you for your time.\n"

More cars on the road means longer traffic jams, More congestion, and ultimately a worse experience for everybody using the street, drivers walkers, bikers, and everything in between.\n"

        "comment": "THANK YOU PREMIER FORD!!\nThe decision to create bike lanes on major streets without fully considering their impact on congestion is truly perplexing.\nI support having bike lanes, but they are far more practical on secondary streets. Premier Ford\u2019s observation resonates with me; less than 1% of people use these lanes, even in favourable weather.\nI\u2019m at a loss as to how the City justified installing so many lanes without more logical planning (beyond an attempt to push people toward transit - i.e. their war with the car).\nLiving in downtown Toronto, I try to walk everywhere and only drive when absolutely necessary. I frequently notice how underutilized the bike lanes (during the four winter months, sightings of cyclists are extremely rare), and how streetcars contribute to gridlock.\nThoughtful, strategic planning could go a long way in addressing these issues.  To alleviate congestion, the City (with help from the Province):\n1) Relocate bike lanes from primary streets to less congested routes\n2) Replace streetcars with electric buses, and\n3) Prioritize the completion of the Ontario Line\n"

        "comment": "This proposed bill is ridiculous. It is turning back the clock on all of the amazing progress that has been made to help improve biking infrastructure and make roads much safer for cyclists, drivers and pedestrians alike. Doug Ford should be looking into promoting and improving alternate forms of transportation such as bike lanes, bus routes and subway systems instead of focusing on vehicle centered travel only.\nCyclists are not using portions of the biking routes since they are sometimes unfinished and dangerous to ride on. I have seen unprotected bike lanes being used by vehicles as a parking spot instead of their intended purpose, leading to dangerous situations. I myself have been hit by a vehicle while riding my bike on the road because there was no biking infrastructure in place (ie: protected lanes). Since that time, I have been reluctant to ride my bike on any roads for fear of getting hit again and not being so lucky the next time. There are more and more things that can easily distract drivers on the road and without proper biking infrastructure, the chance of accidents happening will only increase as time goes on.\nPlease make the right decision and get rid of this bill for the safety of everyone!\n"

        "comment": "I whole heartedly do not agree with this proposal. First, I believe the emphasis should be on working to make the province less vehicle focused, especially in urban centres. Second the exception allowing for new highway builds to bypass the Environmental Assessment Act is a step in the wrong direction. Removing bicycle lanes to make room for vehicles will not help ease congestion in a meaningful way. Public transit, and bicycle lanes allow for a much larger number of travellers per area than motor vehicles. Designated bicycle lanes are also safer, especially in the urban centres such as along those streets which the proposal aims to remove them. Many people are of the opinion that they do not feel safe bicycling in downtown Toronto without bikes lanes, so removing them will force more people to resort to driving, further exacerbating the congestion. Finally, the removal of existing bicycle lanes is simply put a waster of tax-payer funds. Converting existing bicycle lanes into traffic lanes may well result in a loss of revenue for the TTC as more commuters take private transportation. This would compound the financial loss resulting from replacing the bicycle lanes themselves. These funds would be much better utilized investing in projects in healthcare, public transportation, and other areas which would lead to long-term benefits for the province.\nThis leads me to the final issue I have with the proposal, being the utter disregard it shows to one of the most immediate problems of population growth: the environment. It is obvious and has been known for quite a long time that society cannot continue to grow without taking into account the impact such growth has on the environment. For a government which claims to care about the environment, this proposal shows with shocking clarity that this could not be further from the truth. Exempting Highway 413 from the Environmental Assessment act simply put, prioritizes short term growth over sustainable, long term wellness for the province. Any project, let alone one as large as that of highway 413, has the potential to deal irreparable harm to the environment and by extension to us. Allowing for exemptions from environmental assessments is shortsighted and irresponsible, putting the future of Ontario at risk. The same is true for the removal of bicycle lanes for the prioritization of vehicle traffic. The focus now needs to be building and improving existing methods of low emission travel.\nThis proposal shows a shocking lack of regard for my future and the future of the province as a whole, and I will not support it.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my concern and opposition to the proposed bill regarding the removal of bike lanes in Toronto. This proposal is short-sighted, especially when considering the critical role that bike infrastructure plays in the development of world-class cities and in addressing the transportation needs of modern urban populations.\nBike lanes are an essential component of a sustainable urban transportation system. They are a means to reduce traffic congestion, lower greenhouse gas emissions, promote healthy living, and enhance overall quality of life in cities. Toronto, like many other cosmopolitan cities around the world, should be striving to support these outcomes by completing and expanding its cycling infrastructure, not dismantling it. Currently, Toronto\u2019s bike lanes lack crucial connectivity and continuity, leaving many of our city\u2019s residents unable to rely on cycling as a consistent or safe mode of transportation. With a complete and cohesive network, we could see a marked increase in bicycle usage, as has been demonstrated in other leading cities such as Amsterdam, Copenhagen, and New York City. Yes, you read that right New York City. Let's go into detail on that, as without knowing, you might find that to be an inaccurate statement or perhaps, even, not true. Well, New York City has made significant strides in developing a robust cycling infrastructure over the past few decades, resulting in notable growth in cycling for both commuting and recreational purposes. Currently, NYC has more than 1,500 miles of bike lanes, of which over 600 miles are protected lanes, helping reduce cycling risks in busy urban areas. Protected bike lanes have not only improved safety but also reduced traffic congestion and travel times for other vehicles in certain corridors. For example, the addition of bike lanes on 8th Avenue reduced travel times for cars by 14%, highlighting the benefit of dedicated cycling infrastructure even for non-cyclists. New York City's success underscores the importance of a consistent, connected infrastructure that encourages cycling as a viable mode of urban transportation.\nIt is also worth questioning the legitimacy of this initiative at the provincial level. The municipal government is much closer to the needs and preferences of Toronto\u2019s residents and should be the primary authority on decisions regarding local bike lanes. The involvement of the provincial government in this matter seems out of place and appears to set a concerning precedent of overreach. If any government body were to oversee such decisions, it would be more appropriate for federal authorities to provide guidelines supporting sustainability goals that align with national and international standards.\nThe proposal to remove bike lanes reflects a fundamental misalignment with the values of urban growth and environmental responsibility. This recalls other poorly conceived initiatives, such as the recent (implemented and reversed) changes to Ontario\u2019s vehicle license plates\u2014a project that was costly, poorly executed, and ultimately scrapped. Such decisions are a waste of both public resources and government focus, casting doubt on the credibility and priorities of those in power.\nYou need to reconsider this proposal and to instead focus efforts on completing and enhancing Toronto\u2019s cycling infrastructure. Investing in a connected and accessible bike lane network will create a safer, more resilient city and contribute positively to Toronto\u2019s role as a modern, forward-thinking urban center.\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n"

There is one way to cut down on gridlock and that is investing in robust public transit and public space. Bike lanes are a crucial component in this. You dont need to be an expert to know this - its basic city planning.\nAside from this, they also keep cyclists safe in a city whose infrastructure is widely hostile to them. The existing bike lanes are the absolute bare minimum and vastly lag behind other major cities in Canada and the world. Cyclists deserve a city that they can commute flexibly in without worrying for their lives.\nOf course, cyclists are most often the lowest-income people in the city so I don't expect Ford or any of his Conservative buddies to care about their lives, as they have continually proven over and over again.\n"

The pros of improving bike accessibility far outweighs the cons. Thanks to bike lanes, it was possible for me to go to work without taking a car.\nThis is good for the environment, good for congestion, good for my physical and mental health. It allowed me to contribute more meaningfully to the economy by saving on car expenses and purchasing more locally.\nMaking Bike lanes harder to build and destroying current bike lanes all for just 'one more car lane' is a fool's errand. Those who even proposed this should be ashamed of themselves. While this may improve traffic on the short term, induced demand will maintain the current traffic flow over time and is not sustainable. To reduce traffic, we need to improve scalability of our finite resources. We need to get more vehicles off the road. This means more biking and public transport options.\nPlease reconsider. This is a disastrous policy and will harm Ontario overall.\n"
