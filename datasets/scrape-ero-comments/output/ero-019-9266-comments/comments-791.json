You need bike lanes. Without them bikes, cars and trucks will all be in the road together. The roads are not wide enough to support all at the same time which is exactly what you will end up with. This will just lead to even more congestion than we already have not to mention the danger it presents. The flow of traffic will worsen not by improve.\nThis a complete waste of $48 million of tax payers money. Tell Doug Ford he\u2019s an idiot!!\n"

By taking away bike lanes you are taking away easy ways to get around. bike are easy to hop on and off no parking. Easy to do errands, meet up with friends, stimulate the economy and spend money. By favouring car you are helping people get to point A to point B, however you are not helping people enjoy and live in this city.\nBy taking away bike lanes you are taking away quality of life, local economy and without a doubt people\u2019s lives.\nI have never enjoyed a day in a car but some of my best memories in this city have been on a bike.\n"

        "comment": "I am strongly opposed to the removal of bike lanes.  Reducing gridlock is NOT about bike lanes, there are simply too many vehicles on the road and we need to work on getting people out of their cars and onto alternate modes of transport like bicycles, ebikes, motorized scooters, public transportation, car pooling and walking.    Vehicles are bigger and usually carry one person.  This takes up a huge amount of space on our roads.  WIth a growing population, the focus needs to be, how do we get people out of their cars and onto alternate modes.  This will make the city more liveable, with cleaner air and more walkable, liveable space.\n"

        "comment": "Besides spending tax payer money unnecessarily. Bill 212 is a backward move in terms of environmental protection, among other issues. Many people, including young and old adults, cannot afford to drive motorized vehicles. Bicycle lanes give many cyclists a better sense of security when they're riding in the city. If anything, more lanes should be built to accommodate the increase in the number of people riding bikes, e-scooters, and other non-fueled devices in Toronto. If there were more bike lanes, I believe there would be greater interest in the use of the lanes. I understand drivers are concerned about having fewer lanes to use in the city, but I also notice many cars do not carry any passengers much of the time. I see a lot of SUVs that only contain one person. Traffic congestion could be significantly reduced if more people participated in ride-sharing. The other problem that should be addressed is to improve public transit to encourage more people to leave their cars at home. Unfortunately, it does not seem as reliable as it once was due to past failure to keep the system updated.\n"

As someone who lives in downtown Toronto, we pay a premium to live here and with that should come the right and the accessibility to bike safely on the street. Our taxes should not go to accommodate those who live outside of the city. That is all ripping up the bike lanes will do. To accommodate for more cars coming into the city. If people want to come downtown, they can take transportation or move like those of us who live here  have. By ripping up the bike lanes, you are putting cyclist at risk.\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nI am submitting this comment to express my strong opposition to Bill 212, including the provisions within the Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024 and the Highway 413 Act, 2024. While I understand the government\u2019s intent to address transportation issues, the proposed legislation poses significant risks to Ontario\u2019s environment, communities, and governance, and I am strongly opposed to it.\n1. Environmental Implications\nThe proposed exemption of Highway 413 and related projects from standard environmental assessments is deeply concerning. These assessments are not bureaucratic obstacles\u2014they are essential safeguards designed to protect Ontario\u2019s natural resources, biodiversity, and communities from irreversible harm.\nBy enabling construction to proceed without comprehensive reviews, this legislation:\n- Threatens over 400 acres of environmentally sensitive Greenbelt land, as noted by Environmental Defence. This destruction undermines Ontario's commitment to environmental stewardship.\n- Risks exacerbating climate change by prioritizing car-dependent infrastructure over sustainable alternatives like public transit and cycling infrastructure.\n- Ignores the critical role of the Greenbelt in flood prevention, carbon sequestration, and biodiversity protection.\n2. Promoting Unsustainable Transportation Policies\nThe bill\u2019s restrictions on bike lane installation and its provisions for removing existing bike lanes represent a step backward in Ontario\u2019s urban planning. This approach disregards mounting evidence of the benefits of cycling infrastructure:\n- Traffic Management: Removing bike lanes does not alleviate congestion. On the contrary, it forces cyclists into vehicle lanes, worsening traffic flow and increasing the likelihood of accidents.\n- Public Health and Safety: Bike lanes improve safety not just for cyclists but for all road users. They also encourage healthier lifestyles and reduce the burden on Ontario\u2019s healthcare system.\n - Economic Growth: Studies have shown that businesses along bike-friendly streets experience increased foot traffic and economic activity.\n- Environmental Goals: Cycling infrastructure is essential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, particularly as Ontario experiences the impacts of climate change.\nInvesting in sustainable transportation, including bike lanes and public transit, is a far more effective and equitable use of resources than highway expansion projects.\n3. Erosion of Property Rights and Worker Protections\nThe proposed changes to expropriation laws under the Highway 413 Act, 2024 are deeply troubling. Removing property owners' ability to seek a delayed possession date undermines their rights and sets a dangerous precedent for government overreach. It also risks eroding public trust in the government\u2019s ability to act transparently and fairly.\nAdditionally, the legislation\u2019s impact on infrastructure workers, particularly engineers and land surveyors, cannot be ignored. Reports indicate that these professionals have been without a contract for 20 months and are underpaid compared to their counterparts in other jurisdictions. This legislation not only fails to address these workforce issues but potentially exacerbates them by removing key regulations and undermining the bargaining power of skilled professionals. Failing to invest in fair wages and worker retention will create delays and safety risks in critical infrastructure projects.\n4. Lack of Transparency and Public Consultation\nThe manner in which this legislation has been developed raises serious questions about transparency and accountability. The Premier\u2019s statements suggesting that decisions on specific bike lanes, such as those on Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue, have already been made contradict the notion of a rigorous, evidence-based process. This undermines public confidence in the legislative process and excludes meaningful input from municipalities and residents.\n5. Financial Mismanagement\nHighway 413\u2019s projected cost of over $8 billion is a staggering expense for a project unlikely to deliver the promised benefits. Decades of research have shown that expanding highways does not reduce congestion\u2014it induces demand, leading to more cars, more traffic, and greater emissions. These funds could be better allocated toward modernizing public transit, repairing existing infrastructure, and expanding active transportation networks, all of which offer higher returns on investment and better serve Ontario\u2019s long-term needs.\n6. Call to Action - Goal\nI urge the government to:\n1. Abandon Bill 212 and its associated provisions for Highway 413.\n 2. Commit to a transparent, inclusive process for evaluating transportation infrastructure projects.\n 3. Invest in sustainable, forward-looking solutions that prioritize public transit, cycling infrastructure, and environmental conservation.\n 4. Address the legitimate concerns of skilled workers by ensuring fair contracts, competitive wages, and appropriate workforce retention strategies.\nOntario\u2019s transportation policies must reflect the values of safety, sustainability, and equity, not short-term gains at the expense of our shared future. Bill 212 fails to meet these standards and risks causing significant harm to our province.\nThank you for considering this submission. I strongly encourage the government to prioritize policies that benefit all Ontarians, protect our environment, and build a sustainable future.\nSincerely,\nA resident of Etobicoke Centre, who has previously raised these issues to MPP Surma\n"

        "comment": "This portion of Bill 212 has been overfocused on by the government in an attempt to portray Bill 212 as a bike lane bill and to hide all the other items they are trying to push through. However, even though this section only takes up 1.5 of the 28 pages of Bill 212 I still want to talk about the reasons bike lanes are great and how this an overstep of Provincial powers.\nBike lanes are essential transportation infrastructure that support a full transit plan and can be the connecting piece for other public/active transport. Allowing people to easily bike places takes more cars off the road, reducing traffic, and making it easier to get around. Safety for drivers and bicyclists is increased when bicyclists have protected bike lanes to travel in. If I\u2019m driving, I prefer bicyclists to have their own lane. When I\u2019m on a bike, I also prefer to have my own lane. Anytime I\u2019m travelling I want bicyclists to have their own lane. We shouldn\u2019t have more red tape and bureaucracy slowing down municipal governments doing what is best for their cities.\nThe Ontario Society of Professional Engineers, which represents the entire engineering community in Ontario, just put out a response saying Bill 212 is a step in the wrong direction. Even with a heavy focus on the bike lane component of this bill, engineers across the province agree that it\u2019s still a bad idea! We need an emphasis on multi-modal transportation and that includes bike lanes for bicyclists.\n"

        "comment": "Dear Premier Ford,\nI wish to express my opposition to the passing of Bill 212 which would eradicate specific bike lanes in Downtown Toronto and require the City to ask permission from the Province to create new bike lanes..\nNot only is this an outrageous waste of tax payers money, but the narrative being given that it will create less gridlock for traffic is absolute nonsense.\nThe City of Toronto Council has done extensive research about transit in the City, whereas the so called \"research\" that the Province is claiming on this issue is sorely lacking. In fact many of their statistics about the use of bike lanes is completely out of date.\nWhy is the Province pursuing such a regressive measure instead of moving forward with the times? The number of people who rely on cycling not just to commute but for daily tasks and or recreation has increased dramatically. More effort and should be put into how to improve and increase public transit, and to decrease the number of cars (often with one passenger) coming into the downtown core.\nThank you.\n"

TTC is not a valid option as several times per day, it is broken and or not working. Busy professionals CANNOT rely on this.\nI would not be able to run my business effectively without them and neither would some of my employees.\nWe're in a crisis here in the GTA where we lack multiple modes of transport. Prioritizing car lanes will not solve the issue short term and it certainly will NOT do so over the long term. The issue is that the only dependable way to get around is by car. Bicycle lanes have offered some sort of alternative to that and it would be a very backward and illogical move to revert. Wasting our hard-earned tax dollars. We did not elect Premier Ford to do this.\nPlease revisit Bill 212 Premier and please exclude the bicycle lanes. We in the 905 and Etobicoke region enjoy them.\nYour next election and political credibility will depend on it.\n"
