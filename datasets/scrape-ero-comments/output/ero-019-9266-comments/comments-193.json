No serious city in the world is taking out bike lanes - they are being added in New York and Paris - but it seems Doug Ford\u2019s administration is intent on making Toronto unserious and backwards.  An acquaintance of ours was one of the cyclist deaths  this year - and there will be much more cyclist blood on these streets if this critical infrastructure is ripped out.\n"

I\u2019m a car owner and cyclist in Toronto and always choose to cycle over drive now that the protected Bloor bike lanes exist, year round. Cycling infrastructure reduces congestion - it doesn\u2019t contribute to it. But regardless of the evidence this government is choosing to ignore, this proposal is anti-democratic. Go ruin the cities where your car-obsessed voting base lives you small and spiteful people.\n"

        "comment": "I oppose Bill 212, particularly its requirement to remove dedicated bike lanes as a solution to reduce traffic gridlock. The Toronto Complete Streets Program provides a forward-thinking approach that demonstrates the importance of designing streets for everyone\u2014not just for people in cars. The Complete Streets initiative emphasizes that our streets are shared public spaces for all users, including cyclists, pedestrians, public transit users, and drivers. The removal of bike lanes, a key component of this vision, would not only make Toronto\u2019s streets less accessible, less safe, and less inclusive but also lead to a significant increase in traffic congestion and potential accidents.\n1. Bike Lanes Reduce Car Dependency and Alleviate Traffic: When bike lanes are available, people are more inclined to choose cycling over driving, especially for short trips. This shift reduces the number of cars on the road, which is one of the most effective ways to decrease congestion. Removing bike lanes would take away this option, forcing more people to use cars, which only adds to traffic volume and gridlock.\n2. Safety and Accessibility for All Road Users: Toronto\u2019s Complete Streets Program promotes a safer, more accommodating environment for all types of road users by dedicating space to each form of travel. Bike lanes provide cyclists a safe space, reducing accidents and improving traffic flow. When cyclists are forced to share lanes with cars, drivers often have to slow down and carefully navigate around them, creating more delays and making streets less safe for everyone.\n3. Sustainability and Environmental Impact: The Complete Streets approach aligns with Toronto\u2019s environmental goals by encouraging active transportation, which helps lower emissions. Cycling is a clean, zero-emission mode of transportation, and removing bike lanes discourages people from choosing this sustainable option. Increasing car dependency by limiting active transportation options will likely lead to higher pollution levels, which affects everyone in the community.\n4. Investing in Multi-Modal Transportation: Cities worldwide recognize the value of diverse, multi-modal transportation systems that support more than just car travel. Reducing bike lanes goes against this shift and locks us into an unsustainable, car-centric future. Instead, we need to expand infrastructure that supports people moving in all forms, reinforcing that streets are for everyone.\nCity streets are not just for cars; they are public spaces that serve everyone. Removing bike lanes will not reduce gridlock; it will worsen it by encouraging more cars on the road and limiting access for those who choose active transportation. To achieve a livable, sustainable, and safe city, we need policies that support diverse, accessible transportation options for all residents.\nFrom a downtown living, bike riding, Commie Pinko.\n"

This means my car sits at home (yes, I'm a driver), and is not causing congestion. I cannot stress enough how common my story is: bike lanes REDUCE congestion, not cause it.\nWhen I bike to work every morning, I am surround by parents and kids biking to school. They deserve to be safe and protected. Do not put children at risk over some ideological pretense.\nPublic funds are limited and precious: use them in evidence-based ways. Follow the research. It tells you that reducing congestion can only happen with road tolls, better public transit, and MORE bike lanes and bike infrastructure.\n"

Study after study has shown that merely expanding car infrastructure, in response to increased traffic, provides no long-term improvement to the issue of traffic and grid-lock.\n2. Such action *encourages* more cars on the roads, compounding an already very serious climate problem.\n3. Conversely, installation of bike lanes increases safety of those people on bicycles, thereby encouraging their use and removing cars from the roads.\nA strong, bicycle-friendly infrastructure, combined with a strong public transport infrastructure will be the best path to reducing both traffic woes and further impact on climate.\n"

Since local municipalities consult with local residents and apply local measures to address local mobility options, solutions arrived at locally should remain as such. If the province decides to proceed, it is suggested that such legislation only apply to restrict bike lanes on roads that have direct connections to provincial highways, thereby ensuring that these highways continue to operate to move vehicles as they were originally planned.\nIt is also suggested that instead of investigating tunnelling under highway 401, that the province advance the initiation of the 407 transit way, investigate the use of existing hydro corridors that cross the gta for transportation infrastructure and remove tolls on the provincially owned and operated portion of highway 407 from Brock Road to highway 35/115.\n"

Also, removing protections so you can push forward several major highways that will not benefit the majority of the residents of Ontario is also a waste of tax dollars.

Stop over reaching into municipalities.\n(2) if you don\u2019t like the gridlock follow the actual evidence: have ops work from home more days a week. Also more bike lanes more public transit and more dense housing (another bill recently rejected to convert office space to housing would have improved your daily commute to queens park)\nWhere do bikes go when not in their\nLane?

Bike lanes clearly reduce gridlock, as they remove bikes from lanes, clearing them for cars moving at a higher speed. That isn\u2019t even touching on the important issue: the death of cyclists on our streets where they are not given space. In London Ontario, Hamilton road has killed many bikers in recent years, due to an ineffective mix of car traffic, parked cars, and cyclists travelling a main thoroughfare.

The fact of the matter is this bill will INCREASE the volume of traffic and DECREASE the speed at which vehicles will be able to move on this road.\n-people do use cycling as transportation. removing bike lanes will mean that people will cycle in mixed traffic with vehicle. this will effectively slow down people driving vehicles, because of the differential in speed between vehicles and cycling when starting and stopping and navigating intersections, etc.\n-there is a very basic traffic engineering concept: induced demand: adding a vehicle lane will induce INCREASED demand for space for vehicles. any perceived improvement in the speed of traffic will be temporary if at all.\n-moreover the improvement of \"traffic flow\"  will be negligible at best. however, the change in the safety of all road users WILL be negative. the safety of people cycling will be negative, there will be an increase in injuries and death.\nI urge you not to support a bill that will\n-increase injuries and death\n-be very expensive\n-will make traffic slower and less safe for both people driving vehicles and people cycling\n"

        "comment": "Why is 413 included in this proposal on cycling infrastructure? This should be a separate bill.\nSecond, this proposal on cycling lanes is preposterous. My tax dollars should not be spent undoing work that makes communities safer.\nWe need this money invested in health care.\nAs both a driver and a cyclist I understand how important both modes of transport infrastructure are.\nI have lived and commuted in Toronto and Kitchener by bike and by car for the last 10 years and found cycling to be a much more enjoyable way to get around. Other drivers should be happy; one less vehicle on the road.\nI have also been in a pretty bad accident on Spadina due to painted line unprotected bike lanes. We were in the right track, but your proposal, Doug, is going to see more injury and deaths of cyclists.\nWith 22,000 people visiting \"The Well\" at Front/Spadina every day, and 11,000 residents there, it is simply required to have an alternative method of transport to get to this location. This is just one example of a development that was built with the expectation residents and visitors would not own or use cars.\nIf you want to sort out gridlock, perhaps tax the Gardiner and use that money on go train service.\nOr reduce parking on Bloor.\nAnd back to the 413; this highway or not required. Subsidize the 407, is would be cheaper.\nI understand I'm speaking to a brick wall here, but your ideas and projects are not \"for the people\". The people want better healthcare, lower mortgage and rent, a strong economy, and less government interference. Spending money on removing bike lanes; building an unnecessary highway; and dropping millions to tear up and agreement to have alcohol in gas stations a few months before it could happen for free.\nYou are ruining Ontario, my friend.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 is a dangerously regressive piece of legislation masquerading as a solution to traffic congestion. In reality, it's an assault on evidence-based urban planning, environmental protection, and local democracy.\nThe provincial government's heavy-handed intervention in municipal bike lane decisions is nothing short of authoritarian overreach. This blatant power grab undermines years of careful local planning, community consultation, and democratic process. It's particularly galling considering that municipalities are legally empowered to make these decisions under the Municipal Act.\nThe Act's fundamental premise - that more car lanes reduce congestion - flies in the face of decades of transportation research. The concept of induced demand isn't merely a theory; it's a proven phenomenon witnessed globally. By ignoring this evidence, the government demonstrates either willful ignorance or deliberate disregard for scientific consensus.\nThe planned removal of Toronto's bike lanes is particularly shortsighted and harmful. These lanes serve thousands daily and have demonstrably boosted local business revenue - facts the government seems determined to ignore. This isn't just bad policy; it's actively harmful to urban communities and local economies.\nThe environmental implications are even more alarming. The reckless exemption of Highway 413 from environmental assessments is an environmental catastrophe waiting to happen. This isn't merely cutting red tape - it's cutting essential safeguards for irreplaceable ecosystems. Once paved over, these vital carbon sinks and natural habitats are lost forever.\nThe timing of this bill, amid a climate crisis and rising urban transportation challenges, is particularly tone-deaf. Instead of embracing modern, sustainable solutions, the government is doubling down on failed 1950s-era car-centric policies that have proven disastrous for cities worldwide.\nThe absence of expert consultation in drafting this bill is glaring. It appears to have been crafted to satisfy political objectives rather than address real transportation needs. The result is a piece of legislation that not only fails to solve congestion but actively works against public health, safety, and environmental protection.\nMost disturbingly, the bill reveals a troubling pattern of governance that prioritizes short-term political gains over long-term public good. It's a direct attack on sustainable urban planning, environmental protection, and municipal autonomy.\nThis isn't just flawed legislation - it's a dangerous step backward that threatens to lock Ontario into unsustainable, unsafe, and inefficient transportation patterns for generations to come. The bill should be scrapped entirely and replaced with evidence-based policies that actually serve the public interest rather than political expediency.\n"

        "comment": "The stated, abstract objective of this Act is to reduce \u201cgridlock,\u201d using means which are proven to be not only ineffective, but also detrimental to public health and safety, mobility and access to Ontario communities for all people, environmental protection, and will aid in worsening the ongoing climate emergency.\nDespite having the authority to do so per the Municipal Act, requiring provincial approval for construction of new bike lanes where they \u201creplace a lane of traffic\u201d is a dramatic overreach of government authority in the affairs of municipalities. This is meddlesome and suggests the provincial government doesn\u2019t have faith or trust in municipalities to manage their own affairs, and further suggests that the provincial government isn\u2019t interested in local democracy\u2014bike lanes aren\u2019t constructed without warning; they are built only after an extensive planning process, which includes considerable research and community input.\nFurthermore, it is an objective fact that more car lanes will not reduce traffic congestion: the concept of Induced Demand indicates that with more car lanes, there is more traffic. This phenomenon has been observed all over the world. If this government were serious about \u201creducing gridlock,\u201d it would be making investments to the tune of several billion dollars to prioritize development and construction of extensive transit projects all over the province, and would invest considerable time, money and effort into the construction of more, comprehensive cycling networks. One more bike on the road is one less car; bikes take up far less space on the road than a single occupancy vehicle, thereby making more room for those who are or who must drive.\nIt is important to mention as well that the three bike lanes Premier Ford has pledged to remove in Toronto also see thousands of users per day\u2014that\u2019s literally thousands of cars that are off the road as a result. Local businesses are more successful in areas with bike lanes (this is easily proven looking at the Bloor Bike Lane reports prepared by City staff in Toronto), and various Toronto BIAs have already come out in support of bike lanes and the detrimental impact their removal would have on local businesses.\nCycling is also the far healthier option: physical activity leads to better health outcomes which leads to less money required for healthcare services.\nInstallation of bike lanes also have the added advantage of making the entire streetscape safer to use for all mobility modes; cars, bikes, pedestrians, and all others. Their existence can save the lives of cyclists and many others. Six cyclists have died on Toronto streets this year, and that is six too many; innocent lives lost because the victims were trying to get across town. Utterly senseless, with families shattered as a result.\nPertaining to bike lanes, my final comment is that the existence of these lanes gives all people greater access to their municipality. Those without the financial means to own a car, pay for insurance, parking, gas, etc. are more able to traverse their municipality for work, recreation, and to support the local economy. A car-centric community is a community that closes itself off to a considerable portion of its population.\nOn the topic of exempting 413 lands from environmental assessments, this is yet another short-sighted policy that will result in disastrous outcomes for the environment. The area where the highway is intended to be built is environmentally sensitive land. Once paved over, that land is lost as a carbon sink, a natural habitat for native flora and fauna, and as a floodplain/natural flood control measure\u2014forever. The proposal that this highway should be exempted from any environmental assessment to expedite development suggests the government doesn\u2019t care whatsoever about the environment and, again, is not serious about eliminating gridlock: as mentioned above, the concept of induced demand means that on completion, it will create more gridlock and spew more harmful greenhouses gas emissions into the atmosphere. Here, again, I must emphasize that if the government is serious about reducing gridlock, the only way forward is to invest in and build a massive public transit infrastructure, and augment municipal streets with alternative means of mobility, such as bike lanes.\nI question whether any planners, environmentalists, engineers or any other credentialed experts were consulted at all in the creation of this bill.\nIn summary, Bill 212 is a backwards approach to \u201creducing\u201d gridlock which will have the complete opposite effect of its stated objective: gridlock will become worse, public safety will be worse, local economies will suffer, the environment will be senselessly, irreparably destroyed, and health outcomes for Ontarians will be worse, which will end up costing us more. This bill should not move forward.\n"
