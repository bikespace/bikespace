        "comment": "I no longer live in Toronto but this is not sound policy. This is very clearly a municipal issue, and a waste of provincial government resources that would be better served exploring other more pressing land-use issues over which Queens Park actually has jurisdiction. The arguments in support of removing these lanes are not based in evidence, but rather informed by a narrow consultation of a minority of stakeholders, bolstered by biases. This policy relies on magical thinking, to suggest a policy solution for urban transportation that does not align with a single other jurisdiction which could by any metric be seen as leading in this area (including for motorists).\n"

        "comment": "This bill is shockingly misguided, catering only to those who prioritize cars at the expense of everyone else. It pushes us back to car dependency instead of encouraging sustainable, active transportation. Removing bike lanes, especially on streets like Bloor and University, ignores the reality of urban life, where biking is a primary mode of transit for many. This bill seems designed for people who don\u2019t consider biking a valid form of transportation\u2014a mindset that\u2019s outdated, impractical, and harmful to the progress cities need to make toward healthier, more accessible streets for all.\n"

        "comment": "Fully support this legislation, and rolling-back some of the bike lanes that are causing immense traffic chaos (while being grossly underused at the same time!). Please, please, consider removing two dedicated lanes that are in DIRECT line with expressway egress, these are:\n1. Dundas Street East - the bridge over the Don Valley has dedicated bike lanes that have reduced traffic to a single lane each direction - yet meanwhile the streetcar is also using that traffic lane AND that lane provides access to the ramp to the DVP - needless to say, one left turner on to the DVP at rush hour (and there are thousands) hold up traffic and streetcars FOR MILES! All this for the odd bicycle that uses the dedicated lane.\n2. River Street - similarly this is also basically a ramp to the DVP located a bit further north, and also which used to be two lanes each direction (as was Bayview). It too has now a dedicated bicycle lane installed each direction leaving traffic to and from Bayview and DVP with a single lane that is backed up FOR MILES ALSO! All this again for the odd bicycle that uses these dedicated lanes.\nBoth of these bike lanes should be on the top of the list for removal as a traffic analysis will definitely confirm.\nThank you.\n"

        "comment": "The recent revision of this proposed bill makes it even worse: more dangerous for vulnerable Ontarians, will create worse gridlock, will hurt small businesses on these streets, will result in more needless deaths due to road violence, and will do little to nothing to improve congestion.\nFolks, Ontario's population is growing. We cannot keep doing things how they used to be done. If every new Ontarian in the next decade has a car, nobody will be able to get anywhere, ever. We need to make safe, friendly, sustainable alternatives so that everyone can get where they're going. More car lanes are not the solution and never will be - they can't handle the scale of growth.\nBike lanes on Bloor, Yonge and University keep me and my family safe every day. If the Premier prefers to have cyclists ride in lanes of traffic with cars, I would be honoured to ride my bike directly in front of his SUV at a leisurely 10-15 km/h for the next few weeks to show him just how much this proposal will improve traffic flow.  Please let me know.\n"

This addendum is NOT based on real information. You need to reconsider, this will negatively affect the safety of everyone using these streets and it will not improve traffic.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is criminal. It purposefully targets the most vulnerable citizens on the roads. This bill will result in increased injuries and death. It will not decrease congestion or gridlock, in fact, removing bike lanes will increase traffic. This is elementary knowledge on how traffic patterns work. The fact that the proponents of this bill don't even understand the basic concept of induced demand is worrisome, and reveals that we have imbeciles at the helm of the provincial government. For the sake of the lives of the citizens, for the sake of traffic congestion, for the sake of common sense, this bill CANNOT pass. Anyone that contributes to advancing this bill complicit, and should be personally sued as soon as the next death inevitably occurs.\nPS - to the current proponents who say the lanes can just be re-routed to secondary roads, have you ever looked at a map? What other alternative roads serve the same purpose?\nSincerely,\nA Toronto Local\nAn Ontario Resident\nA Canadian Citizen\n"

        "comment": "I am commenting specifically on the following excerpt from the EBR posting: \"The framework is proposed to require the province to remove sections of the Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue bike lanes in the City of Toronto.  Additional authorities to facilitate the removal of these lanes would also be included in the legislation including an exemption from the Environmental Assessment Act and the requirement for the City of Toronto to provide support to facilitate the removal of the bike lanes. \"\nThe existing bike lanes on Bloor Street, Yonge Street and University Avenue were approved by a majority of Toronto City Council following a rigorous process of technical study and public consultation. There is no justification for the province to step in and require them to be removed and doing so is undemocratic and a violation of the City's and Council's autonomy.\nThe fact that the government is proposing to exempt this regulation from the Environmental Assessment Act demonstrates that the government knows the removal of these bike lanes would not meet the current requirements for assessing the impacts of the removal of the bike lanes.\nThe fact that the government is specifically targeting these bike lanes, without having conducted any sort of evaluation of them or any other bike lanes, demonstrates that the government is making a decision with no rational justification.\nThis proposal is prime example of government overreach. If the government truly believes that these bike lanes have an impact that requires provincial intervention, then the province should follow its own legislation under the Environmental Assessment Act, or at least follow the criteria it is proposing to introduce for evaluating bike lanes.\nThis proposal, the speed of it, and the targeting of it, would only be appropriate if there was an imminent threat to public health and safety. The reality is that removing the bike lanes is a threat to public health and safety.\nSince the bike lanes were installed on Bloor Street between Runnymede and Aberfoyle, there are been ZERO serious or fatal collisions with motor vehicles. The number of vehicles speeding over the speed limit has been reduced. Emergency vehicle response times have gone up. Removing the bike lanes will reverse those improvements. People will be seriously injured and killed as a result of this government's actions.\nDo not pass this regulation. Bloor will be on your hands.\nAnd to the public servants who read this and help push it through, the blood is on your hands as well.\n"

        "comment": "Now confirming that the top 3 most used bike lanes on Yonge, Bloor, and University are planning to be removed, I urge the government to use common sense and re-think this harmful bill. Many studies have shown how bike lanes are not increasing gridlock. The fire department confirmed response times haven\u2019t increased, the hospital chiefs demonstrated the usefulness of the bike lanes in front of Hospital row, the Bloor Annex businesses have demonstrated how well these lanes help improve businesses.\nThe data is clear. Removing these bike lanes will only hurt businesses and endanger lives, without having any improvement on traffic. Are we trying to move people or just cars? How many people are you willing to kill in order to feel good about saving a dubious minute in a car? Removing on street parking for bike lanes instead would help traffic flow much better than the current state.\nI hope common sense prevails and we do not waste our tax dollars endangering lives and hurting businesses.\n"

        "comment": "I work at a University Avenue hospital and drive there every day. The brand new bike lanes are well designed and have increased the flow of cyclists. Indeed, there is still on street parking on the section between College and Dundas. If, for whatever reason you want to add back a lane, use the parking slots. But even that makes little rational sense as the road narrows naturally just south of Adelaide. That\u2019s where the traffic was and remains horrendous. Tearing out the new bike lanes will do nothing to improve flow and will waste yet more of our dollars. This is 2024. Visit Montreal or any European centre.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose the removal of bike lanes for several reasons:\n1. **Increased Traffic Congestion**: Bike lanes play a vital role in reducing the number of cars on the road by encouraging cycling. Removing them will likely lead to more vehicles, worsening congestion and commute times for everyone.\n2. **Safety Risks**: Bike lanes provide a safer environment for cyclists, significantly reducing the risk of accidents involving cars. Eliminating these lanes increases the likelihood of collisions, putting both cyclists and drivers at greater risk.\n3. **Environmental Impact**: Promoting cycling is essential for sustainability and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Removing bike lanes undermines these environmental goals and could lead to higher carbon footprints due to increased vehicle usage.\n4. **Public Health Concerns**: Bike lanes encourage physical activity and healthier lifestyles. Their removal discourages cycling, potentially leading to higher rates of health issues associated with sedentary living.\n5. **Community Well-being**: Bike lanes enhance urban livability and make cities more accessible. Removing them detracts from the quality of life for residents who rely on biking as a practical mode of transport.\nIn summary, I am against this proposal to remove bike lanes, as it undermines safety, health, and environmental sustainability while contributing to increased traffic congestion. It\u2019s essential to prioritize and expand cycling infrastructure for the benefit of all residents.\n"

        "comment": "I cannot stress enough how misguided this approach is to urban planning and how much more dangerous this will make the streets of Toronto for the people who rely on biking to get to their jobs, get groceries, or take their children to school. This will not improve congestion, it will increase emissions, it will make traffic worse, it will make driving more dangerous, and it will lead to more cyclists being hit and likely killed while trying to navigate their city. It is bad policy, it is petty and reckless, and I strongly urge the government to reconsider any plans it has for removing bike lanes from Toronto or any other city. This is not your jurisdiction. It is overreach, plain and simple.\n"

        "comment": "The investment in bike lanes on Yonge, Bloor and University Ave has already been made and has encouraged me and many others to begin cycling more regularly rather than taking a car with a single driver as the divided bike lanes are much safer than the previous infrastructure. Removing these bike lanes would only prompt more people to drive, promoting further congestion, and be a massive waste of taxpayer dollars - both the dollars invested to build the lanes and the ones needed to remove them and reinstall them somewhere else. This would be a huge disappointment from a government that claims to be fiscally responsible and \u201cfor the people\u201d.\n"
