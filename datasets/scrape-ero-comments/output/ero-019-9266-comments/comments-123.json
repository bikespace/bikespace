        "comment": "As a transportation planner for the City of Hamilton, I do not support this bill. There are endless studies and factual data that prove that increasing vehicle lanes do NOT increase traffic flow, but instead, increase congestion over time. Not only that, but adding cycling lanes and removing vehicle lanes lowers congestion by discouraging driving in leu of sustainable transportation such as biking and bussing. Please do not pass this. Cars have ruined North American cities and we have fought for years to increase sustainable transportation usage.\n"

        "comment": "Like many people in Toronto, I grew up driving everywhere from our family home in midtown (back when it took 15 mins to get anywhere).\nSince the pandemic however, my entire family (including my parents in their 60s) now use bikes as their primary transportation, owing to a protected bike lane that now connects us to the rest of the city. This bike lane takes at least 6 members of my family off the road, and offers great exercise and well being to all of us. There is also no faster way to get around, and this critical mass of bikers>more bike infrastructure>more bikers clearly has momentum - why would you seek to interrupt that momentum now? Just as we are going from 2-6 million city bike users and getting serious numbers of people out of their cars?\nAs a midtown kid, I can tell you the 90s are never returning, in my neighbourhood alone there are towers going up on every corner, with no parking per this govts policy change. All those people bike, streetcar and Uber (as they should).\nThere is no viable plan to densify which does not include bikes, scooters, public transportation and walkable streets.  It is time to move forward towards density and livable cities, there is no plausible path backward.\n"

        "comment": "The Ontario government is scrambling to solve traffic congestion by targeting a group who choose to travel in an environmentally and traffic-reducing responsible way: cyclists. Bike lanes are not the problem. In fact, they contribute to traffic reduction. If more separated and protected bike lanes were available, more people would abandon their cars - especially in light of the expenses involved in operating a car.\nDecisions around infrastructure is for municipalities to govern, not the province. The 400 series highways are a big traffic congestion issue and cyclists aren\u2019t even a part of that equation.\nGet the projects that are way behind schedule moving and get with the 21st century!\n"

        "comment": "This idea is fraught with falsehoods. This will NOT reduce gridlock. It is a step in the wrong direction. Cycling is preventative healthcare at its finest. Cycling is the most efficient way to combat poor air quality, reduce congestion, reduce noise. Ontario should look to being a world leader, not a toxic, car-centric province. This is despicable and obscene. For shame.\nStudies from around the world show bike lanes ease congestion, reduce emissions and are a boon to businesses.\n"

        "comment": "Not only is this a ridiculous waste of time, resources, and money by the provincial government but puts cyclists in Ontario at risk.\nThe premier has been using dangerous rhetoric towards cyclists and has been completely ignoring multiple studies that have come to the conclusion that the addition of a bike lane on a street does not worsen traffic. They also do not block vehicle lanes for emergency vehicles as the Toronto Fire chief has stated.\nThe provincial government should be focusing on ways to make people more comfortable using public transit, walking, or cycling in cities to discourage driving.\nOn top of lightening traffic, they reduce emmisioms and have been proven to give businesses an uptick in activity.\nI hope no more time is wasted on this absurd bill, there are 1000\u2019s of Ontario residents living on the streets and it disgusts me to see the province spending money to remove and fight municipalities on something that is a positive.\n"

The provincial government is not in the trenches and therefore should not get any say in what happens in municipal bike lane/traffic affairs.\nAn official sitting in rural Ontario looking at traffic reports has no place making decisions for people on the streets of Toronto.\nLeave municipal decisions to the people who live there.\nThis is egregious governmental overreach by the provincial government and is by no means in the best interest of those who live in a city.\n"

It raises money claiming to be used for \u201cactive transportation \u201c, which includes bike lanes, bike uses the money not to build them but rip them out!\n"

        "comment": "To say that accidents can worsen traffic congestion and impact the quality of life of Ontarians ignores the very real and very unnecessary growing number of cyclist and pedestrian deaths that occur because of the prioritization of motorized vehicles in this province. I live in Toronto and just last week a 20 yr old student in my neighborhood was struck and killed by a car. Our government should be prioritizing road safety for cyclists and pedestrians, not investing in the further widening of existing roads or construction of new pointless highways when toll highways like the 407 are under utilized as it is. Induced demand maybe means temporary congestion relief but long term increase in use, and there will never be enough lanes for motor vehicle traffic. Unless that lane is for public transportation or cycling it is rarely the best solution to a problem.\nPlease whoever is reading this comment just look up the \"One more lane bro\" meme.\n"

        "comment": "By reducing the alternatives to driving, removing bike lanes will increase the amount of cars on the road. Study after study shows the benefit of bike lanes. Bike lanes are extremely important for delivery services to get where they need to go because cars block up the road anyways.\nAs a secondary note, I would appreciate the province not interfering with our city. The bill is clearly directed towards Toronto which feels like an overreaching province meddling in municipal affairs. Transit is the clear alternative, no amount of car lanes will help cars get to where they need to go.\n"

Bike lanes allow for faster flow of more people than car lanes and are supported by urbanists, environmental advocates and BUSINESSES along bike routes. If the province is interested in reducing traffic and improving commute times, it should invest in solutions for taking cars OFF the road, like investing in BETTER PUBLIC TRANSIT.\nThis proposal is a blatant attempt to distract voters from the real problems we face in the province thanks to Doug Ford\u2019s mismanagement and corruption.\n"

        "comment": "I really disagree with this proposal. Bike networks are essential for safety, get people out of cars and into modes of transportation that keep them active and healthy, and create fewer harmful air pollutants and GHG emissions. I use several bike lanes that have required removal of a lane of traffic and I feel so much safer and willing to ride. Not only that, they are PACKED with cyclists, especially at rush hour. My biggest frustration with this proposal though is that adding bike lanes saves me time compared with any other mode of transportation in Toronto. Biking to work (30 mins) is much faster than transit or driving ( 4o minutes to over an hour). Lastly, this should be a local decision, based on knowledge of the local context and not up to the province.\n"
