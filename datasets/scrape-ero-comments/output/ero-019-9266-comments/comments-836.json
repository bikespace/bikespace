        "comment": "Ontario's **Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act**,\nwhich aims to improve transportation infrastructure and reduce traffic congestion, is a proposal that may sound promising on the surface, but upon closer examination, it reveals several flaws that could worsen the problem it seeks to address and ultimately lead to long-term negative consequences.\n### 1. **Overemphasis on Expanding Road Infrastructure**\nOne of the central components of the Act is the expansion of road networks and highways to alleviate gridlock. While this may seem like a direct solution to traffic problems, it fails to account for the well-established phenomenon of **induced demand**. This concept suggests that simply building more roads encourages more people to drive, which can actually increase congestion in the long run. Rather than reducing gridlock, expanding infrastructure often leads to even worse traffic as more vehicles take advantage of the newly constructed lanes, quickly filling them up. This cycle of endless road expansion is not a sustainable solution and could ultimately lead to a \u201cbigger is worse\u201d situation.\n### 2. **Environmental Impact and Urban Sprawl**\nThe Act\u2019s focus on road-building and expanding highways also overlooks the environmental consequences of such projects. More roads lead to **greater carbon emissions**, which is a direct contradiction to Ontario\u2019s climate goals. The construction and maintenance of highways require significant energy and materials, and increased car usage contributes to air pollution and worsens the province's carbon footprint. Additionally, expanding highways encourages **urban sprawl**, as more land is developed for new housing, businesses, and industries along major roadways. This sprawl can diminish green spaces, harm ecosystems, and increase the pressure on municipal services in new suburban areas.\n### 3. **Neglecting Public Transit and Active Transportation**\nThe Act\u2019s focus on roads and highways overlooks the crucial role of **public transportation** and **active transportation** (e.g., walking and cycling) in solving gridlock. For Ontario to truly reduce traffic congestion and improve quality of life, the government needs to prioritize investments in **transit systems**, such as buses, subways, and commuter trains. Expanding these systems would provide Ontarians with viable alternatives to driving, reducing the overall number of vehicles on the road. The Act should also place a stronger emphasis on creating **safe cycling lanes** and pedestrian pathways to encourage active modes of transport. By neglecting these areas, the government is not addressing the underlying need for sustainable transportation solutions.\n### 4. **Lack of Focus on Congestion Pricing and Demand Management**\nInstead of simply building more roads, Ontario should explore solutions that manage traffic demand. Measures like **congestion pricing**, which charges vehicles to enter high-traffic areas during peak hours, have proven effective in cities around the world, such as London and New York. The Act misses this opportunity to implement more sophisticated strategies to reduce congestion in a way that encourages people to take public transit or adjust their travel habits. Without addressing demand management, the province risks continuing to support a car-dependent culture, which exacerbates gridlock rather than alleviating it.\n### 5. **Impact on Local Communities and Quality of Life**\nThe expansion of highways and road networks under this Act could have detrimental effects on local communities. New roads often pass through residential neighborhoods, leading to increased noise, pollution, and the disruption of local businesses. These communities may find themselves trapped between expanding highways and deteriorating environmental conditions, ultimately reducing their quality of life. Additionally, road expansion can lead to **displacement** of existing residents, particularly in underprivileged areas, who may be forced to relocate due to construction projects or gentrification driven by increased access to transportation corridors.\n### 6. **Missed Opportunity for Innovative Solutions**\nInstead of continuing with outdated and car-centric solutions, the Ontario government should be looking for more **innovative transportation alternatives**. This could include increasing investment in **shared mobility services** like carpooling, ride-hailing, and autonomous vehicles. There is also potential to integrate **smart traffic management systems** that can reduce congestion by optimizing traffic flow. These technologies are not given enough attention in the Act, which suggests the government is still focused on old models of transportation infrastructure that may no longer be the most effective in addressing modern challenges.\nConclusion\nWhile the **Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act** proposes a solution to Ontario's traffic problems, its heavy reliance on expanding road infrastructure and neglect of alternative transportation options are shortsighted and ineffective in the long run. The government\u2019s focus on road construction is likely to exacerbate traffic congestion, contribute to environmental degradation, and encourage urban sprawl. To truly solve Ontario's gridlock issues, the government should prioritize sustainable transportation solutions, such as investing in public transit, improving active transportation infrastructure, and adopting congestion pricing and demand management strategies. Without these measures, the Act risks perpetuating the very problems it intends to resolve.\n"

Canada, you are on a dangerous path of stupidity, greed and utter ineptness by your elected officials.  By making this leap, there is no longer any doubt that this society as we know it is falling to its death.  There is no escape.\nCanada has effectively reached the conclusion that more smoking will cure your lung cancer.  Cancer treatment will not.  And this is based on local science and I quote:  'It's just common sense'.\nWithout a care for the world, Canadians cling onto their cars, like the Americans to their guns.\nCongestulations Canada.

        "comment": "I use the bike lanes, and I know many others who do as well. I think that removing the bike lanes will likely be an ineffective method of reducing gridlock, because it is a well known phenomenon (by drivers and civil engineers I have spoken to) that when you open up a new road or highway, an increase in traffic is inevitable. I would suggest looking into re-timing the traffic lights in those areas instead, because it seems like a lot of the gridlock traffic is due to poorly-timed lights, where one is green, but the following one is red and nobody can go through, or you are stopped at a red light and can see the next one is green, but they don't change sequentially like they need to. Please look into re-timing the traffic lights to be more efficient to solve this issue. Thank you.\n"

        "comment": "I am against this proposal for the removal of bike lanes to create space for car lanes and for the provincial government to be involved in the creation of bike lanes as numerous studies have repeatedly shown that adding more car lanes and highways only increases gridlock and congestion. Many locations in our downtown cores have small businesses but little to no parking or limited capacity to host cars due to the city plan. These areas and their businesses are more easily accessible by public transportation and bikes which makes it more important to increase funding to public transport and increasing the infrastructure for dedicated safe bike lanes.\nIncreasing car lanes will only increase congestion and will have increasingly negative environmental and health consequences.\nOntario need high speed rail connecting more of Ontario to take cars out of roads and reduce car congestion from out of city commuters. Ontarians need higher frequency and more interconnected public transit systems to connect local residents to their neighbourhoods. Ontarians need more dedicated bike lanes for recreation and a more energizing commute. Bike lanes and public transportation systems are more beneficial to our health and happiness on an individual, municipal and global level.\n"

        "comment": "The proposed removal of bike lanes is one that is not based on evidence and will end up with more dead cyclists on our streets. The reasoning behind the removal is flawed, as even the government\u2019s own reports say that removing bike lanes will not improve car traffic flow. It will also make these streets less pleasant to be on and will cause businesses to suffer (see the Annex BIA\u2019s analysis of the damage businesses will endure if the bike lanes are torn out). Cities all over the world (including Montreal) are building bike lanes throughout their cities and doing all they can to encourage alternatives to the car, which is the only evidence-based way to improve traffic flow.\nI do not own a car and use these streets every day to get to work and live my life. Please don\u2019t make my communities worse by tearing up bike lanes that have been a huge success. Cities should not just be places some cars can drive through quickly and dangerously. It should be a place for people to live, like me.\nLastly, removing bike lanes forces cyclists, including Uber Eats riders, to share the road with heavy traffic, which many will avoid by moving to sidewalks. This creates a significant safety hazard for pedestrians, especially with powered bikes traveling at high speeds. Sidewalks are meant to be safe spaces for people walking, and an influx of cyclists will make them more dangerous and chaotic, particularly for those who are vulnerable. Bike lanes help keep everyone in their proper space, reducing conflicts and protecting both cyclists and pedestrians.\nThank you,\nMelissa\n"

You are moving cities backwards while the rest of the world tries to promote environmentally friendly modes of transport and creates infrastructure to support this.\nWhen these lanes aren\u2019t there as bike lanes there are parked cars.\nYou will have blood on your hands with the huge increase in cyclist deaths.\n"
