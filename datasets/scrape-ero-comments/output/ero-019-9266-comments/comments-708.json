        "comment": "Please keep the bike lanes. I live in the east end (Vic Park and Danforth) and commute daily to work in the core. I commute all year by bike, until there's heavy snow or ice and as soon as it's just above zero, I'm back out there. I take the Danforth bike lanes into the city and use the Bloor bike lanes everyday. I work in the 'upper core' and use either Bay's shared bike area or Queen's Park bike lanes to get their safely.\nRedirecting the bikes off of main arteries would expose me to more danger by having to cross at side streets where there are no lights at major roadways. I can't how many times I probably would've experienced serious injured by careless drivers if the bike lanes weren't there.\nI know this probably isn't going to do much good, but I can't stress how helpful and safe the bike lanes are for riders.\nFrom a family perspective, my son and I explore the city using the bike lanes. We've been all over on the weekends. Taking them away would be a shame, not just for me but for my family and the community at large.\nPlease keep the bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "Cycling is an essential part of living in a large city. It is one of the lowest cost forms of transportation. I ride in the city, and along the routes in question multiple times per week and I also did so before the lanes were installed on university and bloor. The infrastructure the city has installed is world class. It brings safety to cycling in the city and safe infrastructure is proven to increase ridership. This form of transport improves health, builds community, doesn't pollute, and is faster than driving during rush hour. It was faster 10 years ago before the lanes and it still is today.\nWorld class cities are shifting their modal split to reduce car use because cars take up too much room to park when not in use. It creates issues beyond congestion. Toronto has already changed bylaws to eliminate parking minimums and has set aggressive targets for bicycle infrastructure to encourage this type of transportation. It is a healthy choice, financially responsible choice, and fun!\nThe province should not be intervening in municipal matters to this extent. Each municipality is unique and we did not elect a premiere to make local level decisions. There is enough to be working on improving in this province and it is wasteful and disheartening to be spending millions to undo changes and create waste to decrease liveability in the city of Toronto and hold back other municipalities from advancing infrastructure that matters to their constituents.\n"

A complete disregard for the the city and its residents.\nIt took decades of work to have bike lanes put in on Bloor, and now there is a legal proposal to have them removed.\nThis shows that this government has no interest in the people who actually have to live in the city that the government runs out of city.\nOne of the few good arguments for Toronto separating from the province.\nIf the province goes ahead with this, people should continue to repaint the lanes until the law is changed back.\nLifelong resident and professional in the city.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose this bill.\nThis bill undermines the freedom and autonomy of municipalities in deciding how to organize their traffic and implement traffic calming measures. The province should not interfere with local decisions regarding internal roads and bike lanes, as municipal governments have a better understanding of the needs of their taxpayers.\nThe bike lanes that have already been established were funded with municipal tax dollars. Removing these bike lanes will incur significant costs to provincial taxpayers. Is it fair for people in small rural towns to fund the removal of bike lanes in cities like Toronto?\nMany people who currently commute by bike or other forms of alternative transportation will now be forced to drive, taking up more space on the road. The province should be encouraging the use of alternative transportation options\u2014such as bikes, electric bikes, and scooters\u2014on bike lanes to reduce car traffic and congestion.\nI also suggest adding a provision to clear bike lanes during the winter, to make biking to work more feasible. This would provide people with the freedom to choose between driving or biking, while also freeing up road space for those who truly need to drive. We should not force people who could bike back into cars, further congesting our roads.\nBike lanes provide a safer way for both adults and children to commute by bike, as opposed to riding in traffic where cyclists can slow down cars and face safety risks. With bike lanes, drivers don\u2019t have to worry about avoiding cyclists, and cyclists don\u2019t have to worry about being hit by cars.\n"

The future of transportation in Ontario, should not be highways, nor car-centric. There is a need for some highways but growth should come in the form of more sustainable transit. I also do not support the proposed power that this Bill would give over property owners and municipal government. The traffic of a city should be managed at a municipal scale.\n"

        "comment": "This is a poorly planned move. There should be concrete plans for all road users, not just a plan for cars and a promise the rest will come later. About 10% of trips ending downtown are by bike. Driving is not a majority form of transportation, it is surpassed by active and public transit combined. Any plan to improve road usage needs to have the interests of all road users in mind. Active forms of transit are part of a healthy lifestyle and numerous knock on effects in the lives of Torontonians and in our communities. They are also the most vulnerable road users and all decisions should be grounded in safety first.\nIf there are problems with current bike lanes, real or perceived, work with the city to improve them. And talk with cities about what they would like in a provincial framework.  But don't go demanding lanes are removed without that concrete plan for those impacted cyclists.\nI cycle for most trips, ride transit, walk and occasionally drive. I often try to find residential cycling routes whenever possible, but having direct, arterial bike routes are a necessary part of the equation for cycling further distances, and when travelling to destinations along those routes.\nOften there is little to no improvement in travel times by adding more lanes for cars. When you build roadways and degrade other forms of transit, more people with drive, and the new lanes will fill up again. So the end result is just more people sitting in more lanes of gridlock. Build transit and build bike lanes, because the more people that use those, the less drivers there are. If you really want to improve travel times by car, make decisions that make it cheaper, safer and more convenient to leave the car at home. The less drivers on the road, the better the experience for those that still choose to drive, as well as everyone else.\n"

        "comment": "So many people throughout the city rely on bike lanes to be able to commute safely. Removing the bike lanes will only add to the amount of cyclists that will be on roadways - putting them at more risk. Biking is an encouraged form of transportation throughout the city - as it should be - and how are cyclists supposed to feel having to bike on roadways where cars become aggressive because a cyclist is \u201cin the way\u201d when the cyclist is simply using the roads? Removing the bike lanes will take up so much time and money in construction - also meaning road closures (traffic!!) for vehicles! We live in a large city, traffic will never go away. taking away a bike lane on a major roadway is only going to cause cyclists to feel more unsafe while sharing the roads with impatient drivers. Please think of the people who rely on these bike lanes and not just of the drivers who will inevitably have to deal with traffic in one area or another due to the fact that we live in a city.\n"

        "comment": "I oppose the proposal for Bill 212, and I say this as someone who drives for 90 minutes every weekday. The worst of the gridlock I experience is on 400 series highways. None of these highways have bike lanes, but almost all of them have half a dozen express and collector lanes in each direction.  Many of these highways, such as the 401 between Milton and Mississauga have undergone recent widening projects. Gridlock persists without fail, despite these widening efforts. Adding more lanes invites more drivers, which in turn creates traffic jams. As Ontarians, we need effective alternatives to being stuck behind the wheel.\nCity streets should be safe for everyone, not just drivers. Cyclists should not be forced into significantly longer routes, or ride on unsafe roads so that drivers can have a marginally more convenient commute. Many Ontarians rely on dedicated cycling infrastructure for protection while going about their daily lives. Bikes require very little space for parking, unlike cars, which often occupy entire lanes while sitting empty. The issue of gridlock will not be solved by adding more lanes to the finite space of a street, it will be solved by adding safe, effective alternatives to driving. If there is a safe way to go somewhere by bike, or a public transit option, I will take it. That means one less car on the road, and one less car contributing to gridlock. Cycling is a fast, efficient, cheap, and convenient mode of transportation and should be prioritized accordingly.\n"

        "comment": "As a citizen, voter and taxpayer I write to express my concern for \u201cBill 212 - Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024 - Framework for bike lanes that require removal of a traffic lane\u201d. Today I would like to address the requirement that the province removes sections of the Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue bike lanes in the City of Toronto and more generally the idea that reducing bike lanes will improve commuting in Toronto.  I believe the proposed changes would negatively impact my community and there is little evidence to support the idea that this initiative will, in turn, proportionately improve gridlock in the City of Toronto.\nRemoval of bike lanes will reduce road safety and encourage even more congestion:\nI am fortunate to have access to both a car and bike to commute and often opt out of using my car in favour of biking. By removing bike lanes, I will be more inclined to drive due to safety concerns, and this will only further congestion in the downtown core. Similarly, my partner enjoys biking but is scared to bike on Toronto roads and will only bike when bike lanes are present. Removal of bike lanes will mean she will have to rely on other transportation to commute.\nThis sentiment is in line with research that has shown that having more lanes for cars can increase congestion. Additionally, construction from the removal of the bike lanes will also only add to commute times and traffic. Cycling lanes increase safety for all road users. By removing these lanes, travelling around Toronto becomes more dangerous for everyone.\nBiking is an important mode of transportation in Toronto:\nAs a lifelong Torontonian I have witnessed firsthand the importance of biking to the city. Over the years I have seen the growth of biking clubs and have had co-workers and friends who regularly use Toronto bike lanes to commute to work, for recreation and to run errands. To say that bike lanes are not a critical piece of infrastructure is a mistake and not creditably supported.\nThe Honorable Prabmeet Sakaria recently stated that \u201conly 1.2 % of people in the city commute by bicycle\u201d. However, this figure from the Statistics Canada Census is concerning the population of the Toronto Census Metropolitan Area and is therefore misleading. Furthermore, Bike Share Toronto  has seen ever-increasing demand in recent years and 2024 is set to see its ridership expand to 6 million trips by the end of the year, nearly nine times the demand seen in 2015. This highlights the ongoing and increasing demand for biking as a mode of transportation and the need for infrastructure to support it.\nRemoving bike lanes is a waste of taxpayer money:\nThe City of Toronto bike lanes that have been constructed in recent years. Even if this figure is an overestimate as the province purports, it is in addition to a lost investment of $27 million in city costs to install the existing infrastructure. As a taxpayer, I have to question the validity of investing in this project without evidence that bike lane removal will help congestion.\nI strongly believe that regulations that require the removal of bike lanes or prevent the construction of municipally approved bike lanes are misguided and an overreach. Thank you for taking the time to read through this letter. I hope that you will carefully consider the perspectives I have highlighted and work to address my concerns.\n"

Thus adding not reducing vehicle drivers journey times. If your goal truly is to improve travel times, there are many other easy and inexpensive solutions available.\n"

        "comment": "Aside from this being a smokescreen for other broader proposals in this Bill, I will restrict my comments to the Issue of Toronto Bike Lanes.\nThis is a matter of equity, safety, environment and economics.\n1) I see riders in these bikelanes that would not be biking to these destinations without lanes.  Parents with Children, Seniors, and New Canadians.  This is an equity issue for the large percentage of Ontario (Toronto) residents who cannot drive for some reason.  Their access to these routes is only through cycling.\n2) The protected bike lanes have been shown to improve safety for Pedestrians, Cyclists and drivers.  There is peer-reviewed research to support this position.  The Ontario Road Safety Annual Report 2021 indicates that there were 3.45 fatalities per 100,000 population in Ontario in that year.  My riding of Etobicoke Lakeshore has c140,000 residents so we can expect nearly 5 deaths per year in this riding.  How long until one is caused by removal of these lanes.\n3) Bike Lanes are good for business and business communities.  The Bloor-Annex BIA has attested to this.  Complaints of Lost parking in the Kingsway are spurious at best.  Only a portion of street parking has been removed and the vast majority of parking in this BIA is OFF-STREET (357 directly behind Bloor facing businesses.  GreenP Lots 500 - 505)\n"

        "comment": "I help reduce gridlock by trying to drive a car only when needed and instead riding a bike when possible or taking public transit. Bike lanes help me to feel safe doing this. It is such a giant step backwards on dealing with the climate crisis to actually remove bike lanes to make driving easier. All the bike lanes under consideration currently for removal are sitting above subway lines--we need to encourage people to get out of their cars and take public transit or bike especially along these routes where the subway already exists! Public transit and bike lanes should be prioritized! We need to spend public funds on transit, more bike lanes and alternatives that encourage people to get out of their cars. Electric cars are not the answer to the climate crisis as it would require too much mining on often traditional Indigenous lands to produce the metals needed for everyone to have an electric car. We need to invest in public transit and yes more bike lanes to make it easier to get out of cars. Learn more about the climate crisis to realize that we are in an emergency situation that requires a transformation in how we live, move around and what we eat. I don't want my municipal or provincial taxes going towards this regressive and irresponsible action that endangers our children's future even more so from climate change! Taking out these bike lanes is also a huge waste of public funds.\n"

Alternative transportation modes including cycling infrastructure are a viable way to reduce traffic congestion and improve local small businesses. This has been the case in every jurisdiction around the world including Toronto.\nThe government should work towards improving alternative forms of transportation not dismantling what is clearly working.\nThe inclusion of the dismantling of the cycle ways on Bloor St, Yonge St and University Avenue appear to be a personal attack rather based on facts.\nIt is vehicles that cause congestion not Bike ways. Remember that every bike is potentially one less vehicle on the road.\nThe government would be better served by improving Public Transit and actually completing projects that have tied up traffic and destroying local small businesses for over a decade.\nI urge you reconsider Bill 212.\n"
