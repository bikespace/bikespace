        "comment": "This is a terrible law and it is an illogical law when we are facing a climate crisis and need to reduce carbon emissions immediately. Encouraging cycling and discouraging individual motor vehicles makes sense rather than removing cycling lanes to make room for more cars!\nWith regard to the Bloor, Yonge and University lanes, those are some of the most convenient ways to move about Toronto. My daughter who lives in the Junction uses the Bloor bike lane almost every day to get to the U of T campus where she is a doctoral student. Students don't have a lot of extra money to spend on transportation such as cars and transit passes. This allows them to get exercise as well as a cheap and convenient way to move around the city. Cycling is also convenient to get exactly where you are going and makes use of the bike share network for those who don't own bikes.\nDedicated cycling lanes keep cyclists safe and allow cyclists to move with creating carbon emissions, the cause of global warming. The magic number is 1.5 C! If the planet warms above this, there is no going back. This is science! Encouraging more cycling, not less, should be happening at all levels of government. Taking away cycling lanes to allow for more cars just creates more emissions and more traffic. Some of those cyclists who won't feel safe anymore cycling without dedicated lanes will be using cars.  There is no getting around the fact that more cars equals more traffic...not less! It creates induced demand.\nAdditionally, cycling is good exercise. Many people are busy and don't have time to exercise each day. By riding to school, work or on errands, the exercise takes place automatically. Sadly, the province doesn't have enough doctors so keeping the citizens of Ontario physically and mentally healthy is important and exercise is one way to do this.\nI live in Ottawa and one of the reasons I moved into the city was so that I could walk and cycle rather than drive a car. I am very worried about the future of the planet and what will happen if we go over that tipping point of 1.5. I am conscious of my actions every day and how they might contribute to climate change. Because of bike lanes, especially the one on Percy St., O'Connor St. and Laurier Avenue, I am able to move safely in my city. Even though it is cold here in the winter, many cyclists use those bike lanes year round.\nI also volunteer with Ecology Ottawa and the acting director has summarized the reasons we need bike lanes on the Ecology Ottawa website which I have included as well as a CBC article which references studies which show the benefits of bike lanes with regard to reducing traffic.\nIn conclusion, our premier, Doug Ford, in 2017, was quoted as saying that bike lanes make cyclists feel safer. We need to keep our cycling lanes to allow Ontarians to move about their cities safely and to reduce car traffic and carbon emissions.\n"

        "comment": "Providing safe and convenient bike infrastructure is key to reducing road traffic by enabling more people to choose cycling over driving. Not only are cars far more dangerous and inefficient with space, they are environmentally disastrous and place an enormous cost burden on cities which need to maintain expensive car infrastructure. Removing bike lanes will not fix traffic, but rather induce more traffic as those who exercise a choice to bike will be forced to add cars to the road. In addition, preventing cycling significantly impacts the freedom of mobility for all citizens who cannot or choose not to drive for economic, health, or personal reasons. Bike infrastructure is a deeply local matter, and the provincial government should in no way have a say in removing or preventing cities from expanding this critical infrastructure, especially on the grounds of misguided and incorrect notions about traffic flow that are deeply rooted in classicism and elitism.\n"

        "comment": "Our provincial representatives have more than enough challenges to deal with at the moment. While inter-city concerns seem appropriate to manage, it\u2019s time to step back and recognize that citizens have elected municipal leaders to manage concerns within city boundaries. The ability to move around the city with ease should not be limited to those who elect to do so in an automobile. While many criticize that public transit, cycling paths, and sidewalks are underused in many areas of the city, that pattern would likely be reversed if proportionate spending was allocated to those car alternatives. Currently, pedestrian deaths are at an all time high due to careless or distracted drivers AND poorly designed intersections that favour speed for automobiles over safety for pedestrians. Similarly, many people avoid bicycle use not because it is a poor method of transportation, but because it is dangerous to drive in Ontario cities due to roadways that were (and continue to be) developed with cars in mind. Most major cities around the world are investing in car alternative solutions that are more people, community, and environment friendly. Some major cities are already limiting the number of cars permitted at any given time in city centres. It\u2019s time to look ahead and develop our cities with a new mindset. Put away ideas that were developed to grow the automotive sector rather than the quality of life of Canada\u2019s citizens. Countless studies have proven that the more roadways are expanded, the more cars fill them. My vote supports more bike lanes, more public transit investment, and more urban planning that prioritizes pedestrian mobility with better designed and safer streets. Either stay out of the game or start playing smart. Cars are A solution, not THE solution.\n"

While I currently drive more than cycle, I find that the bike lanes have improved my sense of safety as a driver and have had zero impact on my commute time.  We need to focus our resources on improving access to options that will benefit the fight against climate change, not encourage it.  Invest in finishing the Eglinton LRT, expand the bike lane system, invest in the TTC, bring adequate public transit to Scarborough.  The Premier should stay out of municipal politics\u2014this is simply distraction politics to divert attention away from the lack of investment in health care and education.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my concerns about Ontario Bill 212. While I appreciate the bill's intentions, I fear it may lead to unintended consequences for our community, particularly regarding environmental sustainability and transportation affordability.\nBiking promotes physical health, reduces traffic congestion, and lowers greenhouse gas emissions. It also enhances mental well-being and fosters social connections within our communities.\nIt's crucial that we prioritize policies that genuinely address the needs of Ontarians. I urge lawmakers to reconsider this bill and explore alternative solutions that better serve our community. Thank you for your attention.\n"

        "comment": "I think municipalities should be able to make decisions about transport infrastructure without the approval of provinces. It will slow down the ability of cities to make decisions about what is best for their residents.\nI bike on a daily basis for my commute and I believe more people would do the same if we had better biking infrastructure. Removing bike lines seems like step backwards to me.\nFurthermore, focusing solely on maximizing car throughout is shortsighted: security for all road users is also important, drivers, cyclists and pedestrians alike. Also, as a driver, I find it much safer and feel more comfortable when bikes have access to dedicated infrastructure and are off the road.\nCycling also maximizes our investment in public transportation as they are often used as a last-mile mode of transportation. I believe bike infrastructure is therefore a good economic investment.\n"

        "comment": "People who use University, Bloor, and Yonge have already had to endure months and sometimes years of construction to have these bike lanes built. Many of these sections are less than a year old, and now the province suggests they be torn up. How is this an effective use of taxpayer money?\nIf this plan is implemented, users of University, Bloor, and Yonge will have to endure years of additional construction. I hope the province compensates businesses on these streets for the negative impacts of additional construction.\n"

It would be insane to spend taxpayer money to remove them right after they have been installed. Perhaps instead we could instead focus on finishing the Eglington line, or filling in the thousands of potholes all over the city. Could we try not spending our money to destroy the thing we just spent money on?\n"

Spending money to remove bike lanes instead of building more is a horrific waste. I personally use those corridors quite a lot and it was a blast. It would definitely make my life, and the lives of many many other people much much more complicated. Apart from all the logical reasons of why this decision is just plain stupid in a nutshell, I feel like decisions like that are also putting Toronto and Canada as a whole mileage back. Such unnecessary, car-centric, not future-proof decisions make Canada and Canadian cities to look more and more like their big dumb American counterpart. Decisions like this will eventually make Canada a 51 state...\n"

I also saw others almost hit and then hit by cars on my way to work by bike.\nRemoving existing bike lanes, especially on bloor is going to increase the deaths and injuries of cyclists.\nIf traffic is a concern, then investment in real transit options (TTC), light rail, transit from suburbs would be more realistic to reduce car traffic on streets. People are taking the car because the existing transit options are poor or non existent.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal should not go forward as it eliminates some of the most used bike infrastructure in the City of Toronto. The argument that the usage of bike lines across the entire system being limited justifies the removal of bike infrastructure in the most important areas is downright wrong. If we look at the individual roads where it is proposed their bike lanes are to be removed, they have much greater usage compared to other bike lanes. Instead the city should further expand bike infrastructure so that there is an alternative to driving to remove the gridlock. If the system is expanded across the entire city, more people will see this as a viable option to getting around and car traffic can be reduced.\n"

        "comment": "As someone who uses multi modal transit on a regular basis (driving a car at least once a week, a motorcycle once or twice a week, bicycle 4-5 times a week, and public transit 4-5 times a week), the idea to enforce not just the oversight, but full on removal of bike lanes, at the provincial level is a broad overreach and should be left to the decision of cities and their councillors. With the legislation being targeted at Toronto (as evidenced by the removal portion of the bill) the city is much too dense to focus on car infrastructure, and reduces the city and country's ability to meet our our climate goals.\nUnless the Premier and MPP's wish to put their money where their mouth is, and actually fund subways to a proper degree, they need to step back and step off. (For comparison of funding, compare Singapore to Toronto since the groundbreaking of the York Spadina Subway Extension)\n"

People are still going to use bloor to ride their bikes, except this time they\u2019ll either have to take the lane and slow down cars, or ride right next to parked traffic and greatly increase their chance of getting hit and injured.

        "comment": "I must specify that removing bike lanes and returning them to cars is the literal dumbest and most backwards thing a city can do to fix traffic, because it will NOT fix traffic. All of those people on a bike will just get back into their cars, and since cars are bigger than bikes, you will have DRAMATICALLY reduced the overall capacity of the road. If you want to fix or even just ease congestion, then you must give drivers more alternatives to driving, which includes safe and protected bicycle lanes. Wanting to rip it all out is a huge disservice to cyclists and will cause an increase in travel time and road fatalities as cyclists will have less protections and space against cars. I really hope you all one day get on a bike and go on a tour around Downtown Toronto or even the suburbs to see the good and dangerous about cycling in Toronto and other major cities across Ontario, seriously, all of you should go on a ride through Toronto, see how nice it is and how fast you can get across the city on bike paths and lanes, then see how dangerous and scary it gets when that lane ends and you're stuck on a busy Yonge Street with no alternative routes because the \"Side Streets\" are never congruent with the arterials and is frankly disrespectful to cyclists to make them take the longer way around\n"
