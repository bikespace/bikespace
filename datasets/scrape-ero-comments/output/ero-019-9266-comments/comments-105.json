This proposal is the most braindead way that the Provence could be spending its time - fix the healthcare system, stop micromanaging bike lanes in Toronto! There is a municipal government for a reason!!\n"

        "comment": "I am a cyclist who cycles to/from work as well as to other destinations on a regular basis. Bike lanes are important infrastructure to increase the safety for cyclists as well as increasing the number of commuters compared to single occupancy vehicles. Prioritizing cars over public transit and cycling will be detrimental in the long run. Data from many countries have demonstrated that bike lanes do not cause congestion. In fact, cars are what cause congestion, and adding bike lanes and more public transit will lead to decreased congestion. I do not support this proposal for the province to have authority of when bike lanes can be implemented. Ontario should be focusing on how to expand transit and bike lanes instead.\n"

Even if a fence is put up, it is still full of exhaust.  Please invest in bike paths, but no more highways, especially not through environmentally sensitive areas.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is yet another ham fisted attempt by this incompetent provincial government to intervene and impede the sustainable growth of the cities in our province. There is no factual basis that increased lanes of traffic reduce congestion - they simply encourage more cars on the road which worsens congestion in the long term. We should be striving to increase to flow of people, not cars, in our cities. Cars are a horribly inefficient way to move people in a city, whereas biking and use of public transit should be encouraged. Increased bike lanes additionally promote healthy living, benefitting everyone in the healthcare system. Constricting these locally-led changes with frivolous red tape flies in the face of conservatism and municipal jurisdiction, and calls into question the utility of a costly ministry of red tape r\u00e9duction. End this nonsense NOW.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are a proven public safety measure that reduce accidents, improve traffic flow, and promote environmental sustainability. Studies show that dedicated cycling infrastructure significantly lowers the rate of accidents involving cyclists and motor vehicles. In cities where bike lanes are properly integrated, they also ease congestion by encouraging more people to cycle rather than drive, helping to reduce overall traffic. Furthermore, bike lanes promote public health by supporting active transportation and reducing pollution.\nThe Ontario government's push to remove bike lanes in Toronto, framing it as a measure against gridlock, is a clear example of prioritizing culture wars over public safety. This not only disregards the well-being of urban cyclists but undermines efforts to create safer, greener cities. Public infrastructure decisions should be guided by evidence and community needs, not political maneuvering. Shame on this government for putting ideology before the safety and health of its citizens.\n"

        "comment": "The provincial government should not be overstepping into municipal territory, and this is a massive waste of public resources, particularly in scenarios where labour has already been spent in implementing the new bike lanes.\nThey provide a safer alternative to personal travel and commuting, and studies have shown that cycling infrastructure can lower congestion in the long run, if there are more connections. See reference source.\nIf a lane needs to be saved, parking should be removed from major streets in order to create the space. We have too much street parking available that is taking up much more space than a cyclist who keeps moving. Particularly on major driving and transit corridors: King Street, Dundas, College, Bloor.\n"

It is important to have enough space to create a robust barrier between you and the traffic. I have already been hit by one car and had many others cut me off. If we don't invest in bike lanes there will always be too many cars on the road.\nBy the way, I also believe the Ontario government should stop poking its nose into the business of municipalities.\n"

The proposed measures will significantly increase pollution, degrade natural ecosystems, and contribute to climate change. Instead of advancing sustainable practices, this bill favors short-term economic interests over long-term environmental health. We must prioritize the protection of our planet, and Bill 212 takes us in the wrong direction. It is crucial that we reject this harmful legislation to preserve a livable future for all.\n"

        "comment": "This would increase not decrease car traffic, my data proves it.\nI live on yonge & can see the bike lanes from my balcony. I counted the amount of bikers and cars going through in an exactly 1 hour period on 8 different occasions, at different periods throughout the day.\nThe 2 bike lanes averaged 70% of the traffic going by car in the two car lanes. Since the two bike lanes are the same size as one car lane the bike lanes had a 40% increase in utilization per square foot.\nIf we took out the bike lanes many would choose to drive & it\u2019d likely increase traffic for cars.\nBike lanes are also the cheapest mode of transport to maintain per kilometer.\nI think the best solution is to steal from Europe, force new condo developments to have Green P parking at top floors of garages so we can move street parking underground opening up extra lane ways. This would also help combat the fact many new buildings don\u2019t have guest parking which has resulted in more street parking being filled.\n"

Bike lanes protect cyclists and pedestrians from cars and it is absolutely vital that we keep this critical infrastructure.\n"

If bike and pedestrian infrastructure causes those things to be more desirable and driving less so, GOOD, that's the point.\nCities should be for people, not cars. If any of our municipalities are competent enough to pursue anything on that agenda, which is already embarrassingly rare, the province should stay out of their way  at a minimum, and ideally support it, not worry about cars.\n"

The GO trains are FULL. The subways are FULL. During rush hour if these people drove cars there would be more than 5x the traffic. Improving service is the way to go, not building more highways and ruining public land in doing so.\n"

Isn't this outside provincial responsibilities? The funds and time you are spending in this matter and that would be spent on the removal of bike lanes could be used for more urgent matters such as healthcare, food insecurity, affordable housing.\nBy limiting the options of transportation you are affecting those who prefer to take care of their health, who use bike lanes a ways of transportation for their jobs, people who are scared to bike with traffic because of accidents. People who care about the environment. Tourism for the city and business for restaurants and other stores. People in low income who choose to bike because they can't afford to do otherwise.\nToronto is highly dense and removing an option such as biking will create more gridlocks as many would have to drive and return to old ways.\n"
