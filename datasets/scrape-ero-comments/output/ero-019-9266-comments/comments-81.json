        "comment": "The idea of removing bike lanes to help the flow of traffic is completely neanderthal thinking. Cars and parking create more traffic, not a small, protected lane that allows for speedy bicycles to pass through.\nThe success and growth of the Toronto city bike program should, to any reasonable member of parliament, prove the success and desire for the city of Toronto to have dedicated bikes lanes... That is on top of the studies that already prove that bikes do not add to traffic woes.\nI would suggest that the provincial government stop trying to make itself look good to rural voters by trampling on the authority of municipal governments and the desire of the citizens that actually live within it.\n"

        "comment": "The introduction of this Bill is an asinine use of taxpayer money and represents a gross overreach of provincial power. The province should not be micromanaging transportation issues on the municipal level which are confined to said municipality. Taxpayers do not want to see the conservative government squandering away time and resources to oversee bike lanes. These are issues which are meant to be addressed by municipal governments.\nBike lanes increase safety within the city and ensure that bikes DO NOT impede traffic. The suggestion to remove these bike lanes or impede their construction is counterintuitive. Without them, bikes will be in live lanes with cars and have the right to take up the full lane which will result in further delays with the addition of safety concerns.\nThe provinces time and taxpayer money is better spent addressing transportation issues which affect the province as a whole. Rather than micromanaging Toronto to \u201creduce\u201d the Premier's commute time.\n"

        "comment": "As a person who uses the bike lane often. Around 2-3 times a week, the increase amount of bike lanes over the past year has allowed and encouraged me to bike more often rather than using any other forms of transit especially the bloor and the university bike lanes. These new bike lanes are the ones that I use most often because they are the ones where provide protective route where I do not need to share the roads beside cars who are usually unaware of bikers around. Instead of reducing bike lanes, we should be increasing them especially full routes from end to end and not segmented lanes where bike lane ends at certain streets. They are still not fully utilize because many still see them as dangerous and unfriendly. Look at the increase stats of our bike share over the past year and it is not hard to agree that ridership have increased.\nPlease try to look at other cities like Montreal, New York, Amsterdam. The more bike lanes we have, the more people will be encourage to use them as they are much cheaper alternatives.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose Ontario\u2019s proposal to restrict municipalities from implementing bike lanes by requiring provincial approval. Bike lanes are critical to promoting safe, sustainable transportation, reducing carbon emissions, and improving public health. Removing existing lanes of traffic to build bike infrastructure helps reduce congestion by encouraging active commuting and reducing car dependency. Provincial oversight will only introduce delays, stifle local decision-making, and undermine climate goals. Municipalities should be empowered to build bike lanes that reflect their communities\u2019 needs and promote safer, more connected cities for all residents.\nThis is a ridiculous waste of my tax money, I want it to be used for things that benefit the population like investments into public health,  housing, and opening the public transit project that had been delayed for an entire decade.\n"

Their job is to arrange roads in a way that benefits ALL road users - that includes cyclists and pedestrians.  This proposal aims to remove the ability for municipal councilors to do their job and properly represent their voters.  Bike lanes encourage people to use bikes for their transportation needs which leads to less air pollution from cars, and healthier citizens.  If cities are putting in bike lanes it is because their citizens demand it.  Stop getting in the way of the will of the citizens of our cities and let municipal councilors do their job\n"

Look at any traffic study.\nI do not support this bill nor any government party that supports it. You do not have my vote. Bike lanes save lives. How dare you overreach.\n"

Removing bike lanes reduces the number of people biking due to dangers of sharing the road with the vehicles, forcing them to use vehicles \u2014 and more cars create more congestions.\nNot to mention the environmental benefits of biking (less CO2), health benefits (bikers are healthier -> less strain on the health system), infrastructure benefits (less damage to the road -> less upkeep)\nNot to mention the biking infrastructure is already built, and built recently \u2014 and removing it costs money.

I cannot fathom how this government plans to solve gridlock by introducing more cars on the road, especially as the region is growing rapidly. This bill will give people less options to move around and force more people into cars. This will make us a laughingstock around the world and cause long term damage to our infrastructure. I am severely disappointed in this toddler-like reaction.\n"

This will not help the city or the province. The city and the province should look at how Amsterdam treats cyclists and learn best practices.\nWouldn\u2019t hurt the MPPs and our Premier to bike once in a while to understand the benefits of cycling for health.\n"

        "comment": "I do not support this bill. Removing existing bicycle lanes is an enormous waste of taxpayer money which actively worsens commutes for many users. Forcing cyclists to use traffic lanes makes commutes more slower, more dangerous and more stressful for all parties. Bike lanes also have a higher capacity than car lanes, making them more scalable to high traffic without congestion. The most effective way to reduce car congestion is to have fewer cars on the road, which requires investments in public transit and active transportation infrastructure. Newly built cycling infrastructure such as University Avenue in Toronto can serve as a lesson for better urban road design in the future. Reconstructing newly built cycling infrastructure with no tangible benefit is an unacceptable and irresponsible waste of taxpayer money that could be used to fund meaningful improvements elsewhere.\n"

If you use common sense, the amount a space car takes is way more than the amount of space a bike takes. There are multiple bikes in a small bike lane vs the number of cars we can fit in the same lane. I suggest using some common sense.\n"

Yes, cities are the creature of the province, but I do not want MPPs from other parts of the province voting on infrastructure that they will ultimately never use\n- There is little to no evidence that bike lines are the cause of congestion. In fact, as detailed in a recent CBC article (which I've attached below), bike lines encourage a shift in modality that is much more efficient in terms of space taken. Yes, we get winters, but as we see in cities like Montreal, Canadians are willing to bike if the necessary infrastructure is there. And Toronto is much warmer than Montreal!\n- Bike lanes are important for the safety of cyclist. There are still too many cyclist which die every year on the roads of Toronto. Bike lines are an important way to improve the safety of all road users\n"

This legislation is being introduced because a tiny part upper class Torontonians are mad that they don't get exclusivity in one part of their lives. The rest of Ontario wants to address traffic congestion through a diverse approach (including but not limited to bike lanes) - nothing ever got better by having proposals sit on yet either committees agenda to approve, especially not one that isn't local. Local authority over local issues. If you disagree, just think of how you would feel if Thunder Bay made a decision about how your road was built in Toronto, doesn't feel so nice hey?\n"
