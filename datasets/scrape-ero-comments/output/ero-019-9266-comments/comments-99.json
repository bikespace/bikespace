        "comment": "There is absolutely no reason to do this, there is no real data to support the idea of bike lanes adding to gridlock. If anything, it's the opposite: the more safe, reliable options you give people to get around the city, the fewer people feel obligated to drive (thus reducing the number of cars on the road). The people in the city of Toronto do not want this and it is an egregious waste of funds that we could be using to solve the housing crisis and improving public transit. Safe cycling infrastructure is the key to solving the gridlock problem and helping to alleviate pollution caused by car traffic. Please focus your time, energy, and funds on what really matters: improving life for the citizens throughout the entire province of Ontario. In addition to my point above about bike lanes actually being a good thing for alleviating traffic, focusing on bike lanes like this is a massive waste of this province's resources and unfair to the residents who do not live in Toronto. Please use the money that would go towards the removal of bike lanes to support the needs of the communities outside of the GTA.\nSeriously, this is an incredible waste of taxpayer money. Conservatives are supposed to be the fiscally responsible party, but this is not that. Especially when many of these bike lanes are new, it makes no sense to remove them before they've had a chance to prove themselves. It's like pulling a baby out of preschool because you think they're not worth educating. It just doesn't make sense.\n"

        "comment": "I am wholly against this act, and opposed to removing any bike lanes. As a life long conservative voter, I am disappointed to see the government removing the best way to cut down congestion. I rely on these bike lanes every day to get to work safely and quickly. It\u2019s obvious to me that the current bike lanes in place cut down traffic because it allows people to use alternative ways to get to their destination. Removing them does not make any sense.\nAs a conservative I want LESS government intervention - I DO NOT want to province telling the city I live in how they should be run. If the government decides to remove bike lanes, I will be forced to support other parties in the upcoming election.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is an absolute gross overreach and abuse of provincial power. It is unhelpful, wasteful, and will produce more traffic congestion and accidents when cyclists like myself are forced to enter dangerous traffic instead of protected bike lanes. It will slow down traffic, not help. I\u2019m embarrassed by the Ontario government.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to the recently proposed legislation regarding the removal of installed bike lanes and the additional bureaucracy for installing new bike lanes in Ontario. This legislation is not data-driven and runs counter to evidence supporting active transportation options as vital to addressing traffic congestion and urban mobility challenges.\nBike lanes encourage alternative transportation, reduce car dependency, and ultimately alleviate traffic pressure on our roads. Removing them will only worsen congestion by forcing more cars onto already crowded streets, without addressing the root issue of over-reliance on cars. This approach does nothing to change transportation habits or create a more sustainable and efficient transportation system.\nInstead of making it more difficult to install bike lanes, I urge the government to invest in infrastructure that promotes active transportation, which is better for both our environment and public health. I hope the government reconsiders this legislation in light of the negative impact it could have on traffic flow, urban livability, and the overall well-being of our communities.\n"

        "comment": "The removal of bike lanes on Yonge, Bloor and University are all lanes that I use daily for my commute. Removing these will make my commute more dangerous. Also, apart from maybe killing me, an accident, which is more likely when I'm sharing the road with cars, will certainly cause more gridlock.\nThe worst gridlock is on the 400 series highways, which have plenty of lanes and no cyclists. If simply more car lanes isn't fixing the problem there, I'm not sure how it would on city roads. Removing bike lanes will not solve the traffic problem and will lead to more cyclists' deaths.\nThere is already ample contexts for people to express divergent views, vote, and make infrastructure decisions, that is through municipal politics. This law is not helpful oversight, but interference. Some politician elected from Windsor shouldn't be empowered to make decisions to remove cycling infrastructure in Toronto (paid for by the municipal tax base), which is what this law is really targeting.\n"

        "comment": "On the bike lanes thing: can we double down on Canadian e-bike manufacturing instead of removing bike lanes?  I can get from Etobicoke to downtown Toronto in 30 mins on an ebike without even breaking the speed limit, it's easy even in cold weather, and it's practically free.  Imagine selling millions of e-bikes manufactured in Canada.  It will create thousands of jobs and billions in profits.  Elderly people can ride e-tricycles - they even have ones with windshields.  Cheap, easy, fun, safe vehicles, all manufactured right here.  And it's all going to bring so much foot traffic to businesses.  Why can't we do that?\n"

        "comment": "As a resident of the St. Lawrence neighbourhood these bike lanes are critical for me to get around the city. It takes 40 minutes of using public transportation and 30 minutes to drive and find parking anywhere west of spadina or north of College for me. Many local businesses I purchase goods and services are in those areas. It is already almost as slow as walking unless I use my bicycle.\nIf I don\u2019t have that option to safely bicycle there I will not bother going to that area since it would be an inconvenience for me.\nWhy would the Ontario government choose to remove this much needed infrastructure? I pay tens of thousands in tax dollars to the city of Toronto and the Ontario government. Surely the best use for those tax dollars is to make it easier and more accessible across the city for MORE people, not less.\n"

A provincial process would make decisions without much of the relevant information.\n"

Even as a driver, keeping bikes separate means that drivers can continue at speed where they'd otherwise get caught behind the bike.\nTaking a little space for a bike lane gives drivers more road to have to themselves. It's the best option for everybody.\n"
