        "comment": "I am writing to express my concerns about the proposed Bill 212 which would give the provincial government a ludicrous amount of power over municipalities so that they could have final say on the installation of bike lanes in any community in the province.\nNot only is this a flagrant over-reach of the provincial goverment's purview in these matters, and also an obvious distraction from the more pressing matters in our province, even if it were being proposed with the best of intentions it would be a terrible idea.\nThe best way to get Ontarians where they need to go in most urban settings is to encourage them to get OUT of their cars and use public transit, ride shares, bicycling, or walking. If every Ontarian drove everywhere we need to go, traffic would be at a standstill and accidents and deaths would rise regardless of how many lanes were dedicated to cars -- this is true even in some more rural areas, but is especially true in cities and is definitely true in Toronto, where most of the vocal supporters of this from your government seem to live.\nThe provincial government could choose to spend their time, resources, and focus on bettering the quality of life for all Ontarians by fixing the broken healthcare system, looking into housing costs, building standards, and availability. If they wanted to fix specifically the way that Ontarians move around urban areas, they could easily focus on their own half-finished and half-funded public transit initiatives.\nPremier Ford himself could avoid needing to sit in traffic if the Eglinton Crosstown were completed.\nLeave the bike lanes alone, let municipalities focus on their own traffic management needs, and instead focus your energy on actual problems rather than insulting the intelligence of your constituents by parading around this non-problem.\n"

They should not be involved in the approval of local street infrastructure.\nThis is needless red tape being added that will slow down the much needed progress that is being made. They are too far from the actual locations to make real informed decisions and there are much more important issues for the provincial government to be focused on.\n"

Thinking only about car-based travel is inequitable and short-sighted. Creating a provincial bottleneck for the improvement of municipal infrastructure is the worst kind of big government, and will set us to the back of the pack when it comes to governments around the world moving forward for a greener and healthier future. Please abandon this idea.\n"

        "comment": "Ontario's transportation systems are so antiquated. We need more livable cities with less cars and more public transit which includes installing MORE bike lanes not removing them. The Ford government is intent on destroying everything that is good about this province through privatization, broken contracts, corrupt deals and lawsuits against Ontario's working class.\nFord has has decided to assign himself even more unchecked power by controlling how municipalities deal with their infrastructure issues when Ford can't even get the Eglinton LRT completed or improve public transit in general.\nFord insults Ontarians by refusing to answer questions about the numerous investigations into his corrupt governmental actions. The goverment has MONTHS off and seemingly no accountability to its citizens.\nI've never experienced a more wasteful, bloated, mismanaged, arrogant, unaccountable, corrupt and useless government so intent on destroying: healthcare, education, public services/spaces, environment, green spaces, transit, Ontario Place, Science Centre, LTC facilities and now bike lanes. Things that can improve the life of Ontarians.\nHey, but we have a penalty of over $200 million for a broken contract to get beer, wine and coolers in corner stores. Taxes are collected to collectively IMPROVE lives of Ontarians and their towns instead of squandering it on broken contracts, lawsuits.\nBuying votes by wasting an additional $2 billion on distributing $200 cheques when it could be spent on ANY of the above-mentioned initiatives should be criminal. Ford is only interested in improving his commute to his cottage and to work, whenever he decides to show up at Queen's Park, and in padding his wallet via taxpayers' money. Ford, his bloated and overpaid Cabinet, his cronies in the business community are the only ones benefiting from Ford's reign.\n"

        "comment": "I believe this policy is a misuse of time and resources for the province and should not go forward. Municipal roads that are the jurisdiction of the city should be left to the city to manage. As a provincial resident, I do not believe provincial officials should be spending time on activities outside of their jurisdiction. In addition, I believe that cycling is an efficient and effective mode of transportation and is most safely done when able to access dedicated bike lanes. If the program objective that this rule is aligned to is about reducing congestion and reducing accidents, the best way to do that is by reducing the number of vehicles on the road by creating safe alternatives for alternate modes of transport including bikes. And finally, I believe that if we are examining ways to make city streets less congested, the first priority should be to remove all street parking from arterial roads.\n"

Not because the bike lane exists, but because it was not properly used and because of a lack of respect for cyclists in this city. She is not alone. Cyclists are members of the community, who are trying to commute to school and to work safely. This bill would seriously endanger my life and that of my friends and family. The city should not be built for cars, but for the people who live there. If passed, Ford will be remembered as the Premier who cared more about the cars in this city than the lives of his constituents.\n"

Bike Share and bike lanes are an integral part of my commute. Accessible and timely transit plays a big part in that.

        "comment": "The proposed legislation is at best unnecessary and at worst, will significantly hinder the development of sustainable transportation networks in communities across Canada. Municipalities already conduct extensive studies and consultations before adding bike lanes. The provincial government is clearly adding red tape with proposed legislation which is entirely political in nature. The only thing that will help reduce gridlock and save everyone (not just people who drive) time is robust alternative transportation options. Adding bike lanes as part of well-designed and maintained networks will REDUCE the number of people who opt to drive (which they currently do because they don't have a safe bike route to do so). I am a driver, I do not own a bicycle, and I do not support this legislation.\n"

They are safety feature in the city and critical for people who actually live in the city to get around the city. We should be working to get people out of cars and on to the TTC or bikes. Removing bike lanes won't ease congestion, it'll just out more cars on the road and more pollution in the air. The money has also been spent on these bike lanes. The premier should focus on the province not individual cities. In actuality the premier should just step aside, the majority on Ontario does not want him and the other half is being bought off with \"rebates\"\n"

        "comment": "Key Points Against this Bill:\n- Provincial overreach into municipal affairs\n- Will not address the root cause of automobile congestion\n- Will increase government expenditures and bureaucracy\n- Politically expensive for no clear gains or improvements, especially in the long-term\nThis bill is regressive and deeply flawed. It is unclear how making bike lanes more challenging to build would effectively improve traffic flow, as the bottleneck for many roads is the intersections, rather than the vehicle lanes themselves. The only proven way to combat vehicle congestion is to provide VIABLE alternatives to automobiles, and this bill goes against that notion. Additionally, bicycle lanes are one of the most cost-effective ways to transport individuals, and has been shown to boost local businesses.\nIf bike lanes were to be removed, it would likely only worsen traffic, as the marginal gains in road capacity would be lost to the gain in drivers, who would be taking up significantly more road space. While the frustrations regarding vehicular traffic are understandable, using bicycle lanes as a scapegoat will not address the root cause of the problem -- the inefficient geometry of cars and vehicle infrastructure. These points aside, there are great political costs to pushing through this legislation. Firstly, it is a flagrant violation of municipalities wishes, as many of them see this as significant provincial overreach. These municipalities are far better suited to make local planning decisions than some provincial bureaucrats. Additionally, to check all proposed bike lanes will require expanding government bloat, which will be unpopular with many voters. Furthermore, this will turn bicycle users, safe street advocates, among other similar politically engaged groups against the PCs. While it is clear that this bill is more of a political manoeuvre than sensible transportation policy, the political gains are unclear at best, and harmful at worst. The government should abandon this bill, and try to foster a more well-rounded and holistic transportation planning approach, rather than being intentionally divisive in a bid to be re-elected.\n"

        "comment": "A completely wrongheaded direction. The steps proposed here contradict study based findings of the benefits of increasing and improving access to infrastructure, such as bike lanes. These include reduction of traffic congestion, reduced environmental impact, and significant health and safety benefits for cyclist. This groups include a large part of the population that cannot afford a motorized vehicle, and are forced onto the road by inadequate access to public transit. Expert opinion confirms that adding to existing motor ways will have the inverse effect of reducing traffic, and will actually worsen congestion. This proposal is regressive and will absolutely cause harm and loss of life. It has no basis in research or fact, and is nothing more than a naked effort of politicizing infrastructure in order to pander to a constituency opposed to its implementation.\n"

        "comment": "The problem is that you have a single passenger in cars, when carpooling and public transportation are viable options. Reducing the amount of cars means reducing gridlock.\nStudies have shown that dedicated bike lanes have actually improved traffic for businesses (good luck trying to find a parking spot for your car in downtown Toronto).\nAlso, look at New York City, specifically Manhattan. Even though they still have traffic issues, look at the shear amount of dedicated bike lanes and their vast network for bike share. Look at the reach and extent of their subway system. They put the parking spots between the bike lane and the car lanes. This means that they don't even have to put in dedicated barriers/protections for the bike lanes. The parked cars act as the barrier. This keeps infrastructure costs down and makes drivers aware (because who cares about hitting a cyclist, but if you ding your mirror on another car, drivers panic about insurance costs).\nIf I was going to get hit by something, I'd rather it being a bicycle than a mouth-frothing dad in a minivan speeding past a construction site because they had to drive their kids to school (their kids are too good for public transit, I guess).\nMaybe if more politicians and policy makers lived in the cities instead of multi-million, multi-acre mansions in the suburbs, they would have a different perspective on this matter. Have these folks bike one day in the city, have them navigate to Queen's Park or their office in downtown Toronto. And since you're proposing to remove bike lanes, make sure these politicians ride in the car lanes, with the other cars. Ask them how safe they feel during rush hour.\n"
