More people biking walking and taking transit mean less cars and less congestion. I voted for this conservative government. Your supposed to remove laws and regualtion. Quit over reaching and forcing your will on municipalities road design. Stop wasting tax dollars. Maybe finish the 400 to sudbury and care about the whole province and not just Toronto.\n"

        "comment": "Cars are the least efficient way to move people through cities. Nearly all major cities in North America and Europe are actively discouraging car use in their cities and increasing the use of bicycles and transit. We need to support the positive trend of cycling in this city so PEOPLE can move around the city quickly and easily. This also means the emergency services, senior transport, disabled transport and deliveries are prioritized because folks that can bike, do bike, freeing up space on the roads to get drivers moving.\nMore people cycling means more people not driving. This results in less congestion for drivers. Because I have protected bike lanes on my way to work - Bloor to University I drive far less. I don't emit when I drive, it's safer for pedestrians and it causes less externalities (noise and pollution). If you remove those bike lanes, me and my neighbours will be driving to work, guaranteeing more congestion.\nFinally, it's ironic how a conservative government is getting involved in a municipal issue. We just had a mayoral election and one candidate ran on an anti-bike lane agenda and lost handsomely so we already had a referendum on this issue. Let people who live, work and raise there families here exist without this constant harassment of our way of life.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal complicates the development of bike lanes, which can be a cost-effective solution to reduce traffic congestion and support environmental goals. Bike lanes provide a long-term return on investment by decreasing road maintenance costs, reducing fuel consumption, and promoting public health\u2014all of which ultimately save taxpayer money. Local governments are best suited to assess their own infrastructure needs and should not be burdened by additional bureaucracy that delays implementation.\nEncouraging alternative forms of transportation, such as cycling, helps relieve pressure on roadways, leading to smoother traffic flow for drivers and reducing the need for expensive highway expansions. Bike lanes also contribute to reducing pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, aligning with responsible environmental stewardship while preserving economic growth. Instead of stalling bike lane projects with provincial red tape, the government should promote local flexibility and support these initiatives, as they benefit both the environment and the economy.\n"

Quite simply, when you look at a map to your destination it\u2019s almost always the shortest option. Drivers seem to have a vendetta against cyclists in Toronto, I frequently find myself yelling \u201care you trying to kill me?\u201d Because nothing else seems to explain their driving behaviour and aggression towards cyclists in particular. Bike lanes at least give cyclists some level of protection.\n"

        "comment": "This legislation, with respect to bicycle lanes, is completely misguided and devoid of an evidentiary basis. Every single study shows: (1) bicycle lanes reduce congestion (not increase it); (2) bicycle lanes increase safety for all road users; and (3) bicycle lanes increase business activity where they are installed. The legislation is targeted at reducing congestion, but this legislation will have the complete opposite effect.\nPersonally, I live in Toronto (around St. Clair) and I cycle, walk, and I drive. I own a car and drive ~12,000 km/yr. In recent years, due to the increase in bicycle lanes, I have chosen to cycle most places as opposed to drive. I am one less car on the road due to the increase in cycling infrastructure. My main routes used are Bloor, University, and Harbord. If the bicycle lanes are removed or if the expansion plan in Toronto is disrupted, I, and many other cyclists, will instead drive. Alternatively, we will cycle in the middle of the traffic lane that is remaining, blocking all of the traffic (as is our right under the HTA given the narrow roads that make it unsafe to pass without separated lanes). This will significantly increase congestion beyond what it currently is. As you are aware, over 10,000 cyclists use the Bloor bike lanes every day. Over 6 million trips are made on Toronto's bike share alone, and as we know, 90% of people use their own bikes to bike around the city, so there are likely ~60 million cycle trips a year in the city of Toronto alone. Each of those trips account for at least some cars off of the road. Removing bike lanes will either (a) reduce demand for cycling and increase demand for driving, thereby significantly increasing traffic; or (b) require cyclists to take the whole lane (as opposed to the bike lane that was there) which will effectively reduce all of the main roads to a speed limit of 15-20 km/hr. If your goal is to reduce congestion, this will not do it. You must invest in transit, more bicycle infrastructure, and reduce demands for car use within the urban centres. I have no issue with driving (I am a driver myself!) but it should be reserved for necessities within urban centres (picking up groceries/large items, going long distances, etc.) it should not be the default mode of transportation. Indeed, as our population increases, without expropriating all of our houses, there will never be more traffic lanes on our roads. As more and more people move to the region, without alternatives, congestion will get worse and worse no matter what you do. The only solution is to increase alternatives (transit and cycling and walking), not give our limited space to the most inefficient means of getting around (cars). I implore you to speak to experts, as opposed to having a visceral reaction to something that is clearly more ideological than it is evidence-based.\nThe government says it wants \"common sense\" and evidence-based decision making. I implore you to read the significant studies the city did prior to installing the lanes, and to read all the traffic engineering studies done on this topic. The government is misguided and must not move forward with this legislation.\nAnother issue is the undemocratic nature of this legislation. As you are aware, Toronto specifically had an election where this was a major topic. The candidates who ran on anti-bike lane policies received the least amount of votes. The people of Toronto have voted on this issue, and to use the provincial powers to encroach on traditionally municipal issues (albeit, I understand that municipal powers are not protected by the Charter), is nonetheless undemocratic. Provinces have always respected municipal powers as an unwritten principle of law. This encroachment is undemocratic.\nI hope you will reconsider.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal shows a shocking level of ignorance at the realities of commuter transit options and impacts in cities like Toronto.\nStudy after study has proven the benefits of separated bike lanes from traffic reduction to individual safety. Cherry-picked instances in which an added bike lane might impact drivers some nominal amount on their commute is no reason to throw out the baby with the bathwater. Acting as though bike lanes are a significant factor in gridlock issues is treating an (arguable) symptom instead of a disease.\nThis proposal reads like the transparent political swing it is: a flashy wedge issue appealing to suburban and rural voters, fishing for their votes by putting real people's lives in real danger when our already shaky bike infrastructure is further dismantled.\nI own a car. I don't own a bike. I am already forced to drive more than I want to, rather than use a BikeShare, because many bike routes are already dangerous and under-maintained. So I become one more car clogging up the road. What do you think will happen if you continue to remove bike lanes? Just like adding another lane to a highway does not speed up traffic, the former bike lane will just fill up as well - in many cases with the same commuters now forced to drive instead of cycle, contributing to congestion, pollution, and accidents.\nThis isn't some experimental new concept Toronto is toying with. You can look to world-class cities the world over and see that they take a progressive stance toward this kind of multi-use infrastructure. I've been embarrassed by many of the regressive decisions this province has made, but this would be one of the worst.\n"

        "comment": "As someone who cycles to work in downtown Toronto year-round I have experienced first hand the increased level of safety, comfort, and ease that has come with the installation of bike lanes across the city over the past five years. More importantly, I know of many young families who commute via bicycle who take their children to day care or to school on their bikes and currently feel very safe to do so. I would hope that these bike lanes be protected for the safety of those who live in the neighbourhoods in Toronto, and to allow them to get around the city in a fast, affordable, and low-carbon manner.\nIt would be short sighted to remove existing bike lanes and to deny the installation of future bike as ridership is growing significantly every year.\nGiven the level of red tape and regulation already bogging down all infrastructure projects, I also believe it would be detrimental to mandate another level of approvals and data collection. We need to be moving in the opposite direction where we streamline regulation so things can actually get done in this city.\nI would also question what authority the province has over roads which are, as stated in the bill, municipally operated. The people of the city should be given autonomy over the roads and streets that we live on and use, and this should not be compromised for those who are visiting the city who are frustrated with traffic.\nPlease consider withdrawing this bill.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal puts cyclists, drivers and pedestrians at great risk of injury/death and liability. I bike everyday, including in the winter, with my family (2 small kids) as does my partner. I know at least 5 families that do the same. I cross the city daily from Regent Park to Liberty Village and back. I go to all our family activities in the city by bike. If I take the train, I take a bike to the train station. We even go up from Regent Park to Don Mills/Eglinton on the regular for classes. And we bike up to Markham/Richmond hill a few times a year. Please don't remove the bike lanes that make this a safer activity for us. Please don't make us loop around to find safe roads and bike lanes. Cyclists need direct routes that are protected/safe to make cycling feasible. It is not a hobby for many and is a way of commuting.\nBike lanes keep many people out of ubers, cars and transit. The more high quality, protected bike lanes we have, the more people will cycle to help with congestion. Otherwise, you will definitely have more people in Ubers and cars to add to congestion on the road, and more cars parked on the road, which will defeat the purpose of removing bike lanes since these lanes will still be blocked by parked cars.\n"
