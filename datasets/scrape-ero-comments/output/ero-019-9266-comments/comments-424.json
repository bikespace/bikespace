There was a cyclist who was crushed infront of me this summer on Bloor St. This should not be allowed, Doug Ford does not live downtown and or ride a bike.

Ontarions should be allowed to develop their local communities as best suites them.\nCycling is an essential transportation option for those who either cannot afford a car, unable to drive, or who choose to use a bike.\nThe safety of people outside of cars need to be considered. This bill sacrifices public safety in favor of maximizing motor vehicle throughput - which is at odds with acheiving safe and prosperous communities l.\nWhen I drive, I would much prefer cyclists have their own lane. Its frustrating when I want to pass them but cant. That said, they have a right to be there and is where they are supposed to be according to law.\nBike lanes support local businesses better than cars and boost public transportation.  Bike lanes are the infrastructure we need for today and our future.\n"

What a gross misuse of funds.\nBut more importantly, with this bill, the government is effectively saying that if you ride a bicycle, your life is worth less than those who drive, as it puts cyclists in danger. Everyone knows Toronto has a traffic problem, but instead of addressing the real causes, bikes always become the scapegoat. The fact that there's a chance that people may actually die and that the government is okay with taking that chance speaks volumes to where priorities are.\nVotes are seemingly more important than the lives of those who cast said votes.\n"

The problem is the Construction \ud83d\udea7 going on everywhere and the cars parked on both sides of the streets. Just think how many people died on their bike in the past years . Invest in more parking spaces for the cars instead. All the big cities in the world are making more bike lanes and our premier is pushing us back in time . By removing the bike lanes all of those people would be forced to use their cars instead and what\u2019s the result at the end More traffic congestion. Make Toronto of is the biggest bike friendly city in North America .

        "comment": "1 - A cyclist died this years on Bloor street. Removing cyclists lanes would increase the risk of fatal accidents. It should be improved to protected lanes instead.\n2 - Toronto is seeing an increase every years in City Bike users and new buildings offer more bike parking than car parking. The city should already prepare for the future increase in bike user instead of playing catch like the current housing situation or health care system for which Ford should focus on instead of over reaching for his personal gain in the city of Toronto.\n3 - Toronto voted for Olivia Chow, someone who made part of her mandate to improve multimodal transportation services. She knows better what the city needs.\n4 - University Ave just implemented the new bike lanes and removing them would be a waste of tax payers money that could be put to better use for school, health care or housing which are all in desperate need for funding.\n5 - For the more bike users the city have, the less car are on the road helping reduce traffic. It is also an environmental option.\n6 - Toronto has a larger population while the bike infrastructure currently lacks. Montreal in comparison has way more bike infrastructure and while the population is lower they still have more bike users. This proves that by increasing bike infrastructure it would increase the number of bike users. The opposite will just bring more car to those roads since some people will be scared of biking.\n"

        "comment": "I use the separated Bloor St West bike lane (between Dufferin and St George) for my daily commute to and from work. The bike lane provides me with a safe, efficient commuting option, and the ride is my principal source of exercise.\nI cannot afford daily parking downtown, so driving is not an option for me. While I use the subway to commute during inclement weather, it is not always reliable in my experience.\nPrior to the installation of the separated bike lane, I occasionally rode my bike on Bloor, but found it dangerous, and I expect it will become just as dangerous if the separated lane is removed. And unfortunately, there are no other end-to-end bike routes available for my commute.\nVery occasionally, I drive to work when I need to bring work materials with me. I have found no noticable difference in the driving time since the separated bike lane was installed on Bloor, although the separated lane has made commuting by bike much faster.\nI urge the Ministry to please keep the separated lane on Bloor.\n"

It\u2019s about time sage bike lanes were added. More and more people can now be safer on their daily commute. As a driver I haven\u2019t noticed an increase in traffic\u2026the increase in traffic is mainly due to all the construction projects. The removal of already built bike lanes is a horrible use of tax payers money! They will be costly to remove and I believe drivers in the city just need to learn how to co-exist with bikers on the road. We are a growing city and we heed the ability to have green forms of transportation rather than continuing to prioritize cars.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my concerns regarding the proposed removal of the bicycle lanes on Bloor Street. As a frequent user of these lanes, I believe their elimination would have serious negative implications for our community, local businesses, and the city as a whole.\nThe Bloor bicycle lanes have been instrumental in promoting safe and sustainable transportation. They provide a dedicated space for cyclists, reducing the risk of accidents and encouraging more residents to choose cycling as a viable mode of transport. This shift has contributed to decreased traffic congestion and aligns not only with the city\u2019s Vision Zero initiative to eliminate traffic fatalities, but also with the province\u2019s goals to improve traffic mobility.\nAdditionally, these lanes support local businesses by making the area more accessible to cyclists who might otherwise avoid congested streets. Studies in similar urban areas show that customers arriving by bike tend to shop more frequently and spend more time compared to those arriving by car. Removing the lanes would reduce the flow of cyclists, negatively impacting businesses that depend on this steady, sustainable traffic.\nFurthermore, these lanes make our neighbourhoods more accessible, allowing people of all ages to navigate the city safely. Removing them would discourage cycling, pushing more people back into cars, which would exacerbate existing traffic issues and reduce the number of customers stopping by local shops on their way.\nI urge you to reconsider this proposal and to prioritize the needs of cyclists and local businesses in our community. Maintaining the Bloor bicycle lanes is essential for fostering a safer, more sustainable, and economically vibrant urban environment.\nThank you for your attention to this important matter. I hope to see a commitment to preserving these vital lanes.\n"

If we want to eventually move to a city with the kind of environmental footprint that some storied European cities enjoy, and take our place in the world as a beacon of environmental hope during these times of climate change, we absolutely need to keep these bike lanes in place. As a driver, I don\u2019t see the bike lanes as detrimental to the flow of traffic. There are many other reasons that lead to gridlock in Toronto, but I firmly believe that the bike lanes are the least of these reasons. If it were up to me, I would strike down this bill immediately.

        "comment": "I strongly oppose to this government legislation that restricts the implementation and removal of bike lanes province-wide. This decision represents a troubling overreach of government power that could have severe long-term consequences on the health, livability, and sustainability of Ontario\u2019s cities.\nBike lanes play a vital role in creating accessible, balanced urban spaces where people can choose active and environmentally friendly forms of transportation. Removing them \u2013 or making the process to add or retain them unnecessarily difficult \u2013 places undue emphasis on car traffic, undermining decades of progress toward safer, more sustainable, and equitable cities.\nThis new restriction not only deprives municipalities of their autonomy but also disregards the preferences of communities that value safer, greener alternatives to car-dominated transit. By prioritizing motor vehicle traffic over cycling infrastructure, this act poses a real threat to the safety of cyclists and pedestrians, stifling efforts to reduce emissions, address public health concerns, and respond to climate change. Active transportation is a key part of creating vibrant urban areas, and bike lanes provide an essential foundation for cities to become cleaner, healthier, and more connected.\nFurthermore, urban infrastructure planning should reflect local needs and concerns, not a one-size-fits-all approach imposed from the provincial level. Local communities and their representatives understand best what is needed to enhance their unique infrastructure, and by stripping municipalities of the ability to respond flexibly to local transportation needs, this legislation compromises their capacity to plan effectively for the future.\nI urge the Ontario government to reconsider this legislation and advocate for a transportation policy that respects the autonomy of Ontario\u2019s cities, supports safe and sustainable transportation options, and encourages an active lifestyle for all residents. Investing in bike infrastructure is an investment in Ontario\u2019s future, and it\u2019s one we cannot afford to compromise.\n"

Currently day trips require my car which puts more traffic on the highway, and more traffic and parking downtown.\nBy removing Toronto's bike lanes, you remove a reason for me to visit or province's hub.\n"

Rob Ford does not represent Toronto, and micromanaging a city like this flies in the face of this own politics.\n"
