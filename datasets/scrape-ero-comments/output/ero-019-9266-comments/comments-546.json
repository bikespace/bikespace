        "comment": "Dear Minister of Transportation:\nOh boy.  This is a really power-centric bill.  There is NO GOOD reason to get this bill passed.  The provincial government needs to let the municipalities decide their future \u2026 not the provincial government!!\nThis is a bill that pulls rank and is an example of PROVINCIAL OVERREACH over municipalities that have spent time, energy, money to plan their cities/towns.  There has also been lots of input from residents in the areas for these bike lanes.   There has been money spent on consultants.  What makes the provincial government know what constituents want in these towns and cities?  At present, municipalities have the authority to design and install bicycle lanes on roads under their jurisdiction based on their OWN priorities and transportation context. This bill is provincial overreach into municipal decision-making. This is a very ill-advised bill.  How bout something that gets transit built on time and within budget?  Why are we spending money to get a bill to undo what is done?  Municipalities have not budgeted for this, and even if the province picks up the tab, ripping out functional transportation infrastructure is not fiscally responsible. My goodness you know how to waste time and money!!!  How bout spending time on pressing issues with climate change \u2026 more efficient, green transit instead of highways like the 413.  We need to move away from car-centric plans and elevate and change our habits \u2026 like better transit and more bikes on the roads.  Cars cause congestion and are polluters \u2026 not bikes.\nBikes \u2026\nBike lanes are an incredibly efficient way of moving people and are able to move many more people per hour than a lane focused primary on moving motor vehicles.  Bike lanes help to provide transportation choice, which helps to reduce the overall number of motor vehicles on the road. Just as highways result in more car trips, bike lanes increase cycling trips.  Bike lanes save lives, and help to make our roads safer for everyone, including people in motor vehicles.  Bikes are better for our health with fresh air and exercise \u2026 reducing the risk of chronic disease, reducing stress, and improving mental health.\nSo please \u2026 keep your hands off our roads/bike lanes.  My husband and I have sat and spent time with others giving input to look at traffic patterns \u2026 making sure traffic flow is not affected \u2026 but by making cyclists safe \u2026 not sure the provincial government would do any of this .. and its being done by the municipalities.  YOU DO NOT NEED to proceed with this bill \u2026 spend time on issues that are going to make a difference and are under the umbrella of the provincial government.\nThank you for listening.\n"

        "comment": "I am a Kitchener resident who both drives and cycles, and I strongly oppose a provincial bill 212. My reasons include:\n1) It undermines citizens and municipal leaders, who are the most knowledgable about, and the most invested in their cities.\n2) It is fiscally irresponsible to spend our taxes on projects that undo previously completed projects, without even evaluating them.\n3) It will make traffic worse long-term. My experience with bike lanes is that they help traffic. Just as carpool lanes form incentivizes that lead to fewer cars on the roads, so do bike lanes. Not to mention the increased safety they bring. Please also keep in mind that e-bikes and e-scooters have been soaring in popularity.\nKitchener has been building new housing at an astonishing rate over the last 10 years, and especially with high density condos. Making our city less automobiles-centric is by far the best chance that we have to avoid the gridlock that comes with automobiles as a main form of transportation in high-density areas.\nAs far as I can tell, this bill will make gridlock worse.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my concerns regarding Bill 212 and its potential impacts on public health, safety, mobility, access to communities, environmental protection, and Ontario's ongoing climate emergency. While the stated objective of reducing gridlock is commendable, I believe that the proposed means to achieve this goal are misguided and counterproductive.\nMunicipal Oversight and Bike Lanes\nI oppose the requirement for provincial approval before constructing new bike lanes where they replace a lane of traffic. This provision overreaches into municipal affairs, undermines local democracy, and disregards the extensive planning processes that always precede such projects. Municipalities have proven their capability to manage these matters effectively.\nMoreover, it is an established fact that adding more car lanes does not reduce traffic congestion due to induced demand. Instead of focusing on this ineffective approach, I urge you to prioritize investments in comprehensive transit projects and cycling networks province-wide. Every cyclist on the road is one less car, freeing up space for those who must drive and promoting healthier lifestyles.\nThe proposed removal of three bike lanes in Toronto, with thousands of daily users each, will put thousands more cars back onto the roads, exacerbating gridlock and local businesses' struggles. Cycling has been proven to boost business activity in areas where bike lanes are implemented.\nEnvironmental Concerns\nI strongly oppose exempting 413 lands from environmental assessments. The proposed highway route includes environmentally sensitive land that will be permanently lost as a carbon sink, natural habitat, and floodplain once paved over. Expediting this project without proper assessment disregards environmental protection and ignores the reality of induced demand, which will increase greenhouse gas emissions upon completion.\nLack of Expert Consultation\nI question whether any planners, environmentalists, engineers, or other credentialed experts were consulted during the creation of Bill 212. Their insights could have provided valuable perspectives and helped avoid these potential pitfalls.\nConclusion\nBill 212, in its current form, will not achieve its intended goal of reducing gridlock. Instead, it threatens to worsen traffic congestion, compromise public safety, harm local economies, destroy the environment, and negatively impact Ontarians' health outcomes. I urge you to reconsider this legislation and focus on genuine solutions such as investing in transit infrastructure and promoting alternative mobility options like cycling.\n"

There are more important issues going on that are in the provincial purview, like healthcare. If the province is insisting on ripping out bike infrastructure, then you must compensate the municipalities for all the costs of building them in the first place, at a minimum, otherwise you are wasting twice the taxpayer money that was already used. This is wasteful and a sign that the current government is hell bent on sticking with petty squabbles instead of governing for the people. This government does not deserve to govern if it can't get its head out of its behind and figure out the priorities of the province. You are effectively taking tax payer money from areas across the province to destroy infrastructure built with the money from taxpayers living in Toronto. We deserve better.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing this to say that I do not support Bill 212 and would like MPPs to vote against it.\nI understand the frustration from Ontario commuters about being stuck in traffic. However, Bill 212 will not reduce gridlock and will not save anyone any time. Studies have demonstrated that bike lanes actually reduce congestion [1], can reduce car travel time [2], will make roads safer for all users (including drivers and pedestrians) [3], and have been shown to provide economic benefits to local businesses in Toronto [4].\nThe existing bike lanes on Bloor St., Yonge St., and University Ave. are key travel arteries for the nearly 50% [5] of residents of Toronto/East York who cycle to work, school, go shopping, or visit friends. If bike lanes are removed as a result of this bill, then traffic will actually be more congested and slower. Therefore, the opposite of the goal of this bill will be achieved, if it is implemented.\nIf bike lanes are removed, cyclists may no longer feel safe cycling and they could switch to driving instead which will cause more cars on the road and thereby more traffic congestion. It has been repeatedly shown that more lanes leads to more traffic, not less, due to induced demand [6]. Furthermore, this will also increase the amount of greenhouse emissions put into the air (thus making it more difficult for Ontario to meet its goal of \"reducing our emissions to 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030\" [7]).\nAlternatively, if bike lanes are removed, cyclists may continue to bike on the streets where the bike lanes were, but they will instead be forced to bike in the car lanes. This leads to cars moving slower as they wait for an opening in the adjacent lane to swerve into to move around the cyclist which clearly impedes and slows down traffic. Also, cycling in car lanes is more dangerous for everyone. Cyclists should have the right to have a safe place to ride, especially given the recent increase in cycling-related fatalities [8].\nLastly, ripping out bike lanes will cost the province hundreds of thousands of dollars [9] and would cause a lot of congestion in the process. As a Toronto cyclist and Ontario taxpayer, I don't want my tax dollars used to remove existing infrastructure which keeps me and millions of others safe, all under the false pretense of \"reducing gridlock and saving time\" when in reality, there will be more traffic and longer travel times.\n"

        "comment": "This legislation will be terrible for everyone. Removing the bike lanes along Bloor, Yonge, and University will get cyclists killed and increase congestion for drivers, as adding lanes always does due to induced demand. What would actually reduce congestion would be reducing the number of cars on the road, which would be helped by improving the cycling network. \"We should not be catering to the 2% of people who cycle\" would be a strong argument in favour of removing bike lanes if Toronto had a large, well-connected network that nobody used, but this is not the case. The network is sparse, and cycling where it does not exist feels unsafe. Many people are, understandably, not willing to risk it.\nWhen I drive, I feel much safer knowing that I won't accidentally hurt anyone when cyclists are in their own lane and out of the way. The provincial government has no business meddling in what is fundamentally a municipal matter and it will be devastating if this passes.\n"

        "comment": "Hello to the government workers of the province of Ontario.\nI am an Ontario citizen here to say that I am against the need for Bill 212. Reasons why I say this are because we simply do not need to have this bill implemented in our provincial laws in the first place. Bike lanes, although not utilized as much in our province and in most cities, can and will be utilized by future generations that will live in our province.\nThey provide accessibility to those who wish to bike on the already built infrastructure, thereby letting people have the option to use something other than cars to travel; they can have barriers filled in with trees, plants, grass and other sorts of greenery; they make the streets with those combined barriers look much more nicer. One example of this success is the Bloor Street-Danforth Avenue corridor.\nAs a current resident of Toronto, I have personally witnessed the transformation of this one corridor, and how it went from cracked infrastructure and not so great traffic (I know traffic volumes are still not okay because we literally live in a city) and a not so aesthetically pleasing place, to a much more beautiful space filled with greenery and more open spaces for everybody.\nI have also seen various people use these lanes to ride their bikes on to travel where they need to. And yes, that can also include food delivery workers from Uber, SkipTheDish, and DoorDash as some examples. We have even seen in other parts of the world on how this was benefiting everyone. Such as the Netherlands, Denmark, France. We even have some places in Canada that provide bike lanes, like Montreal, which is great for travelling in bike lanes or Vancouver.\nWe might not have a perfect set in stone bike lane path infrastructure set in our cities, but we have already started planting the seeds, and the need for more travelling through bikes will grow not just in the municipal level, but throughout our province.\nWe have seen bike infrastructure projects in cities other than Toronto, such as Ottawa, and soon Hamilton.\nWhat Doug Ford is proposing is nothing more than pettiness from the fact that he lost the mayoral election for Toronto twice already. What he wants is nothing more than highways and roads to be the priority. And although it is already in this state of car infrastructure, and it\u2019s not like we won\u2019t need cars, roads or highways ever; we do need to consider as a society that not everyone can drive a car, some SHOULDN\u2019T be on the road driving (experience from driving in Brampton and the 401), and some can\u2019t afford to have a car as prices rise (and due to the fact that we live in one of the most expensive countries in the world).\nIn conclusion, we should not let the province decide what infrastructure cities, towns, townships and villages can build and what they cannot build. Cities are their own jurisdiction, and the province should not have power over what gets to be built in our local streets and areas. It will not be productive. People will protest the idea of that, whether it is right now, sooner in the future, or later on in the future. And plus, if we are REQUIRED to rip up the bike infrastructure on main roads such as Yonge Street, Bloor Street/Danforth Avenue and University Avenue, it will not only set us back decades, but it would also be costly to do so, as we have much more concerning issues to spend our taxes on, like building housing, new transit projects (even those POORLY managed, give us the Eglinton Crosstown, it\u2019s been 13 years), providing new jobs for everybody, etc.\nYou can take my word or leave, whatever suits your agenda; but take note of this those that are currently in the Ontario Government.\nIf you agree with this bill, know that it will not only effect everyday people, but it will also effect you and your families for those who want to build beneficial infrastructure other than help expand the road.\nSincerely,\nA very concerned Ontario citizen.\n"

I'm writing this letter to voice my concerns regarding the bike lanes.  Ever since these bike lanes were installed on Yonge Street in 2022, my business has been negatively impacted.\nI have lost many customers who went out of their way to use the services I provide.  Why? - the number one complaint I hear from my customers is the amount of traffic and difficulty it is to access my business.\u00a0 Most hours of the day the portion of Yonge St in front of my store is a parking lot.\u00a0 This is due to the combination of 7 traffic lights in less than one kilometre stretch of road and the bike lanes choking off lanes of traffic.\nDuring a past conference call with Councilor Mike Layton, the explanation given as to why Yonge Street was chosen for the bike lane project was to help bring customers to the area.\u00a0 As a business owner I can honestly say it has the opposite effect.  I constantly hear from customers complaining it took \"X\" amount of time being stuck in traffic to get to my location.\u00a0 Even though I offer customer parking, accessing the laneway in the rear of my building is very difficult as more cars are now overflowing onto the side streets.\u00a0 My biggest concern became a reality where my\u00a0customers were frustrated coming to the area and eventually went elsewhere.\nI also\u00a0experience\u00a0issues with my suppliers and vendors who complain about the amount of time it takes to get to my location.\u00a0 Complaints about where to park and drop-off.\u00a0 In fact one supplier has refused to make deliveries and I'm now forced to travel to Vaughn to pick-up my orders.\nIn conclusion, these bike lanes should not exist on Toronto's main and most busiest street. There has been too much\u00a0pain and suffering within the small business community due to Covid-19 where many have been forced to shut down.\u00a0 I can only hope my business will continue to operate for the foreseeable future, but in-order for this to happen, idealistic notions should not clash with the realities of everyday life.  Please do not harm businesses further by\u00a0promoting an agenda that doesn't work for the community.\nThank you for your consideration.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to you because I want you to consider the small business impact for the support of Toronto bike lanes.\nPeople use bicycles to enter small businesses in Ontario cities either as customers or delivery couriers. An open-for-business province with Red Tape reductions should encourage multiple entrances to small businesses.\nDense urban spaces with local retail shopping and restaurants are well-suited to attract customers from bicycles. This customer demographic can more easily enter a new location than from a car because of the ease of parking and the slower travel so the cyclist can read promotional signage from small businesses.\nThis is supported by Jiawei Shi's (2024) study of bicycle lanes and land use in Manhattan, NY.\nConsider the comparable city of Brisbane, Australia, with a population of 2.5 million (World Population Review, 2024) and recognizable suburban expansion (Satterley, 2024).\nFrom multiple surveys of restaurateurs and restaurant customers, Transport Economist Barbara Yen and colleagues (2020) found that only 18 percent of customers went to restaurants by car. While 7 percent of restaurant customers arrived by bicycle. This is a relatively small number. However, in Brisbane there are also thousands of entrants into restaurants who are bicycle food delivery riders, as found by Risk Management Professor Oscar Oviedo-Trespalacios and colleagues (2022).\nThere is clear aggregated evidence that bike lanes provide consumer activities into small businesses. As found in a literature review by U.C. Davis Transportation Professors Jamey Volker & Susan Handy.\nI hope that this information can be used to influence adjustments to bike lanes to cities in Ontario.\nWorks Cited\nOviedo-Trespalacios, O., Rubie, E., & Haworth, N.

        "comment": "The proposed Bill 212 is an extraordinary overreach into municipal jurisdiction. It will prevent the installation of life-saving infrastructure that is an essential part of an efficient and forward-looking transportation system, wasting taxpayers\u2019 money in the process.\nBike lanes are essential infrastructure for cyclists just as sidewalks are for pedestrians, and bus stops are for transit users. Car drivers are not the only road users, and bike lanes help keep our streets safe for ALL users. As a driver myself, I prefer when cyclists have the option to stay safely out of my way in a protected bike lane - I don\u2019t even need to worry about getting into an accident. I also appreciate having the option to leave the car at home and travel safely by bike, as it is faster and more convenient when making trips within my neighbourhood and in the surrounding areas.\nBill 212 discriminates against those who cannot afford a car or cannot drive, marginalizing individuals who rely on cycling to commute to work, to school or to pick up their children. It sends a message to a portion of our population that they are undeserving of safe access to our roads, infrastructure, and businesses. Doug Ford\u2019s inflammatory rhetoric only fuels tensions between drivers and cyclists, leaving cyclists, the more vulnerable of the two, at a severe disadvantage.\nFinally, ripping out existing bike lanes and cancelling plans developed by municipalities, which are better equipped to understand local traffic patterns and needs, is a blatant waste of taxpayers\u2019 money. The road closures required to remove bike lanes and redo lanes will in fact worsen congestion and commute times for ALL road users. Implementing a provincial review process for bicycle infrastructure will only add unnecessary red tape and bureaucracy to a process that does not and should not fall under provincial jurisdiction.\nOverall, Bill 212 is a regressive policy and will be harmful not only to cyclists, but to all road users. Cycling is a low cost, healthy and environmentally friendly method of transportation that gets people out of their cars, reducing the amount of congestion on the roads. Cycling infrastructure is an essential part of a efficient transportation system, enabling people to drive less and reach public transit hubs from further away.\nIf the province wants to get people and goods out of gridlock, and recognizes that accidents and lane closures worsen traffic congestion (as stated in bill 212) the province should focus on delivering public transit projects and on building bike infrastructure that prevents accidents and saves lives\n"

        "comment": "I staunchly oppose Bill 212 (Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024) for several reasons including: ineffectiveness, detrimental impact to the environment and quality of life, and safety concerns for road users.\nThe bill would facilitate the creation of more highways around Toronto and the replacement of bike lanes in the city with car lanes. It's been shown repeatedly that adding lanes doesn't actually improve commute times or reduce congestion. We've seen this abroad, but a local example of this is Jarvis Street where drive times worsened after bike lanes on the street were removed. The cost of these projects could be used to something more effective and helpful, like expanding public transit within the city and surrounding regions so commuters are less dependent on private transport to reach their destinations.\nFrom an environmental perspective, this bill is horrid. Schedules 2 and 3 are designed to fast-track roadway construction projects by shielding their early stages from due process. Section 2 of this bill provides exemption for the early stage projects of Highway 413 from the Environmental Assessment Act. Given effects we're seeing from climate change, it is absurd to me that the Ford government is seeking to further weaken our environmental protections. The planned route for Highway 413 passes through a sizable part of the Greenbelt and will damage rivers and farmland. The plan for the Bradford Bypass goes through the Holland Marsh and will damage important wetlands and woodlands. All of this would contribute to worse air quality, and consequentially, worse quality of life. The increase in emissions resulting from the construction of the highway and its use, and the damage done to our waterways, woodlands and farmlands far outweigh whatever marginal time savings there might be.\nThe removal of bike lanes from city roads also puts cyclists and drivers in greater danger. It forces cyclists closer to vehicles increasing the odds of serious, potentially fatal injuries. This will mean greater costs associated with emergency care, rehabilitation and legal processes. It would be better to keep the bike lanes in place and prevent more accidents from happening.\nIn conclusion, I firmly oppose Bill 212. It is a shortsighted mistake that caters to cars rather than the people of Ontario. It would further damage our environment, contribute hugely to air pollution, put more lives at risk and cost the taxpayer far too much - all for projects that would more than likely fail in their stated goal. The time, effort and funds that are going into this bill and the projects it aims to bolster are better spent on projects that instead prioritize efficacy, safety, and environmental guardianship.\n"

Soon after moving I started using the bike share, quickly this became my favorite way to get around my city. I have reduced my trips on both the TTC and by using cars/ride shares. This has saved me money and helped reduce my greenhouse emissions which is very important to me. Traveling by bike has allowed me to get into better shape and reignited by love for cycling. It has introduced me to local businesses, new parks and new friends. It even inspired me to participate in the ride to conquer cancer this past year where individually I raised over $6000 for a great cause.\nWhen I heard about this Bill, I was shocked to hear the province would be removing the most popular bike lanes in the city as well as getting rid of reviews for the highway 413. Both seems like a very inefficient use of taxpayer dollars. Bike lanes have already been put in, the additional construction and cost to remove them at this point is inexcusable. Municipalities should have the right to have bike lanes where they seem fit, they know the specific area better than the province would. The highway as well does not seem to improve commute time by a significant margin while also using a large amount of taxpayer dollars. I cannot support this bill in it\u2019s current form.\n"
