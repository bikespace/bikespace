        "comment": "Claims that bike lanes have increased response times for emergency services are unfounded and have been refuted by emergency services personnel, who would know of any negative impact first-hand.\nSimilarly, on most routes where bike lanes exist, whether or not a driving lane has been converted to a bike lane, driving times have not worsened significantly. Furthermore, on those impacted route, adjustments to signal timing can be, and have been, made to improve vehicular travel times.\nTraffic does not flow well in many places, both within urban boundaries and even on provincial highways. Many of those locations don't even have bike lanes, so what's the next excuse for the poor traffic flow? I'm sure many a motorist stuck in traffic doesn't enjoy seeing a cyclist breeze past them in their own dedicated lane. Still, scapegoating bike lanes is a tiny piece of low-hanging fruit that does not address the root cause of traffic flow problems anywhere, nor will it solve any traffic flow issue anywhere.\n"

It removes the extra worry of someone's mother, father, brother, sister, friend, or anyone in my blind spot accidentally getting their lives changed on my commute home. When I bike with the lanes there, I have that feeling of safety\u2014and I can't help but feel that the government does not have our best interests with removing these lanes in the name of removing congestion. Toronto's public transit system could absolutely use these investments in the name of reducing congestion as well that would make our system safer and fairer for all, while contributing to an eco-positive solution instead of more poison in our air.\nFord & government\u2014is this the legacy you want to leave behind? Less safety and future-forward solutions in exchange for a temporary fix for drivers?\n"

Regarding bike lanes, all the data show that bike lanes:\n1. save lives\n2. reduce congestion\n3. are good for the businesses along the route\n4. SAVE LIVES!!!!! Added for emphasis\nAdditionally, folks who commute by bike enjoy these benefits:\n1. increased exercise leading to better health and happiness\n2. saving money (so much less expensive than a car)\n3. arriving at destinations faster than driving\n4. easier to park a bike.\nBenefits of cyclists to society:\n1. better health = less use of our health care system (yup, saving the province $$)\n2. environmental - pretty obvious right? A cyclist's carbon footprint is much less than a car driver's footprint\nLet's also give a thought to the folks who can't afford a car - they can get around by bicycle. Migrant farm workers use bicycles to get into town for leisure. Women use bicycles to transport children. We should be making cycling a better option. When people feel safe on a bike, they ride a bike. It's that simple. Bike lanes do this. And sometimes they need to be on a main road.\nMunicipalities know best about where to install bike lanes. Don't add red tape by adding more bureaucracy to the process.\nRegarding Hwy 413... this is an environmental disaster. And it won't reduce gridlock at all.\nAgain, the irony of this page name Environmental Registry of Ontario, yet this bill is a One Two Punch to the environment.\nGive your head a shake.\n"

        "comment": "If this government were serious about \u201creducing gridlock,\u201d it would be making investments to the tune of several billion dollars to prioritize development and construction of extensive transit projects all over the province, and would invest considerable time, money and effort into the construction of more, comprehensive cycling networks. One more bike on the road is one less car; bikes take up far less space on the road than a single occupancy vehicle, thereby making more room for those who are or who must drive.\nIt is important to mention as well that the three bike lanes Premier Ford has pledged to remove in Toronto also see thousands of users per day\u2014that\u2019s literally thousands of cars that are off the road as a result. Local businesses are more successful in areas with bike lanes (this is easily proven looking at the Bloor Bike Lane reports prepared by City staff in Toronto), and various Toronto BIAs have already come out in support of bike lanes and the detrimental impact their removal would have on local businesses.\nCycling is also the far healthier option: physical activity leads to better health outcomes which leads to less money required for healthcare services.\nInstallation of bike lanes also have the added advantage of making the entire streetscape safer to use for all mobility modes; cars, bikes, pedestrians, and all others. Their existence can save the lives of cyclists and many others. Six cyclists have died on Toronto streets this year, and that is six too many; innocent lives lost because the victims were trying to get across town. Utterly senseless, with families shattered as a result.\nPertaining to bike lanes, my final comment is that the existence of these lanes gives all people greater access to their municipality. Those without the financial means to own a car, pay for insurance, parking, gas, etc. are more able to traverse their municipality for work, recreation, and to support the local economy. A car-centric community is a community that closes itself off to a considerable portion of its population.\n"

        "comment": "I have been driving on Bloor Street regularly for many years, long before the bike lanes were installed, both to take my daughters to school and drive to work. As a driver, I absolutely dread the idea of the bike lanes being removed. I do not wish to see a return to the days of drivers moving back and forth between lanes constantly because the right lane is blocked by parked cars, or there are spots where there is simply no room for a second lane of cars due to the street itself being narrowed, resulting in a bottleneck of two lanes converging.\nThe old system promoted aggressive driving because of this, with people trying to use small openings in the right lane to bypass other traffic. People who wait their turn should not be punished for it.\nMy drive times have remained exactly the same after the bike lanes were put in. I leave at the same time as I did before and still arrive on time. Now I can make the drive more calmly and with less anxiety. The bike lanes are a win-win for everyone.\nThere are much better uses for Ontario Taxpayer dollars to improve traffic.\n"

        "comment": "I oppose the proposed changes that would restrict the autonomy of municipalities in implementing bike lanes and prioritize highway expansion as the primary solution to traffic issues.\nFirst, this proposal to require provincial approval for bike lanes that repurpose vehicle lanes is a step backward for Ontario\u2019s urban planning and sustainability goals. Municipalities are best positioned to understand the unique needs and traffic patterns within their communities. By adding provincial oversight, Ontario limits local innovation in building safer, more sustainable transportation networks, while delaying projects that could reduce congestion and pollution.\nThe proposal\u2019s focus on removing bike lanes to \u201cfight gridlock\u201d overlooks a key reality: adding vehicle lanes does not solve congestion in the long term. Studies consistently show that widening or increasing road capacity induces more driving and ultimately leads to increased congestion. Bike lanes, on the other hand, create viable, safe alternatives to driving that reduce traffic, improve air quality, and provide accessible options for diverse commuters.\nMoreover, the stipulation that municipalities must collect and report extensive data on existing bike lanes is an unnecessary administrative burden that seems designed to discourage active transportation projects. Municipal resources could be better spent on expanding public transit, cycling infrastructure, and pedestrian-friendly spaces that actually reduce car dependency and improve quality of life for Ontarians.\nFinally, the prioritization of Highway 413 goes against Ontario\u2019s commitment to environmental stewardship. This project will disrupt critical ecosystems, farmland, and green spaces, fueling urban sprawl and emissions. Highways like 413 may offer a short-term convenience for drivers but come at the expense of long-term sustainability and climate resilience.\nWhile I support efforts to improve broadband access for all communities, Ontario\u2019s growth requires a balanced approach that includes sustainable, local transportation options. I urge the government to support the development of bike lanes, public transit, and walkable infrastructure that reflect Ontario\u2019s commitment to health, environment, and responsible urban growth\n"

I would like to see more bike lanes to encourage more trips by bike. Provincial legislation to hinder the development of municipal bike lanes doesn't make sense.\nA recent Ipsos poll commissioned by the Toronto Region Board of Trade reported that 86% of respondents agree that there is a traffic and congestion crisis in the region. When asked about the causes of congestion, 68% said too much construction and mismanagement of construction schedules, and 57% said too many cars and trucks on the road.

        "comment": "The first point that I would like to make is that the municipality's needs should take precedence over the province's desires, as those living in the municipality are the ones who are affected. Municipalities should be the primary lawmakers when it comes to issues that only affect their specific municipality, while the provincial government should only step in for province-wide issues, or when asked to.\nThe second point is that bikers who feel unsafe biking in car lanes will look for alternative modes of transportation, such as driving. By removing bike lanes, you are adding more cars to the road and creating even heavier gridlock than an extra car lane will not be sufficient for.\nConversely, by adding more bike lanes and creating a comprehensive network that allows one to bike across the city swiftly and efficiently, people who are not comfortable commuting by bike due to the lack of bike lanes on their route will be encouraged to bike for the commute by the added safety of bike lanes, reducing gridlock from cars. Most cars only contain one or two passengers, whereas the same amount of space that a car takes can fit many more bikers clustered together.\nAdditionally, having more bikers naturally increases business in the areas they are biking through, as it is much easier to stop by a cafe that catches your eye when you're on bike, as opposed to driving, where you have to find a parking space, potentially pay for parking, and deal with the hassle of merging back into traffic.\nThe last point I want to make is that by creating more bike lanes that will encourage people to consider biking as a primary mode of transportation, we are also encouraging people to be more active, which is always a good thing.\n"

        "comment": "Approving/removing bike lanes seems like a no brainer to help traffic flow, which is obviously a huge issue right now.  However, taking away reasons for people to give up their cars is not the answer because:\n1)Having a separate lane for cyclists (or anyone on wheels that move faster than pedestrians but slower than cars) helps the flow of traffic rather than impedes it for the following reasons:\na) slower moving wheeled transport requires traffic to slow down until a reasonable place to pass the slower road user becomes available.  Many times drivers get impatient and try to pass when it is not a good time, increasing the chance of accidents and therefore road closures.  If there is a fatality the road could be closed for the whole day while police investigate.\nb) a lot of the time the bike lane replaces a part of the road that was used for parking.  In this case, not only is a driving lane not fore fitted but there is no slow down in traffic while people (in many cases, try to) parallel park.\nc) helps people using alternative transportation feel safer on the road and therefore more likely to use it, removing vehicles from the road.\n2) earth has an atmosphere and without it, all major life forms on this planet will perish including our species.  Forget climate change and consider this, the removal of trees that remove carbon dioxide from our atmosphere will result in carbon dioxide levels suffocating us eventually.  The less carbon dioxide we add to the atmosphere the longer it will take to reach this point we need to get away from using cars.  We have a duty to future humans to do what we can to allow them to experience what we have.\n3) most of the world is taking steps forward to reduce emissions not increase them.  World governing bodies are asking us to reduce emissions, we need to do our part. I personally am embarrassed to live here, this province is doing everything possible to go in the other direction!\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are installed with rigorous assessments from city staff. Street widths, traffic volumes, demand, density, and many other factors are considered in this process. Public consultations are made and designs are adjusted to fit stakeholders' needs. The installation of a bike lane is a highly researched, community-involved, and democratic process. After all, many of us vote for our mayors and councillors with the expectation that they uphold their promises to promote alternative methods of transportation. To take such a process and bring it under the jurisdiction of an entity that involves itself in none of this research and project specific community-involvement, so that entity can, with no data and no consultation, veto all that work to please a specific base of voters is appalling. Ontario needs evidence backed legislation crafted with data, not desperate attempts to appeal to voters of certain ridings as we approach an election. The number of cyclists is only growing. Six people have been killed in the city of Toronto alone just this year. This is higher than any other year within the past decade. To refuse to provide safe infrastructure to the growing number of cyclists in this province is to accept that this death toll will continue to climb in the upcoming years.\n"
