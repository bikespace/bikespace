        "comment": "I am opposed to this legislation for the following reasons:\n1) Municipalities are better suited to determine what is the best mix of cycling and vehicular infrastructure. They know the local requirements better than a politician sitting at Queen's Park. They will base it on science and data as opposed to the Minister of Transportation influenced by the feeling of a vocal few. The province should treat municipalities as adults instead of children.\n2) Removing cycling lanes to add a car lane will not decrease congestion. It will most likely increase it due to induced demand (see first 2 links). Conversely removing a car lane to put in a cycling lane will most likely reduce congestion as it will encourage some to ride (especially if the cycling lane is segregated from the car lane) in instead of driving. Others may choose public transit.\n3) The suggest that there will side streets to put in a cycling lane does not always work. Bloor Street West in Toronto is a prime example. There for one thing there is the 401 and a river that will prevent this. See third link.\n4) Removing an existing cycling will increase injuries and fatalities. Avid cyclists will still use the street that had a lane, but now have to take the lane, slowing cars behind them, frustrating them and some will a make close path putting the cyclist or the opposing traffic in danger. I have experienced this first hand!\nSo in conclusion I encourage the Ontario Government to with this legislation and keep people safe and moving when navigating our city streets.\n"

Some can\u2019t afford a car, or like me it\u2019s just amazing to see Toronto from a different view. We all know how bad the city\u2019s traffic is! I love the feeling biking gives me it\u2019s like a freedom I\u2019ve never really had. It would be so much more dangerous to bike with no lanes, and some parents wouldn\u2019t feel confortable with their teens biking alone. Some people count on the ability to bike to get to work to earn money to feed their family. All I\u2019m asking is that consider keeping the bike lanes as the are so critical to Toronto working.\n"

And as someone who travels throughout North America and Europe, I enjoy the experience and safety of well planned bike lanes in many different countries.\nBut the Bloor bike lanes, especially between High Park and Islington Avenue, are an intimidating mess of confusing and obfuscating structures, symbols, signs, colours and patterns. Since these formidably complex  bikes lanes have been installed, I avoid Bloor Street altogether (including sadly, the restaurants, cafes, shops and services I've long enjoyed) as a driver, biker or pedestrian!\nMoreover, bike lanes should be installed on secondary roads - certainly not on Bloor street where a subway runs underneath, parking and stopping areas are essential to the survival of shops, and Cafe TO locations already add another level of complexity to our village neighbourhoods.\nFinally, these bike lanes have brought vehicle travel to a complete standstill at many times of the day and evening, causing major delays, stress and other safety problems.\nWhen planning bike lanes in the City, there needs to be substantive, effective projections of their impact on neighbourhoods  - and effective design that is clear and understandable to bikers, drivers and pedestrians.\n"

Cyclists are concidered 'vulnerable pedestrians' in the eyes of the city, and removing a very important safety net they have is, again, dangerous and impractical.\n"

        "comment": "As a 30+ year resident of the Bloor/Kingsway neighbourhood, I am a longtime user of the various businesses along Bloor between Prince Edward and Islington. With the addition of the poorly designed bike lanes, I purposely avoid this section of Bloor now because it is dangerous. The bike lanes are wider than the parking lanes which makes entering and exiting your vehicle dangerous as you are stepping out directly into traffic. It is doubly dangerous for seniors and small children. I have been told by local businesses that because of this safety concern, their businesses are suffering as seniors and families with small children do not wish to park on Bloor. And the vehicle traffic congestion created by these large bike lanes means bumper to bumper traffic most of the day. This situation did not exist pre bike lanes. I do support bike lanes, where necessary, and if it is deemed that they are necessary on this section of Bloor, then at least they should be halved in size. There is no need for a bike lane wider than a vehicle parking lane. And the safety painting on the street and the reflective bollards have really trashed up the look of what used to be a beautiful section of Bloor. It is poorly designed and an eyesore. If you need bike lanes this wide on this street why not destroy the street entirely by bulldozing the beautiful median? I support removing this bike lane, but if it has to remain, it needs to be reduced in width by half so as to allow us to have some semblance of a functioning street once again.\n"

I oppose 195.2 (3) for the reasons stated above.\nBoth of these are gross oversight of the powers of the province to interfere in local matters.\nAs a property owner in the City of Toronto I believe we should make decisions about our neighborhoods. By removing the power from my local elected officials I see that your government does not value good governance, nor small government.\nFurther as a driver I support that bicycle lanes are maintained on Bloor St. on University Ave. and on Yonge St. as all three feel better for driving now that the lanes are there. Prior to having bicycle lanes on these streets people in bicycles we're unpredictable and in the way of traffic. With bicycle lanes the street functions more consistently. I personally do not find any of these three streets to have more traffic then before the lanes went in.\nI stress that the province should not be interfering in local matters please stick to healthcare and education. Do not add extra layers of administration to our over burdened municipalities. They know best about local planning decisions.\nAgain the province should not be regulating the use of space on the streets within cities, focus on 400 level highways as per your are mandate.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes should not be removed. The province should be committed to ensuring that all modes of transportation (via trains, bikes, and walking) is safe. By removing dedicated bike lanes, it will increase the chances of people who bike unsafe conditions. Further, having bike lanes removed will not reduce the number of bikes on the road, which will mean that cars will still have to swerve to avoid them which could cause more congestion, not less. If the only reason for bike lanes to be removed is because it is not a highly used mode of transportation, then many, many other social or economic programs should be eliminated as well by that logic. Time, money, and planning have gone into the development of bike lanes, and currently, there is no justification as to why bike lanes should be removed. Further, instead of targeting bike lanes to tackle the issue of congestion, why not identify reasons why people do not take an alternative mode of transportation instead? If the public transport system was more frequent, reliable, affordable, safer, and dependent, would people still require cars as much?\n"

I live in downtown Toronto just south of Bloor St and Ossington Ave. I know about bike lanes because I watch people who use them every day, a number of times a day. Where I live, they are the safest way to ride a bicycle.\nMy son has been riding a bike in Toronto since before the bike lanes were built. What a sigh of relief I had when he came home and was so thrilled because it was safer than riding in car traffic.\nI am thinking about starting a group called \"Drivers for Bike Lanes\" because when I drive, I like order. I like people staying in their own lanes and driving at the speed limit. Bike lanes stop drivers who are angry at people on bikes.\nI predict chaos if these lanes are removed. There will be way less order and you can't get anywhere fast in a car when there is no order!\n"

An extra lane of traffic will be quickly filled, and gridlock will continue.  Bike lanes allow people to get healthy exercise in a no-carbon-causing form.

While this may seem like a direct solution to traffic problems, it fails to account for the well-established phenomenon of induced demand. This concept suggests that simply building more roads encourages more people to drive, which can actually increase congestion in the long run. Rather than reducing gridlock, expanding infrastructure often leads to even worse traffic as more vehicles take advantage of the newly constructed lanes, quickly filling them up. This cycle of endless road expansion is not a sustainable solution and could ultimately lead to a \u201cbigger is worse\u201d situation.\n2.

More roads lead to greater carbon emissions, which is a direct contradiction to Ontario\u2019s climate goals. The construction and maintenance of highways require significant energy and materials, and increased car usage contributes to air pollution and worsens the province's carbon footprint. Additionally, expanding highways encourages urban sprawl, as more land is developed for new housing, businesses, and industries along major roadways. This sprawl can diminish green spaces, harm ecosystems, and increase the pressure on municipal services in new suburban areas.\n3. Neglecting Public Transit and Active Transportation\nThe Act\u2019s focus on roads and highways overlooks the crucial role of public transportation and active transportation (e.g., walking and cycling) in solving gridlock. For Ontario to truly reduce traffic congestion and improve quality of life, the government needs to prioritize investments in transit systems, such as buses, subways, and commuter trains. Expanding these systems would provide Ontarians with viable alternatives to driving, reducing the overall number of vehicles on the road. The Act should also place a stronger emphasis on creating safe cycling lanes and pedestrian pathways to encourage active modes of transport. By neglecting these areas, the government is not addressing the underlying need for sustainable transportation solutions.\n4. Lack of Focus on Congestion Pricing and Demand Management\nInstead of simply building more roads, Ontario should explore solutions that manage traffic demand. Measures like congestion pricing, which charges vehicles to enter high-traffic areas during peak hours, have proven effective in cities around the world, such as London and New York. The Act misses this opportunity to implement more sophisticated strategies to reduce congestion in a way that encourages people to take public transit or adjust their travel habits. Without addressing demand management, the province risks continuing to support a car-dependent culture, which exacerbates gridlock rather than alleviating it.\n5. Impact on Local Communities and Quality of Life\nThe expansion of highways and road networks under this Act could have detrimental effects on local communities. New roads often pass through residential neighborhoods, leading to increased noise, pollution, and the disruption of local businesses. These communities may find themselves trapped between expanding highways and deteriorating environmental conditions, ultimately reducing their quality of life. Additionally, road expansion can lead to displacement of existing residents, particularly in underprivileged areas, who may be forced to relocate due to construction projects or gentrification driven by increased access to transportation corridors.\n6. Missed Opportunity for Innovative Solutions\nInstead of continuing with outdated and car-centric solutions, the Ontario government should be looking for more innovative transportation alternatives. This could include increasing investment in shared mobility services like carpooling, ride-hailing, and autonomous vehicles. There is also potential to integrate smart traffic management systems that can reduce congestion by optimizing traffic flow.

I think we can all agree that this in itself reduces traffic. Part of what allows me to do this is bike lanes. When I was in grade 11, a street near my house was refurbished, and part of that refurbishment involved adding bike lanes. For the first time I was able to bike to school without having an unnervingly high number of near misses. And no, traffic did not become observably worse as a consequence of their addition.\nRipping out Toronto's bike lanes, at a time when the provincial deficit is approaching historic rates, is petty, partisan government waste neither Toronto nor Ontario can afford, whether it costs 1, 5, 20, or 48 million dollars. It represents a wasteful, arrogant, and petty view of tax dollars that represents the worst of politicians and government.\nTimes are changing. Not everyone can be expected to spend hundreds of dollars a month on car expenses. Nor can the government afford to waste any amount of money tearing up infrastructure.

        "comment": "Everyone can agree that traffic in our cities can be improved. However, bike lanes are an essential part of the solution, and the removal of already-implemented bike lanes would be a misallocation of taxpayer funds. Many commuters - myself included - are multi-modal, meaning we use transit, ride bicycles, and drive cars. Each time such a commuter decides not to drive, because a better alternative is available, we are alleviating traffic congestion. The opposite is true if more car lanes are provided, as the increased road capacity is always filled - a proven phenomenon known as induced demand.\nIn many cases, bike lanes were not installed at the expense of vehicle lanes, but parking or excess space in the roadway. Bike lanes are also an important part of road safety measures (outside of rush hour when vehicles are moving faster)  such as wider sidewalks and planters, which ultimately improve the street for all users and local businesses. Without bike lanes, cyclists will ride in the vehicle lane (as they are legally permitted to do) and pedestrians will have less of a buffer to vehicle traffic, making streets less safe for all.\nWe are also rapidly intensifying our transit corridors with high-rise housing development with little to no parking - and rightfully so, given the housing crisis. We must build the necessary infrastructure to support this new housing, particularly improved bicycle and transit infrastructure.\nIf we are serious about improving traffic, let\u2019s approach the problem holistically and implement measures that will actually make the best use of the limited road capacity in our growing cities. Bike lanes are essential in core city areas where we cannot easily build new roads or highways.  We must keep them and continue to develop other alternatives to driving for commuters as well, such as improved transit and congestion pricing.\n"

Specifically: King street from Erb to Columbia, and Erb street from Caroline to Peppler. I have been very happy with these lane reductions. As someone who drives, walks, and bikes to get around, I haven't noticed much reduction in travel time for most routes, but I have noticed many more people using active transportation (especially near Columbia and King, which is closest to where I live) to get around. I have also noticed that walking from my house near Columbia and King to the uptown core near King and Erb feels much safer than it did 10 years ago before the bike lanes were installed.\nI hope that the city of Waterloo will continue to prioritize bike infrastructure as it grows. I would especially love to see bike lanes connecting uptown to the river, as there are currently some proposals to install them all the way up Erb street.

Most importantly, it has been proven by various studies that removing bike lanes will not \"reduce gridlock\" or \"save us time\". Removing the bike lanes will require construction and temporary disturbances to the neighbourhood, only to regress as a society and its infrastructure progress. No bike lanes will deter commuters from biking and resorting to the already overcrowded and underperforming public transit, or worse, drive and add to the existing traffic load. As a Torontonian, almost everyone knows that biking is more often than not the fastest way to get around downtown, especially during rush hours and streetcar delays.\nRemoving bike lanes will mean that Ontario prioritizes the negligible richer motorists over the lives of cyclists, not to mention the inital problem will not even be fixed. The money to reverse existing improvements to our infrastructure should be used on transit or housing instead - the more pressing problems that Ontarians are struggling with. What about bus and streetcar dedicated lanes? That will speed up traffic more than putting everyone in the same lanes.\nThe province should be more knowledgeable than this - it is so clear that this is merely a selfish and uneducated suggestion. I am disappointed that this was even suggested in the first place.\n"
