This legislation will lead to more deaths and the blood will be on your hands.\nBike lanes give those who cannot, or do not wish to drive a fast and affordable way of getting around. This legislation would take that away from them, and force many back into crippling traffic.\n"

        "comment": "This is dumb and an unbelievable waste of tax-payer money! Putting in an extra lane of traffic doesn't reduce congestion, as the last 100 years have shown repeatedly, in thousands of cities all around the world. The only thing that works is viable alternatives to driving - which includes cycling, morons.\nWhy can't you put this money towards health care? Or housing? Or anything else? Stop with the war on cars bullshit and maybe make changes that will actually make a positive difference in people's lives. Or is that too much to ask from this government?\n"

        "comment": "This proposed legislation is ridiculous. Decades' worth of data from cities all over the world show that increasing the number and extent of bike lanes in a city is one of the best ways to reduce gridlock and improve traffic because bike infrastructure makes it safer for people to cycle, so more people choose to cycle, which in turn means fewer cars jamming up the streets. Removing bike lanes is absurdly wasteful, and putting administrative barriers in the way of adding new ones directly prevents you from achieving your own goals of reducing gridlock--to say nothing of making our streets less safe. This entire plan also goes in exactly the opposite direction of what we need to do to prevent and mitigate climate change. This is 2024. Stop trying to take us back to the 80s with retrograde policy!\n"

        "comment": "It is important to improve our infrastructure for all modes of transportation. This means providing individuals a variety of means to reach their destination, while prioritizing safety. From my perspective as someone living in the GTA, we have been prioritizing car-centric developments for far too long. Having protected bike lanes are so important for many people living in the GTA and encourages new cyclists, reduces motor congestion, reduces emissions, saves money, and improves health. Please continue prioritizing cycling and pedestrian infrastructure.\n"

        "comment": "This is absolutely ridiculous and draconian. The notion that cities should require the province's permission before installing new bike lanes--WHETHER OR NOT any such new lanes would require the removal of a car traffic lane--is patently absurd. It's none of the province's business how cities choose to manage their traffic. What is this, a province-wide homeowner's association? Or cityowner's association, as the case may be. Back off with your dystopian nightmare.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212, the Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024, should be opposed due to its lack of evidence supporting effectiveness in reducing congestion and high implementation costs that could divert funds from critical services (healthcare and education). Additionally, the bill neglects necessary investment in public transportation, risks community displacement through increased development pressures, and has faced significant resistance from local communities. Furthermore, it fails to adequately address environmental concerns, including but not limited to, increased emissions from continued reliance on personal vehicles, undermining efforts to promote sustainability. These issues highlight the need for a more comprehensive and inclusive approach to tackling traffic challenges.\n"

        "comment": "Keep the bikes lanes. Removing bike lanes will actually increase congestion because now that person riding a 1.5m bike has to drive a car which takes up 4x the amount of space on the road.\nProviding safe alternatives to driving a car is the only way to reduce congestion. Whether that\u2019d be bike lanes or better public transit. In fact, I took a trip to Japan earlier this year and I was amazed at how effective public transportation is over there.\nAlso, the provincial government should keep their hands out of governing municipalities. We have a provincial government that only cares about the GTA and not the province as a whole. I feel like I\u2019m going back to Gr. 5 when I say, the Federal Government is responsible for the country, the Provincial Government is responsible for the province, and the Municipal Government is responsible for cities.\nLook at the research and studies that prove more car lanes = more traffic on roads and highways.\n"

        "comment": "I totally disagree with this legislation. I use TTC and bike lanes in Toronto. That's because parking is the determining factor. There is no place to park downtown unless you earn in excess of 200,000. So driving your car to work in congestion is only part of the problem. Parking is the bigger problem. So even if no congestion there is no place to park. Next. Stop lights and crosswalks. There are four way pedestrian crossings with traffic stopped in all directions. That causes congestion. Poor timing of lights causes comgestion. Dedicated bus lanes, streetcar tracks (St Clair) and crosstown light rail at points causes congestion. Drivers blocking intersections cause gridlock. Next is the congestion caused by urban sprawl. That will only get worse as people seek affordable housing outside of the core. The congestion this creates won't be solved by removing bike lanes. Next. Major congestion is on the 401 and the DVP And the Gardner expressway where there are no bike lanes. Bike lanes are focused on the city core. Where you have buses and street cars fighting with cars whether you have bike lanes or not. The core should be for streetcars, buses, subways, taxis, Uber/Lifts delivery vehicles AND BIKES EBIKES AND ESCOOTERS. So. It's too late to solve congestion. It was here before bike lanes. Just like public transit expansion (Crosstown and Ontario line and GO expansion are a product of the desire to admit congestion can't be solved so put public transit in place to move people into and out of city cores. And this includes bike lanes. There is a coherent strategy to provide these modes of transit as an alternative to an unsolvable congestion problem. And I haven't even addressed the environmental cost of unsolvable congestion and the benefits of alternative transit. This is not a good idea. It is a bad idea and will negate the good work done by cities that know there transportation needs. They k!ew there would be complaints but there is no other choice. To reverse what they have done would require compensation from the province. It will not be a free political lunch.\n"

        "comment": "If you want to reduce gridlock, it's best to encourage the use of bicycles and increase the development of bike lanes, not the reverse. Bikes take up less space and leave roads freer for people who have no choice but to drive. A bike-friendly city is healthier and consumes fewer fossil fuels.\nI'd provide citations and sources that confirm this, but this government is seemingly not interested in evidence-based decision making.\n"

        "comment": "I find it extremely counter-productive that the province would go so far as to remove efficient forms on transit in favour of inefficient ones. Instead of making our roads safer, all this will do is cause more accidents, increase our CO2 output, and remove healthy forms of transportations.\nWhy isn't the province focused on ensuring that transit under their purview (Metrolinx) actually complete their projects? That would actually help grid lock. Why isn't the province focused on actually building mass transit in the areas we know the province appears to be obsessed about?\nWhy does the city of Toronto not have funding necessary to properly serve the people in the East? Why is the province not considering working with their jurisdictions on solutions instead of overriding them?\nThe province\u2019s incoming approach to transit policy is not only short-sighted but dangerous. It creates traffic congestion, increases accidents, and hinders efforts to fight climate change. The focus should be on building and improving mass transit, particularly in underserved areas, and completing long-overdue projects that have the potential to actually move people, not cars.\n"
