        "comment": "I absolutely object to the proposal.  Most specifically: \"Prescribed municipalities would be required to seek provincial approval to allow for the implementation of new bicycle lanes (\u201cbike lanes\u201d) that require the removal of an existing lane of traffic\" and \"\u2026 municipalities to submit information about existing bike lanes on municipal roads where an existing vehicle lane was removed.\u201d\nThe assumption that bike lanes lead to traffic congestion is political rhetoric and unsupported by facts and data.  There are studies that demonstrate the opposite is true.  To state the obvious, what causes traffic congestion and gridlock is the volume of cars on the roads.  We will not solve it by making other modes of transportation less available.\nMy own transportation looks like this: I drive, I take the bus, I ride my bike, and I walk.  Every trip is a conscious choice and depends on many variables: distance, weather, route, purpose of the trip, etc.  When I choose to take the bus, ride or walk; there is one less car on the road contributing to the traffic problem.   The more safe and accessible routes I have available to me, the less I am contributing to the traffic problems.  Similarly, if I and others don\u2019t feel safe on our bikes, then that translates to more traffic.  Better bike infrastructure = less traffic congestion.\nI vehemently object to the implications of the statement: \u201cThe Government of Ontario recognizes that accidents and lane closures can worsen traffic congestion and impact the quality of life of Ontarians.\u201d  As above, I do not accept that creating safe cycling routes worsens traffic congestion. Accidents caused by unsafe infrastructure surely does \u201cimpacts the quality of life of Ontarians\u201d, and I do not accept that my government would reduce the safety of one of the most affordable, healthy and environmentally friendly modes of transportation.\nThe possibility of existing bike lanes being removed has been raised.  I can think of no greater irresponsible mis-use of taxpayer dollars.  My municipal has the authority to understand community needs and priorities.  I will not accept the provincial government getting involved in this way.\n"

        "comment": "Bill 212 is a significant overreach of provincial authority. This measure contradicts continuously demonstrated benefits of essential cycling infrastructure. Studies repeatedly show that bike lanes ease congestion, reduce emissions, and have positive impacts on local business. Bike lanes are also essential to ensuring safety of pedestrians and cyclists.\nIt is well established that the only way to improve traffic flow is to reduce the amount of single vehicle traffic. The only way to achieve this is through improved public transportation and increased use of active transportation, both of which significantly reduce the number of cars on the road. One of the largest barriers to increased use of active transportation within Ontario is safety. Painted bicycle lanes and shoulders do not provide a sense of safety for cyclists and pedestrians. Well connected and physically separated bicycle lanes are required to promote the use of active transportation.\nBills claiming to \u201creduce gridlock\u201d and \u201csave us time\u201d should be based on published evidence and should promote the use of active transportation with the development of well designed infrastructure. Transportation bills should promote increased cycling infrastructure with the use of well established design principles that are proven to reduce traffic congestion, not hinder the use of active transportation with the removal of cycling lanes.\nBill 212 must be blocked or rewritten to support evidence-based urban design that has been proven to reduce congestion (improved public transportation, well designed active transportation infrastructure, both of which need to be well connected.)\nhttps://www.cbc.ca/news/science/bike-lanes-impacts-1.7358319\nhttps://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5c0e5848e5274a0bf3cbe124\u2026\nhttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01441647.2021.1912849#abst\u2026\nhttps://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/30/2/161\n"

To remove a car lane when bikes can safely take side streets is irresponsible and not treating everyone fairly.  If bikes want to share the over crowded roadways and shitty infrastructure that can\u2019t accommodate our population growth than licenses, tests and insurance need to be applied. It has been irresponsible taking away lanes when we are bursting at the seems and wreck-less for communities where the cars are being forced into.  The Toronto survey they send out is biased and doesn\u2019t allow for the proper vetting of how people feel and Mayor Chow has taken liberties.\n"

I bike when I can, but however I travel, more bikes and safe bike lanes make for a smoother commute for everyone. Bike lanes are not the problem. Cars are the problem, poor city planning and public transportation that has not kept up with population growth are all part of the problem.  If you take away the bike lanes, then I will have to drive instead. That adds pollution to the air, more traffic for everyone, and worse health for me. We should be looking at ways to encourage more people to bike!!\n"

        "comment": "I acknowledge and respect that municipalities are creatures of the province. However, I have significant concern regarding the proposal for the province to have the authority to approve the implementation of a bike lane, if it removes a lane of vehicle traffic. My concerns are:\n1) First and foremost, it with only continue to promote private automobiles as the primary mode of travel, instead of encouraging modal shift to more sustainable travel options. Many global cities highly regarded with good planning principles, such as Amsterdam or Copenhagen, have successfully integrated all modes of travel into their transportation networks.\n2) The prompt provided on the province's website - \"Prescribed municipalities would be required to seek provincial approval to allow for the implementation of new bicycle lanes (\u201cbike lanes\u201d) that require the removal of an existing lane of traffic. Approval will be based on a set of specified criteria, to be set out in guidance and/or regulation.\" - Does not identify what a \"prescribed municipality\" is nor does it define the \"specified criteria\". This is critical information to understand the context of the proposal.\n3) Municipalities know their local context the best - requiring provincial input on bike lanes will significant slow down timescale for streetscape improvements, and may miss consideration for the local community wants and needs. For a province as wide and diverse as Ontario, we need to consider that needs vary greatly across urban and rural areas.\n4) Streetscape projects, which may include the addition of cycling infrastructure, are commonly completed in relation to other roadway improvement projects. This requires a holistic perspective of the overall road corridor improvements, and should not review the approval of bike lanes in a silo.\n5) Lastly, this proposal has caused confusion and unnecessary stress. Leaving out critical components, such as what a prescribed municipality might be, is not helpful in understanding what this proposal may entail. It only creates more questions and uncertainty.\n"

Bicycle lanes are important to me, among other reasons because I commute to work by bicycle year-round and I like to feel safe doing so. Making it easier for cars to get around (and placing barriers on alternative modes of transportation) will simply encourage more people to drive and increase volume, which will increase gridlock. Toronto and the Province of Ontario need to encourage people to travel by other forms of transportation than just driving (walking, cycling, transit, GO train, etc\u2026). Investing in those other forms of transportation will encourage people to use them and in my view is the only viable long-term solution to decrease gridlock.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is a massive waste of tax payer's money. To tear out infrastructure that was only recently completed is absurd. Not only will it make the streets less safe for the 100s of thousands of people in Toronto and Ontario who commute by bicycle each day, but the imminent road closures will further inconvenience drivers! Many BIAs in areas like Bloor Street, Yonge and University are against this as they realize most of their direct business comes from cyclists, pedestrians and transit riders. Share the data before any of these decisions are made.\nBike lanes are not the cause of congestion on the Don Valley Parkway, The Gardiner Expressway, Allen Expressway, the increasing amount of automobile traffic is. If this government was really serious about solving our \"congestion crisis\" they would implement road tolls, congestion charges, limit and restrict ride share app vehicles, and finish the transit projects (Hello Eglinton Crosstown?) or at least adequately fund ones that already exist.\nIncreasing well-thought out bike lane infrastructure networks in cities not only encourages people to not use their cars, but promotes exercise and physical well-being while choosing a cost-effective and environmentally responsible mode of transportation. Making a safe and accessible bicycle lane network in cities should be the goal, as seen in cities like Paris or London.\n"
