Instead, this government is proposing to remove the bike lanes that were just completed for their own political dog-whistling.\n"

        "comment": "I am a commuting cyclist. I ride year-round.\nHere\u2019s why:\nFrom where I live to where I work there isn\u2019t a convenient or tolerable transit route. Cabs and Uber are too expensive. I don\u2019t drive - although sometimes I get a ride & get stuck in the congestion of the downtown core where bike lanes do not exist. It is a 2 hour walk.\nSome people choose to ride, my bicycle is a logistical necessity. Removing bike lanes that allow me to access my livelihood with less stress than it already requires to take to the road are essential. A barrier between me & the desperate, angry, distracted drivers gives me some peace of mind.\nRemoving the meagre safety measures in place that are already often filled by construction, delivery drivers, confused or belligerent motorists, or other safety hazards, puts us in further danger. It encourages a more aggressive approach to driving on a road shared with all vulnerable road users and will end with casualties. I & my community are incredibly insulted that this is even an issue in 2024. Shame on this leadership.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is based on non-existent data and hearsay. There have been widespread studies that state we should be building more cycling and public transit infrastructure to support our growing population. Induced demand for highway & roadway infrastructure is real and has been studied multiple times over. The bill says it aims to reduce gridlock. Why is the province going against, what should be, common knowledge? The premier is making outrageous claims and they are being debunked by the media with regards to this bill. It's very clear the path that we need to go down for us to achieve our desired common goals of reducing our carbon footprint while improving the economy.\n"

        "comment": "Please review relevant data. Not stale data from 2011 that cites 1.2% of people commute via bicycle.\nToronto continues to densify and we require diverse methods of transit to get around our city.\nNot everyone can use a car, we don't have the space. Not everyone can use public transit, we don't have the infrastructure. And not everyone can cycle, for a variety of reasons. It isn't realistic to expect everyone to rely on one single method, so please stop catering to motorists. It's obvious they're the biggest voting block.\nCyclists aren't asking to ban cars. This isn't a \"war on cars\". Methods of transit shouldn't be politicized and people's lives and safety shouldn't be up for debate. This is sad on so many levels. Toronto is going to become a city in decline and neither Ontario not Canada can afford that when Toronto makes up 50% and 20% of GDP respectively.\n"

        "comment": "Hi, I'm an avid and daily biker in the city of toronto. The fact that the province is proposing this bill is an immense disappointment. Not only do thousands of people in the city of Toronto use the bike lanes, they don't contribute to congestion, in fact they move thousands every single day, often faster than cars!  Removing bike lanes is moving us towards such car-dependency and away from walkable cities, one of the few in Canada. People like going to Europe for a reason, you can walk around! The idea of removing bike lanes just shows that the province really doesn't care about it's people. ALL the scientific research on this topic, ALL the case studies show that bike lanes IMPROVE mobility in a city.\nOn a further note, the idea of removing the need for environmental assessemnts for highway 413 is also so unbelievably unjust and immoral -- Why do you think Toronto is flooding more often? Why do you think our biodiversity is decreasing? There are rules and regulations in place because we cannot abuse this land.\nNOT to mention the idea of disallowing property owners from applying for a date of possession adjustment. Do you seriously not care about your people???\n"

        "comment": "I understand the importance of helping people reach their destinations more quickly. However, removing bike lanes is not the solution. As a Torontonian, I\u2019ve found that cycling often gets me to my destination faster than using public transportation or driving. Eliminating bike lanes won\u2019t stop people from biking\u2014it will just force cyclists to share the road with cars, ultimately slowing down traffic for everyone. Dedicated bike lanes ensure safer travel for cyclists while allowing cars to maintain the speed limit without unnecessary delays.\nThe real solution lies in investing in public transportation and bike infrastructure. Enhancing public transit efficiency and expanding bike lanes will make it easier and faster for people to get where they need to go, benefiting the entire community.\n"

In a time where climate change is causing chaos, gas prices are sky high, and traffic makes commuting almost impossible, we should be encouraging different forms of transportation.  Removing the bike lanes will not help with increased traffic.  It will just make it more dangerous for people who are using the bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "There is no supporting evidence that shows less bicycles on the road means less car congestion. Cars take up at least 4x the amount of space on the road than a bicycle does. Making transportation by bicycle less accessible will only increase the number of cars on the road, which will lead to more congestion. A different approach must be taken in order to reduce car congestion on the roads, such as increasing transit accessibility and frequency, incentivizing transit use, and more bike lanes in general. These are steps that will lead to less car congestion, rather than increase car congestion with more construction and more cars on the roads.\n"

        "comment": "I am opposed to this legislation for the following reasons:\nFirst, it is an egregious overreach by the provincial government into municipal affairs.  Having the right to do so doesn't make it right.\nSecond, it's a terrible waste of tax dollars, Toronto money already spent to build the bike lanes, and provincial money (from taxpayers all over the province) to tear them out.\nThird, even if they do cause delays (which in most cases could be resolved by better signal-light timing), expanding the bike network is the right thing to do.  Encouraging more people to drive in Toronto is just wrong.  it's cars, not bikes, that will choke the city.\nFourth, current usage of the bike lanes is basically irrelevant.  It's all about the future.\nFifth, if you apply the six degrees of separation, there is no doubt that every citizen of Toronto is connected to someone who has died in a cycling accident involving a motor vehicle.  There have been six so far this year.  I've lost two friends in the last ten years (and I don't belong to the cycling community).  One death is too many.\nLeave the bike lanes in Toronto in place.\n"

        "comment": "I am strongly opposed to this bill, which is going in the opposite direction of where we need to go as a province. It is a complete waste of money to rip up existing bike lanes, and fast-tracking Highway 413 to avoid proper environmental oversight is dishonest and reckless.\nShort-sighted policies like these will not reduce traffic congestion. What they will do is encourage more people to drive private cars, increasing climate pollution, making walking and cycling more dangerous, and reducing quality of life for people living and working along arterial roads. Decades of research shows that expanding highways leads to more congestion, not less. And these policies waste money that would be better spent on public transit, health care, and other services that actually contribute to community and environmental health.\nIt's very disturbing to me that the way this bill is presented completely fails to address the environmental and climate impact of discouraging cycling and public transit and destroying greenspace to expand highways. This is the opposite of what we need to do to stabilize the climate and preserve clean air and water and a natural environment that is safe from flooding, pollution, and other climate impacts.\nI don't generally vote Conservative, but I would if I saw a Conservative government showing leadership on environmental conservation and climate change mitigation and adaptation, as some Conservative governments in the UK and some past PC governments in Canada have done. That would be thrilling. In the meantime, I hope to at least see the Ontario government backing down on misguided bills like this one that will waste taxpayers' money and only make pollution and traffic congestion worse.\n"

        "comment": "The bike lanes provide an essential path of travel for many residents. The flow on traffic on Bloor is consistently very good as it allows for a section for people to drive, park, and bike. If you compare this to a road like Queen street or Dundas it's much more congested. One of the reasons is that cars consistently park on the right hand lane, causing much more congestion as cars switch between lanes. With the bike lanes removed the congestion can potentially get worse as people will still ride their bikes on the road but instead of having a personal lane, take up the space of a vehicle. Causing a less safe environment for bikers and more traffic for drivers. Plus the traffic caused by the construction will be way more than the bike lanes will ever cause.\n"
