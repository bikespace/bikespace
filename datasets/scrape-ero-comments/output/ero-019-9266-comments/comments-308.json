They are working to improve things for us. Why aren't you?\nOntario should try to be an example to the world of how things can be. Not taking steps to be regressive and backward.\nVote NO to this legislation or remove it from being proposed altogether. Support what the people of Ontario want - bike lanes!!!\n"

The bike lanes already exist, why would you try to remove them?\nRemoving bike lanes will only result in more cars on the road causing greater congestion and worsening traffic. In addition this will cost lives as bike riders will no longer have protection while riding on busy streets.\nI thought the government was supposed to work for it's people, not kill them.\n"

In other jurisdictions this has been documented many times.  GTA traffic problems are caused by inadequate transit choices and construction. Removing lanes will discourage cycling, encourage the use of polluting vehicles and result in more injuries to and deaths of cyclists.\n"

They will do so either by bike in the main lane (both disruptive and dangerous) or pack the streets in cars.\nThe only way to reduce congestion is to provide a non-car alternative. This is a plainly political waste of time and money.\n"

The province should not involve itself in decisions of the city. It is over reach. Furthermore, requiring the removal of bike lanes by cities is costly and un necessary. If the province wants to control the design of city streets, it should pay for 100% of the construction and maintenance of those streets.\n"

        "comment": "This is a totally unnecessary proposal trying to justify itself with reasoning that is unsupported by data - bike lanes dont cause traffic, cars cause traffic. Construction to remove bike lanes will not only worsen the congestion it claims to address, but will also be a gross waste of resources that could be otherwise used to address actual important problems in municipalities. Even if congestion for cars is marginally improved, there is no disputing that more lives will be put at risk if cyclists are not given access to safe roadways and bike lanes, and road deaths are certain to increase if bike lanes are removed. It is inconceivable that the Ontario government has decided that a few minutes of shorter commuting is worth the loss of human life - shameful and stupid.\n"

Instead of working with municipalities to come to a solution for congestionsDoug the thug is being heavy handed.  Why don\u2019t you concentrate on improving public transportation.

This is a policy that runs contrary to evidence based planning, and is an affront to the democratic system by overruling the elected will of Toronto council, which has a mandate from Torontonians to build and maintain these bike lanes.\nI hope the government is prepared for mass demonstrations and civil disobedience if it moves forward with this plan. The communities who benefit from these bike lanes, and the people who rely on them to travel through the core of the city will not take kindly to this egregious governmental overreach.\nShameful leadership by this government.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are an integral part of the City of Toronto. They allow residents to get wherever they may be going quick and efficiently (not to mention environmentally). The added bike lanes have made it much safer for people to ride their bikes, DECREASING the amount of cars on the road. By removing bike lanes, you are decreasing alternative transport modes and forcing people to take their car and increasing traffic\u2026and that\u2019s just common sense. This bill should be shot down immediately and the Premier should be leaving any municipal roads to the municipal government. If the residents of the  City of Toronto want bike lanes, thats what they deserve. People living in urban areas don\u2019t want to drive 5 min, they want to walk or ride their bike.\n"

You should feel ashamed, but it no seems that you're unable to even feel that anymore.\n"

        "comment": "I implore the government to listen to the experts here. There is no basis in their claim that it is singularly the bike lanes on these three roads causing congestion. There is a complete lack of understand of how proper analysis would and should be carried out. But of course this is beside the point because what is clear is that these lanes are saving lives and moving people quickly down the streets. During rush hour on bloor, 35% of trips are by bike. What happens when the lanes are removed? The following three things are possible 1) these people are now in cars 2) these people take up the full car lane in order to safely bike 3) they add to the already overcrowded Bloor subway line.  Bike lanes provide safety and mobility. They are part of the solution. The removal of existing safety infrastructure is a horrendous act of shortsightedness. If this government is truly concerned with congestion, I beg them to stop mismanaging the backlog of transit projects and take a course in transportation/urban economics to understand how induced demand works with respect to road infrastructure. Further, I am embarrassed and insulted by the government's use of a $200 giveaway in the midst of a housing/health/transit crisis.\n"

Getting rid of bike lanes, makes it unsafe to bike in the city, and makes it more likely people will drive instead. This is nothing more than an attack on the safety of Torontonians, and the intelligence of the people too. Naming it \"reducing gridlock, saving you time act\" does not make it magically work.\n"
