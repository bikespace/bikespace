        "comment": "The construction or removal of bike lanes is not a provincial matter. Politicians should not be the ones making the decision to implement or remove of bike lanes. It should be a municipal decision with traffic experts and city planners. Streets are payed for all and should have space for everyone. This is essentially privatizing streets for cars only. Every person 16yr old and older cannot own a car and the TTC is not enough.  And no, historically streets were not made for cars only. And yes, people can ride in winter. We don't need to reinvent the wheel here, look at succesful cities that have implemented a \"safe for all\" transit policy, including safe lanes for bicycle riders. Furthermore, it is fiscally irresponsable to waste millions of dollars in destroying that which was constructed under a pilot program and previous studies. Bicycle riders have the right to feel save going around the city, including teenagers riding to afterschool activities, seniors riding to get groceries, parents taking their toddler to daycare, etc.\n"

        "comment": "As a long term Ontario resident I am very concerned with this approach both as a car owner and as a bike owner. I feel like this proposal makes it harder for car drivers to safely navigate the city but also increases risks for bikers. With the city bikes expanding more and more of us residents are able to leave the car at home and bike into work because of these bike lanes. Removing them would force me to drive the car into work thus making traffic worse. Please focus on improving transit instead to relieve congestion instead of this approach.\nThank you.\n"

I do not find, as a driver, that there is detriment to my ability to get around Toronto in my car because there are bike lanes on major streets now. Please do not remove any existing bike lanes!\n"

This is a disgusting act of buying votes for an unwanted election that will cost taxpayers; kind of like buying votes with the nonsense 200 dollar cheques to buy votes\n"

        "comment": "As an resident if in Ontario, this act is wholey not in the best interest of the province or its residents.\n1.  Removing bike lanes does not reduce gridlock.  Providing options for ontarioans to get around does.  The province should be building more bike lanes not spending our tax dollars to take out bike lanes (especially lanes that were recently installed. Providing more bike lanes lanes enables residents to bike safely which means they won't interfere with car traffic.  Additionally residents who don't fell safe biking now because of the lack of safe infrastructure will start to cycle, further reducing car traffic.\nFurthermore the province should invest in public transit Providing more options to residents who do not want to or shouldn't be driving.  This would further reduce the number of cars on the road decreasing gridlock.\nRemoving bike lanes is not a decision based on evidence and study.  This law will only serve to make gridlock worse as it restricts residents ability to get around to cars only,  which puts more cars on our already overloaded roads, increasing gridlock.\n2.  Bypassing environmental protections is never in the best interest if residents. In particular future generations of ontarioans as they will have to deal with the long term implications of any infrastructure project we initiate.  Environmental impact may not become obvious until years after a project started or completed, which is why studies are so crucial.\nThe proposed 413, according the government's own studies, would do very little to improve traffic flow.  Anu benofot from it would be short term only.  And is building it is not a good use of our resources.  It is not fiscally responsible.\nA better use of resources would be to improve commuter trains and public transit which are significantly more efficient at moving people around.  Public transit has the added benefit of a smaller environmental impact.\nAlso changing building codes to allow increased density and mixed use neighborhoods would allow ontarioans to live close to where they work.  This would eliminate the need for daily long distance  travel in the first place.\nIn summary.  The current government should stop wasting tax payers money on these non solutions to our problems.  Nom-soloutions that appear to only benefit the construction friends and donors to certain MPPs. Listen to the advice of experts and reports already received.\nDrop this bill and actually spend our money wisely to help all ontarioans.\n"

        "comment": "Dear Mr. Ford,\nRemoving bike lanes from these major streets is something I absolutely do not support.  This policy is going to cost the lives of cyclists and make pedestrian access to these streets more dangerous as well.\nWith the ever increasing use of services like Uber Eats and DoorDash we're seeing more and more people relying on bikes to make a living.  There are far too many businesses on Bloor and Yonge relying on these services, there's no way to reduce the number of cyclists on these streets.  Removing the bike lanes they rely on will force them into the road with the cars, where they'll block traffic and be at significant risk of serious injury, or they'll move to the safer sidewalks putting pedestrians at risk of injury.  Toronto needs bike lanes.\nAs someone who has lived in the Bloor/Yonge area since before the bike lanes were installed I have seen little to no impact to the traffic from the bike lanes.  Adding them did not make traffic worse, the traffic on these streets has always been terrible.  If you want to reduce traffic get cars off the road.  Support bike lanes, support improving transit.  This will become crucial as we continue to densify the city over the coming years.  Catering to cars is not the way forward.\nDo not remove these bike lanes.  Do not block the construction of bike lanes.  Leave city planning to the city planners and the residents.\n"

We fully reject this bill and the spirit behind it. This is endless meddling by the provincial government because of a personal and irrational vendetta by the Premier. The Provincial government should concern itself with provincial matters. Add more bike lanes, do not remove existing. Do not increase red tape and bureaucracy around bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "I'm horrified at this bill and the thought of losing bike lanes that cost money and time to install. It is 2024, and we are experiencing the effects of climate change. Traffic is a disaster because there are too many individual cars on our streets and roads. Public transit is horrifically underfunded and has become unreliable. Nearly 1/3 of Toronto households do not have a car.\nOne of the few notable pieces of progress made toward transportation in Toronto since 2020 has been the installation of bike lanes. They make biking a safer and more accessible alternative to driving.\nIf you remove bike lanes, there will be more cars on the road, and our already overburdened and underfunded public transit will be even more crowded.\nIf you remove bike lanes, you will be contributing further to the devastating impact of climate change and openly demonstrating that you lack the common sense to understand that it is 2024, not 1964. Our needs have changed. Viable alternatives to driving equals fewer cars on the road. Fewer cars on the road equals less traffic congestion, and fewer deaths.\nIf you remove bike lanes, you will be responsible for the increase in deaths that will follow. And you will be seen, rightly, as an embarrassment of a provincial government, stuck in the past, meddling in municipal affairs, and picking on vulnerable road users as a way of airing your weird personal grievance against Toronto.\n"

You will make it worse and make the road network worse.\nSecondly, this is a democracy.

        "comment": "Cars causes traffic. Not bicycle.\nBike lanes fight climate change. They reduce pollution; they are literally a net zero way to get around. Removing bike lanes will put cyclists who came out of their cars thanks to safe bike lanes, back into cars. This proposal will likely cause cyclists to get catastrophically injured and possibly die. It is not evidence based, and is the wrong move in the face of a climate emergency. I am stunned we are talking about removing bike lanes in the year 2024.\nThis is absolutely wrong and should be stopped.|\n"

Everyone behaves much more predictably and whether I am driving, walking or biking I feel much safer with the bike lanes there. The evidence clearly shows bike lanes reduce congestion (which is caused by cars!), increase business, and are a net zero impact to the environment. This is a truly terrible idea that will have horrific consequences when cyclists are injured or killed by drivers. This terribly misguided idea needs to be scrapped immediately.\n"
