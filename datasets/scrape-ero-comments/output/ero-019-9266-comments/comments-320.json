        "comment": "I am a driver and a cyclist in the city of Toronto. Traffic congestion is out of control in this city and I see the negative effects every day.\nHowever, cycling reduces the number of cars on the road, provides a healthier, faster and more sustainable method of transportation for residents of this city. This bill is an overreach by the provincial government and all evidence suggests that it will not have the intended effect of reducing congestion.\nAs a driver, I also feel more comfortable when cyclists have a dedicated lane.\nI believe that we should get rid of on-street parking from main streets and create a system for citizens to report parking violations in order (to improve enforcement). This would reduce congestion without the negative impact of the proposed bill.\n"

Scientific studies have conclusively proven that bike lanes do NOT add to congestion, and they do deliver many important benefits to both the local community and the nation at large. Please rethink the ill-advised plan to remove bike lanes, and help to support expansion of these paths that improve the economy, health, environment, and community of Canadians.\n"

Many studies have shown that bike lanes contribute to a reduction of congestion, furthermore studies have shown bike lanes to result in an increase to businesses on streets with bike lanes. Removal of bike lanes and prevention of future bike lanes will also result in the death of vulnerable road users who will be maimed by vehicles on the road. Do better Ontario.\n"

They are starving because the food system is toppling. They can't breathe because the air in cities chokes them. And you are proposing to remove infrastructure that is a major step in reducing fossil fuel use by cars.  This is the moment to drastically reduce car use and offer people other ways to travel that aren't dependent on releasing carbon into the atmosphere. People commit suicide by trapping themselves in the fumes of cars because cars are poisonous. Why are you pushing to have more poison come from Ontario? I am totally shocked by this short sighted and flagrantly irresponsible proposal. How dare you threaten the future of my children.\n"

        "comment": "I am very concerned about this bill and its impacts. This bill will increase red tape and  create more hurdles for the construction of much needed infrastructure.\nA removal of existing bike lanes will increase traffic as those cyclists who would have felt safe to bike will now resort to cars, increasing congestion in Toronto.\nBike lanes not getting built as a result of these changes will make cycling dangerous for children and increase deaths that are already one too many. Long term this will increase healthcare costs and increase expenditures needed to maintain roads (as more cars would be needed to replace cycles).\nNot everyone can afford cars and food delivery costs would also increase due to an increased need for cars to deliver food.\nTo summarize, the community should be heard and common sense should prevail and this bill should be rejected.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is a shameful waste of taxpayer money!\nThe existence of bike lanes makes it possible for people to SAFELY use their bikes rather than cars on high traffic routes.  Bikes also reduce the load on public transit systems.  This legislation is symptomatic of the Ontario government's continuing obsession to tamper with municipal affairs. This legislation is also clearly targeted at Toronto but will have a chilling effect on other municipalities.\nI live in St. Catharines and we too have bike lanes.  I use them daily.  These lanes are key for cyclists to feel and be safe on the roads.  It also reduces the anxiety that drivers feel when passing a cyclist and there isn't a bike lane.  More people using bicycles will lower the volume of vehicles on our roads.  You can see this at work in places like Copenhagen.\n"

And you barely see any cyclists along these routes.\nBefore drivers could go on either Bloor St. W. or Dundas St. West, now they are only going on Dundas due to the traffic jams caused by these lanes.\nAlso, there has been an increase in traffic around neighbourhood streets because people try to avoid the main roads.\n"

Most of the usage of the bike lanes come from couriers delivering food. These electric vehicles ignore traffic signals, go up on sidewalks when they feel like it and go the wrong way on one way streets. All very dangerous for pedestrians. On rainy days and during the winter the bike lanes are rarely used for other than the couriers.\n"

Removing bike lanes will put cyclists who came out of their cars thanks to safe bike lanes, back into cars. This will make traffic worse! This proposal will likely cause cyclists to get catastrophically injured and possibly die. It is not evidence based, and is the wrong move in the face of a climate emergency. I am stunned we are talking about removing bike lanes in the year 2024.\nThis is absolutely wrong and should be stopped.\n"

        "comment": "Before the province creates new tools it should be leveraging the tools it already has.\nThe roads have more than enough room to accommodate safe driving - unfortunately, due to lack of highway traffic act enforcement and out of control construction projects - congestion has never been worse than now.\nFurther, the government of Ontario needs to complete and close the books two major transit projects (Ontario line, Eglinton LRT) before even considering building new highway infrastructure. Highway 413 is a highway NO VOTING CITIZEN wants and most certainly doesn't need.\nMoreover, the bike lanes in Toronto belong to Toronto. The Ontario government represents the people, to suggest the people of Toronto don't want bike lanes is egregiously arrogant especially since not a single member of provincial legislature uses them.\nStay in your lane. I do NOT support this bill.\n"

        "comment": "I commute to work by bike plus volunteer with my neighbourhood's \"bike bus\": a group of students who bike to and from school together with adult accompaniment.\nRemoving safe routes will kill the bike bus. That's more parents having to drive their kids to and from school or turning a 10 minute ride into a 30 minute walk. For those that drive, it's more cars crowding into already-over-congested pickup and drop-off areas, slowing everyone down and increasing the danger to kids.\nI'll probably go back to driving to work, so you're putting another car on the road. And if I do continue biking  I'll do what's legal and recommended: Take the whole lane.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is an enormous mismanagement of priorities from the province lead by the Ford government. The cities in Ontario are suffering from a huge deficit of transportation availability, rather than focusing on increasing public transit and giving people of large cities more options of transportation this bill cripples many who do not have access to a car. This bill grossly favours people who have access to cars. Bike lanes provide a safe infrastructure for alternative transportation for people who don't drive or don't want to drive. Every bicycle on the street is a car not on the road, there are only benefits of increasing bicycle infrastructure, it is better for the environment, it is an active method of transportation that is better for the citizens of Ontario.\nIn Toronto just this year there have been 6 cyclists death and 12 pedestrian deaths, increasing car density will only increase the casualties. The province should be more focused on delivering mass transit to reach large urban centers like Toronto. Time after time it has been scientifically proven that adding more lanes in cars doesn't decrease traffic, if that were the case then 401 would be the most efficient highway in the world. This bill is very ill informed and it has no benefits to any road users, it definitely won't reduce gridlock nor will it save anyone time. It will do the opposite of that and the cost will be bore by the vulnerable road users like cyclists and pedestrians with their lives. The roads aren't exclusive to just cars. It should be thought of it as being useful for everyone.\n"

        "comment": "A few months ago I was riding my bike on church street in downtown Toronto to commute to work when I fell off my bike when my bike wheel got stuck in a street car track. I hurt my needs really badly and a passerby had to stop to help me move away from the middle of the street. I had to Uber home with the help of my partner and could not walk or stand on my feet for days. Even after a few months now my knees are still in pain. Have there been bike lanes placed in church and Wellesley street area I wouldn't have had to cause irreparable damage to my knees. Downtown Toronto is bike friendly, not the most bike friendly but bike friendly enough that someone like me who relies on bikes as the main form of commute have decided to move here. I believe policies should encourage people to live healthier lives. I get my daily dose of exercise through biking but with removal of bike lanes and with my negative experience of biking on non-bike lane roads, I don't know if I can continue biking. Biking is exercise and thus beneficial for one's health, it is affordable, and it helps the environment by not adding to the air, light, and noise pollution. Policies should help maintain and increase such nobel activities as opposed to stopping them\n"

Billions were spent in the creation of these new bike lanes and time and inconvenience was taken away from the Toronto citizens during the installation. The Ford government trying to take away bike lanes and further putting the roads under stress through the construction required to remove the lanes is unacceptable and a complete waste of Ontarian dollars. This should be under the jurisdiction of the municipality and not the Premier. REMOVING BIKE LANES WILL NOT INCREASE THE QUALITY OF TORONTORIANS AND WILL DEFINITELY NOT HELP WITH TRAFFIC CONGESTION.\n"

Toronto residents have had ample opportunities over several years to participate in forums, debates and decision-making prior to the establishment of these bike lanes, and there is no credible evidence to back up Premier Ford's claims that they are a cause of gridlock. Bike lanes keep cars off the roads, and promote positive health and environmental outcomes.\nI am a daily pedestrian on a street with bike lanes, and I am also a driver. I appreciate the enhanced safety bike lanes offer to everyone involved.\nI urge the Premier to spend his time on much more important matters that fall more clearly under provincial responsibilities and priorites.\n"
