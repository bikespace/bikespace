        "comment": "This proposed legislation is both idiotic and anti-democratic in intent. Idiotic because the intended target - congestion - will only be reduced by the encouragement of public transit and non-car alternatives. This proposal goes in the opposite direction. Anti-democratic, because it involves the use of provincial power to interfere with the traffic decisions of municipalities. Decisions by the people most affected can be over-ridden by bureaucrats and politicians who are both distant from and ill-informed about the problems being addressed.\nAnd this consultation process seems to be a sham, not least because the government fails to provide any justification worth the name for the proposed measure. How about a study of the interaction between bicycle lanes and overall transportation? Nothing like that. Too difficult, So we will stick to legislation by gut feeling.\n"

        "comment": "The proposed law is an egregious overreach by the provincial government into matters that should be decided on SOLELY by municipal governments.\nNot only that, but the proposal to limit or even remove bike lanes will endanger not only cyclists, also pedestrians and even motorists due to the loss of the traffic calming effect provided by bike lanes. Business along streets that either have bike lane plans cancelled or have existing bike lanes removed will also suffer; contrary to common rhetoric, businesses benefit from bike lanes. This has been confirmed by numerous academic studies, and the Bloor-Annex Business Improvement Area has already called this proposal \"disastrous.\"\nThis proposal won't even accomplish its stated of reducing motor vehicle congestion -  in fact, it will accomplish the opposite. In areas where safe bike infrastructure exists, cyclist volumes increase. These cyclists are often switching from driving to cycling, reducing the number of cars on the road. If bike lanes are cancelled or removed, these cyclists (or potential cyclists) will simply choose to drive if they don't feel safe on their bikes. And removing bike lanes won't speed up traffic - we've known since at least the 1930s about the phenomenon of induced demand and we've seen that phenomenon in action over and over again. The 401 is 18 lanes wide in certain parts (and needless to say, doesn't have bike lanes!) and is still constantly backed up. \"One more lane\" never actually fixes anything.\nYou lost the mayoral election you ran in A DECADE AGO now, Doug. It's time to either get over it, or try running for mayor again if you want the job THAT badly. And remember, Doug: The only solution to car traffic is viable alternatives to driving.\n"

        "comment": "The \"Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024\" promises to tackle traffic congestion, but its misguided approach reveals a deep-seated preference for automobiles over sustainable transportation options. This legislation prioritizes cars at the expense of bike lanes, fundamentally undermining efforts to create safer, more accessible urban environments.\nA Short-Sighted Vision\nFirst and foremost, this act reflects a woefully short-sighted vision of urban transportation. By removing bike lanes to accommodate more vehicles, it perpetuates the very gridlock it claims to address. Traffic congestion is not merely a result of the number of lanes available; it\u2019s a complex issue exacerbated by urban planning that favors cars over alternative modes of transport. In an era where climate change poses an existential threat, the focus on expanding road capacity for cars is nothing short of irresponsible.\nDismantling Progress\nThis legislation is a blatant step backward in the fight for greener cities. Bike lanes are not just painted lines on the road; they represent a commitment to public health, environmental sustainability, and active living. Removing these lanes in favor of cars signals a disregard for the safety and well-being of cyclists and pedestrians. Cities around the world are investing in cycling infrastructure to reduce carbon footprints and promote healthier lifestyles, while this act seems to be dragging us back into the fossil-fueled past.\nIgnoring the Evidence\nNumerous studies demonstrate that bike lanes can alleviate traffic congestion by encouraging more people to cycle, thus reducing the number of cars on the road. By ignoring this evidence, the act not only undermines public safety but also neglects the benefits of cycling as a viable form of transportation. Instead of fostering a culture of cycling, this legislation sends a clear message that cars reign supreme\u2014a dangerous precedent for urban development.\nA False Sense of Progress\nThe name of the act itself is misleading. \u201cReducing Gridlock\u201d implies a thoughtful, innovative approach to urban planning, but the reality is far from it. Prioritizing cars over cyclists and pedestrians creates a false sense of progress, one that merely shifts the burden of congestion rather than solving it. This act fails to recognize that a successful transportation policy must be inclusive, accommodating diverse modes of transport rather than privileging one at the expense of others.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, the \"Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024\" is an ill-conceived piece of legislation that champions cars while sacrificing the safety and well-being of cyclists. It represents a regressive step in urban planning and a significant setback in the fight against climate change. By undermining efforts to promote cycling, this act not only fails to deliver on its promises but actively works against the creation of sustainable, vibrant urban spaces. It\u2019s time to demand better from our lawmakers\u2014legislation that truly prioritizes all modes of transportation, not just those that fit comfortably within the confines of an outdated car-centric mentality.\n"

        "comment": "I disagree with the proposal to require municipalities to seek provincial approval to build a new bike lane if it requires the removal of a vehicle lane and to require reporting on existing bike lanes on two main points. The first is that as a society, we need to be facilitating transportation that reduces greenhouse gas emissions not creating barriers for those alternatives. I am a driver and a cyclist and I accept that as we transition to roads and pathways that don't always prioritize cars, car trips may take a little longer. This is a sacrifice I'm willing to make as a driver to create safe and healthy transportation alternatives. The second is that I believe this is an overreach by the province into municipal decision-making. I live in Ottawa and don't want the Ontario government dictating decisions on city bike lanes that my municipal representatives are capable of making and have much more relevant local knowledge regarding.\n"

Rather, they help reduce single occupancy vehicles on our roads, reducing congestion. We should be building more, better bike infrastructure to encourage and support people in using other forms of travel, both to reduce congestion and as part of our strategy to mitigate the negative effects of climate change. Requiring Ministerial review and approval of any bike lanes that reduce car travel lanes will increase the cost, time and energy needed to move ahead with active transportation projects. That's exactly the opposite direction from where we need to be headed.\nSecondly, this chill on bike lane installation is a direct attack on the physical safety of people who choose to travel by bike. Well designed bike lanes not only clarify and streamline different road uses, they keep people safe. There have already been too many deaths and serious injuries for people on bikes. This bill will only make the risks worse.\nThirdly, this proposal paves the way for unjustified overreach into municipal jurisdictions. Municipalities have the right and the responsibility to develop their own transportation plans, in consultation with their citizens. The province has no business interfering in these plans.\n"

My environmental concerns are the following:\n1) this proposal will ensure fewer people ride their bikes in Ontario cities because they will feel unsafe.

This will increase traffic and cause worse air pollution from GHG emissions.\n3) Potentially destroying bike lanes will lead to air pollution from the construction required to remove them.\n4) Constantly pitting drivers and cyclists against each other leads to an antagonistic atmosphere, where drivers feel they don't have to worry about the safety of cyclists or about sharing the road. This will lead to a fundamentally unsafe environment where more cyclists will die in collisions with drivers.\nI am appalled at the lack of research in this proposal and further appalled that the leaders in my province seem to be so uncaring about people's lives.

Section 2 of the Act provides an exemption from the Environmental Assessment Act for enterprises, activities, proposals, plans and programs for or related to Highway 413, including the Highway 413 Project and the Highway 413 early works projects.\"\nI am 100% against this.\nThis highway would not be built if it underwent an environmental assessment, and that's why you don't want to do it. According to your own documentation, it would put 11 species at risk in danger of extinction (https://thenarwhal.ca/highway-413-endangered-species/). It also threatens three conservation lands (https://thenarwhal.ca/ontario-highway-413-trca-land/). The preliminary Federal government response highlighted dangers to species at risk, wildlife corridors, and rivers (run off from road salt). It also highlighted key information missing, and lack of consultation with Indigenous peoples (https://thenarwhal.ca/highway-413-federal-feedback/). There also hasn't been sufficient consideration of the impacts of air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.\nHighway 413 would run through the Greenbelt, which your government knows well the people of Ontario love and want preserved.\nWe can't eat pavement, though. We can't breathe it, and can't drink it either. Animals can't live on. And humans are also animals! We can't live on paved highway. Air, water, food, and housing are all more valuable and important than pavement. The job of government is to protect the environment for current and future generations, not to destroy them forever.\n\"Recognizes the need to priority highways faster... To get people and goods out of gridlock...\"\nThe premise of this regulation isn't back by data. Adding road capacity won't necessarily reduce gridlock because of induced demand. The new road infrastructure just attracts more and more people to drive on it as it becomes known, and then you just have gridlock in a new place. Gridlock is caused by too many single-vehicle cars on the roads. To reduce it, you need to invest in alternatives such trains and buses. Then you need to charge drivers to use highways at peak times, thus providing an incentive to get on those trains and buses instead.\n\"Recognizes that accidents and lane closures can worsen traffic congestion and impact the quality of life of Ontarians.\"\nAccidents don't just affect \"quality of life\"; they can disable and kill people. Cyclists and pedestrians are at much great risk than people in cars, so they need greater protection.\nI am in favor of \"speeding up the delivery of broadband projects to provide all Ontarians with reliable internet access.\" This is good and should be done.\n\"Building Highway 413, recognizing the importance of this highway to millions of drivers from across Ontario.\"\nI do not agree that drivers are more important than people who do not drive. In fact, non-drivers includes the most vulnerable of the province, and therefore more in need of government assistance than drivers: children and teenagers, the elderly who have lost their license (or never had it), Ontarians with disabilities that prevent them driving, low-income Ontarians who cannot afford a car. Furthermore, any other Ontarian who has chosen not to drive is as important those who do.\nThe route proposed for the 413 would pollute critical watersheds, pave over 2000 acres of prime farmland, and threaten critically endangered species. It will destroy wetlands that prevent basements from flooding. In all these ways, building this highway will make life worse for Ontarians and indeed for everyone else in the world.\nFarmland is one of Ontario\u2019s greatest assets, supporting an agricultural sector that provides 70,000 jobs and contributes more than $10 billion a year to provincial GDP. Highway 413 will permanently destroy parts of this important industry. This is particularly alarming given that climate change increases the possibility of food shortages in the future. In this way as well, the highway does more to damage than assist the people of Ontario.\nRe: the Proposal for municipalities to get approval from the province for new bike lanes that require removal of a lane of traffic and asking or \"compelling\" municipalities to provide data about existing bike lanes where this has happened, to \"get drivers where they need to go faster\". I am 100% against this idea.\n\u2022 This is a huge waste of tax dollars at both the provincial and municipal levels. I do not agree with my tax money going to paying ministry staff to micro-manage bike lanes in every single municipality in the province,  or to municipal staff wasting their time compiling or gathering data about past decisions.\n\t\u2022 It is anti-democratic and greatly reduces the ability of Ontarians to provide input. Municipal politicians are easy to contact for everyone to give their opinion about existing and proposed bike lanes. That responsibility moving to the provincial level is much less accessible. The ministry of transportation could be so deluged by messages about bike lanes by citizens from every part of the province that they won't be able to respond to them all the way municipal politicians can. Citizens can easily attend and speak at local council meetings. They cannot easily (or at all!) getting standing to speak in the Ontario Legislature.\n\t\u2022 First of all, bike lanes don't always increase traffic congestion - see https://www.cbc.ca/news/science/bike-lanes-impacts-1.7358319. If they're not in a dedicated bike lane, they might still be on the side of the road, and they are allowed right in the car lane, in fact.\n\t\u2022 Reducing bike lanes discriminates against people who aren't as comfortable riding right beside cars, which are often women, children, older people. These folks might then end up on sidewalks more, which endangers pedestrians.\n\t\u2022 I don't agree that the drivers getting where they need to go faster is always a good thing. Bike lanes that slow drivers down might be annoying, but if they save lives, isn't that more important? What municipal politicians say they hear the most about is unsafe drivers. People in Ontario do care more about lives than driver speed. You are out of touch with what your citizens want.\n\t\u2022 It will make all of our cities worse. Provincial politicians are not intimately familiar with the road structure of every municipality in Ontario. That's why they aren't in charge of local roads. They cannot possibly make better calls of what's better for every city in Ontario in terms of overall road infrastructure than the actual experts on this matter, local municipal politicians and staff. (Note that Bloor Annex BIA has made a statement in favor of the controversial bike lanes there.)\n\t\u2022 This whole thing seems to be prompted by three specific by bike lanes in Toronto. Ontario is more than Toronto, and the entire province should not be made to suffer in a bureaucratic nightmare just because the Premier and the Minister of Transportation happen to be from the Toronto area and to care much more about what happens there than they do about the rest of the province. Set up a meeting with Mayor Chow and keep the rest of us out of your little local dispute.\n"
