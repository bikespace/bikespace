Re-evaluating them at a provincial level is pointless. Let cities and municipalities make the decisions, not the province.\nYou want to make congestion better; how about making transit better; or what about this; increase housing so people actually work where they live; then people will walk and take more transit; thus reducing gridlock.\n"

        "comment": "I believe that it is extremely short sighted to blame the increase in traffic on bike lanes rather than on insufficient infrastructure investment during extreme population growth. The only solution to traffic is having viable alternatives to driving.\nEvery bike in a bike lane is a car off the road. Having people on bikes requires a connected grid of bike lanes to get people where they need to go.\nWe need to invest in non car infrastructure to get Ontario into the 21st century instead of chasing 1950 pipe dream ideas that will only add to the millions of cars clogging our roads.\nElectrify GO. Expand transit options. Invest in active transportation. Remove on street parking on main roads during rush hour. Allow transit to have signal priority and separated lanes so our busses aren\u2019t stuck in traffic.\nThe solutions are out there. Learn from other cities globally.\n"

Their locations are carefully chosen, with consideration given to traffic flow and cyclist safety. Bike lanes are also an important part of curbing dependence on cars in urban areas.\nThe Provincial government is overextended its reach with this legislation. Please leave the decision regarding Bike lanes with municipalities, where it belongs.\n"

        "comment": "This bill a provincial overstep and a completely backwards logic if the province cares about road safety and climate change. We must stop car-centric development and shift away from the current status quo of providing road space solely for drivers. Moreover, municipalities are the ones conducting studies and consultations within their communities, as a result, local transportation units are best suited to knowing where and when bike lanes should be created. The province (who is not on the ground and has little understanding of local streets) does not have the expertise to make the decisions necessary when it comes to complete streets. Moreover, this bill would make it nearly impossible to build bikeways and delay the process exponentially, costing us lives and money in the long run.\n"

        "comment": "As someone who has professional experience, and has worked in traffic management, this proposal is a mistake. If the desire is to reduce traffic and congestion it will fail at its goal. The purpose of bike lanes is to give people viable alternatives to cars, so fewer people drive. We cannot make more roads in already developed areas. If you would like to reduce congestion, invest in improving public transportation so that it is an attractive alternative to driving for more people instead of wasting mine and Ontario taxpayers dollars to push a hunch. The reason there is more congestion is that the population is growing regionally, and government is not improving transportation, plus we are having major construction projects as much of our infrastructure has not been maintained for years, and now needs fixing.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lane are a growing necessity in large cities.  As city traffic grows due to rising populations and workforce more people will be commuting. It does not make sense to clog those roads with large vehicles with only one person in them when there can easily be four to six bicycle riders in the same footprint.  These riders also do not emit toxic fumes and do not contribute carbon dioxide to the atmosphere whereas a vehicle does, whether it is moving or not.\nThere are also side benefits for the health of the population.  This is needed due to the current defunding of the public health system so that private health care can make more profit by pushing unnecessary services upon venerable people.\n"

        "comment": "Hello!\nWe support bike lanes.\nWe know from evidence that bike lanes help to:\n- reduce gridlock\n- reduce greenhouse gases\n- get people moving faster\nBike lanes are not just a matter of convenience; they are vital for many residents who rely on affordable transportation options. Delivery drivers, including those in food and courier services, as well as individuals who simply cannot afford vehicles due to the high cost of living, depend on both public transportation and bike lanes to move around the city. The rising cost of living has made car ownership unattainable for many, further highlighting the need for equitable, accessible alternatives like cycling infrastructure.\nWe must also recognize that traffic congestion is self-perpetuating. More cars on the road lead to more traffic. It\u2019s a cycle that anyone who takes a moment to reflect on the situation would easily understand. Expanding bike lanes offers an opportunity to break this cycle by encouraging more people to use alternative modes of transport, thereby reducing overall congestion and improving the flow of traffic for everyone.\nBike lanes do not cause gridlock, cars cause gridlock. Without bike lanes, not only are bicycles forced to forfeit their safety by sharing active traffic lanes with cars, the result is that entire lane must now match the (likely lower) speed of the bicycle.\nInvesting in safe, accessible bike infrastructure is essential for the health, safety, and well-being of our communities, as well as for addressing the city\u2019s pressing environmental and transportation challenges. These actions are not only distractions from the real needs of our city but also betray a lack of vision and leadership when it comes to addressing urban challenges. Bike lanes are a practical, immediate step that can provide tangible benefits for Ontario residents, but we need all levels of government working together, in good faith, to make them a reality.\nWe need a government that supports making decisions that are based in evidence.\nL1V0E9\n"

        "comment": "The data is there for everyone to see. Adding bike lanes to a road converts drivers into cyclists and reduces the number of vehicle trips on a given stretch of road, full stop.  Just like you wouldn't drive somewhere that is a few minutes walk away, you wouldn't drive somewhere that is a few minutes bike ride away.\nStudies have shown that:\n1) Cyclists and pedestrians spend more on local businesses over time than drivers do.\n2) induced demand will fill any number of vehicle lanes with vehicles when they are added.\n3) Road diets (reducing number of vehicle lanes) improves traffic flow, reduces congestion, and reduces the number of vehicle accidents on a road\n4) The only way to get people out of cars and to reduce congestion is to provide reasonable alternatives to driving. The only reasonable bike lane is one that's connected to infrastructure and local businesses.\n5) Connecting bicycles to public transit further reduces reliance on the automobile\n6) Bicycles are far more efficient than vehicles at moving people\n7) A report by the UK's Department for Transport suggests that around 20-30% of emergency response activity is related to road traffic collisions.  By reducing traffic variability and speed, we inherently reduce traffic collisions which not only improve traffic, but also reduce burden on our emergency response.\n8) 39% of all trips taken in Ontario are under 5km in length, and between 80-90% of those trips are taken by car. If we provide reasonable alternatives, we could immediately reduce 32-36% of all vehicle traffic by encouraging a shift to more efficient transit for all trips under 5km\nThe answers are already there for us to see. Every study ever done on this topic has always concluded the same: bicycle lanes reduce congestion in the long run. Personal automobiles are inefficient at moving people in city settings.\nPlease, listen to the scientific, evidence based data and allow municipalities to install bicycle lanes that will increase efficiency, boost local business, reduce greenhouse gases, reduce healthcare burden, reduce gridlock, and make cities the safe, wonderful places we call home\n"

The idea that these few lanes will fix car congestion is either deluded or a cynical political wedge issue. Furthermore, the removal of established bike lanes and added red tape on new ones is likely, at some point, going to result in the unnecessary death of ordinary Toronto working people.

        "comment": "I absolutely do not agree with this act for three main reasons.\nThe first reason being that bike lanes are an important part of transportation, especially in a city as large, dense, and urban as Toronto. If these bike lanes are removed, even if it incentivizes just a couple of cyclists to start driving, that would cause an INCREASE in traffic, which is quite the opposite of the goal of this bill. The province should be encouraging bike lanes wherever possible, the more people on bikes, the less people in cars, therefore, less traffic.\nThe second reason is that it is not the duty of the provincial government to meddle in the affairs of municipalities and cities. This is not an efficient use of time of the provincial government, which could be used towards initiatives that would benefit the province as a whole.\nThe third reason is that this is such an egregious use of money. Why use money to reverse (beneficial) infrastructure that has already been installed, when this money could be used towards things that would actually be useful for the province, such as spending money on healthcare or improving infrastructure to accommodate the large growth of population.\n"

Again, the province supports one mode of transportation (the mode that causes environmental problems, safety issues to vulnerable road users).\nThis act is wrong, streets designed for vehicles create hostile environment for kids, elderly people, and those with accessibility issues.\nMy message will probably won't make any changes, just know that if you choose to pass it, you're literally increasing the chances of my kids to get hurt. You're pushing the time when I'll feel safe sending them by themselves to enjoy being outside independently. It would cause more cyclists deaths in streets that are already dangerous for them.\nYou should be investing time and money (public money, right?) in creating more sustainable and equal modes of transport such transit and push people to use this instead preferring yet again CARS. There are cheap and quick solutions you can implement that will support that (marking bus lanes would be one of them). You'll solve your so called \"gridlock\" by supporting people using different kinds of modes and not prioritizing cars (which is what Ontario was so good in doing in the past decades and look where it got us).\nBIKE LANES CREATE SAFE ENVIRONMENT FOR EVERYONE.\n"
