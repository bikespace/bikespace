        "comment": "This is ridiculous. This is a step back in time. Take a good look at any city that functions smoothly and you'll see a diverse set of mobility options for road users that include cycle tracks, wide sidewalks, priority transit lanes, and cars get pinched out given their large volume for density ratio as road users. It's data proven, it's better for people, the environment, for the economy. Cycle lanes, and improving cities to become less car centric and more resilient by one's own two feet is the future. anyone who thinks a mega 413 highway will save Ontario and that removing integral bike lanes that save lives every year that protect vulnerable road users is showing how ignorant they are to the root of the problem and should really take a closer look at where their bias is. I would like to note that I am not a cyclist. I do not care about bikes, I care about people and this city. Cars are the problem, they've always been the problem.\n"

        "comment": "I\u2019m a regular commuter into Toronto via car from the Hamilton area, I am very concerned with the provinces announcement to remove bike lanes from city streets.\nRemoving bike lanes means I will be sharing lanes with bikes putting cyclists at risk of injury and death and making my commute to work more stressful than it is already (it\u2019s very stressful) and more dangerous for Torontonians who rely on biking infrastructure to get from A to B. I do not want the experience of injuring a person on my commute.\nAs a driver,  I am extremely concerned and alarmed that the province is choosing NOT to focus on the transit projects within their purview and remove valuable safety and transportation infrastructure. I do not want to drive into the city but feel this is my only option as a night economy worker who has been priced out of living in the city as Metrolinx does not run at times when I am returning home from work. Compounded, it does not run on time when I am able to travel during operating hours from the Hamilton area.\nIf the province is interested in helping reduce commuting, the focus needs to be on commuter TRANSIT not the removal of municipal bike lanes and infrastructure.\n"

For example when there is a TTC emergency and people flood out onto Bloor Street in Toronto, there are insufficient lanes for taxi and bus service to move people around.  Likewise in an evacuation situation (think back to 911 when the downtown had to be evacuated as a precaution), our roads need to be able to flow.\n"

Particularly for how much of car lanes might be exclusive for folks out of town?? If anything, bike lanes really are car infrastructure so that cars don't have to worry about bikes in their lanes. The amount of bike lanes actually having a substantial impact on traffic is ridiculous. Besides that more lanes are likely to only induce demand. Alas.\n"

Real constituents across Bloor, from the Annex to Bloor Court to Bloordale to Bloor West Village have asked for this. As constituents, our needs matter. We should be investing in forward thinking infrastructure, and NOT going back to supporting fossil fuels in 2024. Unbelievable. Not only that, but bike lanes literally contribute to local businesses because it is easier to stop, 'park' and support.\n"

Kids, Seniors, people with groceries, contractors with equipment, can not take bikes. Additionally bikes are totally impractical in rain or snow.\nThe city has been knowingly propagating false data from organizations such as \"Active TO\" to promote the bike lanes. They would be very lucky if the provinicial government did not sue them for the entire cost to remove the bike lanes.\nCurrently, I spend 1 additional hour in traffic everyday, as opposed to before the bike lanes were installed. Removing the lanes will save tens of thousands of people everyday about an hour, resulting and a better quality of life and higher productivity.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly disagree with the Bill 212 proposal and believe removing or reducing the number of bike lanes will NOT improve traffic and car congestion at all. All traffic studies and subject matter experts state that having more transit options is the best way to improve congestion, and one of these options is having a good biking infrastructure.\nAs a driver in Toronto I feel the most comfortable driving on streets that have bike lanes. And most of the times traffic is jammed by other drivers stopping where it's not allowed (for example ride sharing, food delivery), multiple construction sites on major arterial roads, and a lack of strong enforcement of road legislation.\nWhen drivers stop right at the intersection corner to grab a coffee, in front of the no stopping sign, and the passing police doesn't do anything about it, then drivers will not want to obey traffic rules and think they can get away with anything.\nThat is why we need these bike lanes to reduce the number of cars on the streets, increased traffic laws enforcement for both drivers and bicyclists, and better coordination of construction sites that impact everyone.\n"

        "comment": "This is ridiculous. This legislation will either deny municipalities the tools to combat gridlock and make streets safer for Ontarians, or will just be another layer of approval. Either way, this will make government less effective by adding more red tape.\nWe know bike lanes decrease traffic by reducing the amount of weaving and making streets safer. They have higher throughput than motor vehicle lanes and require less maintenance. Bicycle lanes also support small business. Bicyclists are more likely to stop and shop than car drivers, and streets with cycle tracks see higher economic activity.\nThis legislation is anti-business, promotes red tape, makes Ontario more dangerous, and will increase traffic and road costs. I strongly encourage the Legislature to reject this bill.\n"

        "comment": "- I thought the government of Ontario was aiming to reduce bureaucracy. Why is it adding a layer of bureaucracy to a process that can very well be done at the municipal level?\n- The removal of existing lanes is a step backwards, and a costly one. Transportation infrastructure is part of a network. A bike lane may not be used as frequently as desired because it is not connected to other bike friendly roads and therefore remains hard to access. The data you collect today may increase significantly if a connection is added. We need to strengthen the network, not weaken it.\n- The removal of existing land is probably not going to help reach ANY of the objectives of the framework.\n- Invest in youth, allow them to ride safely to their jobs, sports activities, school, grandparents. Make them autonomous and support a bright future for ON.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is contrary to climate change goals and the needs of the public. Public safety is paramount and the removal of bicycle lanes is not in line with planning or engineering best practice for transportation public safety. Why are we moving away from a complete streets design to prioritizing vehicular infrastructure when complete streets benefits everyone and this bill only represents one road user?\nWhen planners consider where to put bicycle lanes they are also trying to balance traffic congestion. Bike lanes are not the problem.  Cyclists actually remove cars from the road, reducing congestion while increasing road safety. On the other hand, removing bicycle lanes represents a significant safety issue for cyclists who will continue to use this mode of transportation but not have their safety considered. We need to be prioritizing alternate forms of transportation, our corridors are only so wide and it\u2019s short sighted to assume vehicular transportation is the only one that will matter in future.\nIn addition, municipalities should have the opportunity and ability to set service levels and ask their residents what they want and are willing to pay for. The province should not be mandating the removal of significant infrastructure, those decisions should be in the hands of the municipality and Council. This bill is short sighted and is proposing to destroy infrastructure that\u2019s been built up over the past decade without doing significant consultation to ensure this is the correct decision for municipalities.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes does not save time or reduce gridlock, nor does it protect cyclists. In fact, taking away bike lanes has been shown to increase traffic congestion. When there's no dedicated space for cyclists, they end up sharing lanes with vehicles, which slows down everyone on the road due to the varied speeds of cars and bikes. Studies also indicate that bike lanes streamline traffic flow, as cars don't need to make frequent stops or lane changes to avoid cyclists.\nMoreover, removing bike lanes makes streets more dangerous. Bike lanes provide a critical buffer that reduces the risk of accidents by giving cyclists a designated, safer area away from cars.\nWithout bike lanes, cyclists face a higher risk of being injured or killed in collisions, which not only endangers lives but can lead to more disruptions due to accident investigations and emergency\n"
