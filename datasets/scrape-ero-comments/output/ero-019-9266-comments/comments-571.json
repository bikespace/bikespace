Canada is stuck in a progressive circular decline of increasing tarmac leading to increasing number of cars requiring increasing tarmac. Break the cycle and build cycle lanes! Discourage car use (low emmission zones, impose a tax or fine for use of vehicles in city centers, increase public transport use with government subsidies, etc). As a wider-reaching example, if money was spent improving and subsidising rain transport between Waterloo/Kitchener and Toronto, there would be no more 401 gridlock.\n"

        "comment": "Our 4 member family lives in Toronto and we all use bikes to commute to school and work.\nParked cars, construction, deliveries, Uber pickups and drop offs are bigger sources of congestion than bike lanes.\nIf bike lanes are removed, cyclists will need to share the same lane with cars, causing greater congestion for drivers and endangering lives.\nGlobal megacities like Paris and NYC are all increasing bike lanes for the benefit of their citizens. How is it that experts (who actually study the data) all across the world support bike lanes, but the Premier knows better? And why rush ahead without waiting for any up-to-date evidence to inform policy decisions?\nMunicipal governments have the competence and data analyses to make the correct decisions regarding bike lanes. The provincial government should focus on its areas of responsibility, such as health and education.\n"

Each level of government must stick to its own area of responsibility and not interfere with other levels of government. This should be enough to change the country's constitution to prohibit this kind of brutality.\nAside from the absurdity of the interference, at this point in history any decision should be data-driven, which this bill is far from being. It shows how incompetent and unprofessional this cabinet is.\nThe bill ignores the fact that between 7% and 8% of commuters use bicycles in the areas mentioned by the Ministry in the media, and ignores the health benefits of bicycling, considering that only 15% to 20% of Canadians meet physical activity recommendations.\nI would like to recommend that the provincial government of Ontario only take care of provincial matters and do so with knowledge and professionalism.\n"

When you get rid of the bike lanes, you would also need to get rid of the dedicated left turn lane that happens before an intersection, just to have two traffic lanes. Unless this proposal plans on banning left turns on these roads, this is just going to create more traffic behind left turning cars.\n"

Anyone who has travelled any where outside North America will notice that bicycles and bicycle lanes are a popular, healthy  and effective way of commuting. Cycling needs to be safe and supported by our government. It is  dangerous to ride on streets without bike lanes.  If you build the bike lanes people will use them. Ontario need to look forward in a progressive way and build an even stronger cycling network, rather than this backwards proposal!\n"

It is another conservative policy decision not based on data, financial acuity, public safety, environmental stewardship, or what Toronto taxpayers and voters have supported. Instead it is a policy to ensure that your friends and supporters who still live in the bubble of the 1970's where more cars, more traffic, more pollution were a sign of progress and success win.\nMr.Ford your policy will do nothing but cause harm for the city of Toronto. Your policy will cost Ontario taxpayers at least an estimated $48 M dollars- money that cold be better used of providing food for the homeless and children. The additional costs for the development and construction of new bike lanes is not known. More misuse of Ontario and Toronto taxpayers. Reducing bike lanes will increase congestion and reduce safety. What is the point!\nI am begging you and your cabinet members to reconsider your legislation and really listen to what Toronto citizens want.\n"

The cost is too high, both in dollars and in loss of safety for cyclists.\nBike lanes should be an essential part of city streets. This provincial government is doing next to nothing on the impending crisis of climate change. Bike lanes are an excellent way to encourage people to curtail their use of  fossil fuels.\nWhen I'm driving, I prefer to have special lanes for cyclists. That way I know where they are and I don't have to slow down to accommodate them.\nBefore blaming bike lanes for all traffic woes, maybe it's time to prohibit condo builders from blocking a full lane of traffic for extended periods of time during construction.\n"

We should not be encouraging more cars downtown. As someone who lives and works in this area in question, I feel strongly that we need to stick with the project as planned.\nFrom my personal experience commuting through this area everyday by foot, bus, or car, I do not think the bicycle lanes are the reason for the worsening car traffic. Lanes blocked for various construction projects (condo developments and roadwork such as water pipes) were a much more significant cause.\nPlease stop plans to waste taxpayer dollars by building and then dismantling stuff.\n"

And thank you Councillors Saxe and Morley for your clear opposition to Bill 212 with item MM23.14. Toronto has made so much progress in building safe and protected cycling infrastructure over the last several years. But so much of that progress could soon be undone, all at once.\nAs of November 12th, 18,796 people have signed Cycle Toronto\u2019s petition asking the province to stay in their own lane.\nAn open letter from 120 physicians and researchers is clear: \u201cLegislation proposing to guide road design decisions, such as Bill 212, should explicitly place a higher priority on road safety than motor vehicle travel times. We oppose the proposed legislation as currently written\u2026\u201d\nMayor Chow, as you continue to review the city's options, I\u2019m urging for you and City Council to:\n1) Pass a motion at City Council this week conveying its opposition to the Provincial government's Bill 212, and request the Province of Ontario to maintain municipal jurisdiction with respect to the installation and removal of bike lanes\n2) Direct the General Manager of Transportation Services and Director of Planning, Design and Management to make a formal, data-driven submission to the Standing Committee on Heritage, Infrastructure and Cultural Policy, Minister Sarkaria, and Premier Ford following the Ontario Professional Planners Institute\u2019s statement that Bill 212 is a move away from evidence-based practices that will not reduce congestion and will increase risk to public safety and the Ontario Traffic Council\u2019s urging that efficient flow of traffic should not come at the expense of cyclists\u2019 and other vulnerable road users\u2019 lives\n3) Direct the General Manager of Transportation Services and Director of Planning, Design and Management to continue work on the Council approved 2024-2027 Cycling Network Plan including key projects like Parkside Dr., Dupont Ave., and Danforth-Kingston\n4) Work to rally all 444 municipalities against Bill 212, along with the City of Kingston who have already adopted such motions, in solidarity with the Association of Municipalities of Ontario (AMO)\u2019s statement that requiring provincial approval would be a significant overreach into municipal jurisdiction\n5) Make it clear that the City of Toronto will refuse to comply in spite of the bill's \"requirement for the City of Toronto to provide support to facilitate the removal of the bike lanes\", and not allow a single metre or kilometre of bike lane to be ripped out under provincial decree\n6) Commit to using the city's full moral and legal authority to resist before and beyond should Bill 212 receive Royal Assent\nBill 212 will thwart Toronto\u2019s key cities policies like achieving TransformTO climate action targets and VisionZero Road Safety goals. It is a thin wedge to the province deciding to meddle and undermine local decision-making authority. And in a year that has seen six people killed riding their bikes in Toronto\u2013more than the previous three years combined\u2013the timing of this legislation is a sharp reopening of painful wounds for the friends and families who have lost a loved one on our streets like\u00a0Karen and George Amaro.\nThis is not a moment for compromise. Modern cities build bike lanes, and Toronto is a modern city. Not every trip is bikeable, and not every person will choose to ride a bike, but a network of connected bike lanes helps give people more transportation options. Contrary to the province\u2019s bluster, the City of Toronto already has a robust consultation process planned years in advance, and when bike lanes are planned on arterial roads like Bloor, Yonge, and University it\u2019s because people riding bikes want to get to the same places as people driving and taking transit.\nBike lanes are good for business, they\u2019re great for the environment, and they\u2019re a crucial part of public and personal health. Most of all, bike lanes save lives.\n"

I am writing you to ask you to rethink Bill 212.\nThe proposals designed to accelerate the construction of Highway 413 by forcibly removing homeowners from their property and sidestepping environmental regulations will hurt Ontarians communities and threatens sensitive Greenbelt land that are vital for protecting our air, water, and wildlife. I work in environmental administration and I can tell you that any mistakes made now will be VERY expensive to fix later down the line. Don\u2019t rush this highway. Slow down and take the time to do it right. I think you\u2019re also going to lose a lot of support next election when you start ripping folks out of their homes without any recourse.\nI am also strongly opposed to the new bike lane legislation. Like you and many others I want to get around more quickly and easily. I\u2019m happy to use my bike, walk, transit or drive when it\u2019s easier. Having choices is important, and if you want to reduce traffic you need to give EVERYONE a choice how to get around. Taking away bike lanes is not going to help, it\u2019s a big step backwards. Science has shown time and time again that giving people safe and convenient alternatives to driving REDUCES traffic, and that adding more roads INCREASES congestion and pollution by forcing more people into cars. Plus, anybody that keeps cycling down those main roads are now going to be doing so in the middle of the traffic lane, which is not only dangerous but is also going to slow down traffic more. The whole plan is backwards, it\u2019s completely misguided, disrespectful to people\u2019s freedom of choice and is going to waste a ton of money. If we want to reduce gridlock, we need smart and forward thinking solutions to get more people out of cars. That means public transit and bike lanes.\nIf you want to reduce congestion there are better ways to do it. The science is clear on this. Please reconsider this bill. Ontario needs infrastructure that is forward thinking and competitive on the world stage, not more lanes. Bill 212 will not save us any time or money, it will be a costly misstep.\n"

This appears to be a Big Brother power grab  by the provincial government which wants to tell us what is good for us. It also appears\nto be a very political move trying to bolster support for a probable early provincial election.\nThis act will not decrease  congestion significantly. It doesn\u2019t reflect research or the worldwide experience on the impact of bike lanes. It will limit potential  new cyclists from using bikes as a mode of transportation to work, shop or for recreation.  More cars will be added to the roadway.\nRemoval of lanes would involve an exorbitant cost shouldered by all of the people on Ontario plus the cost incurred by the municipal government working on this issue.  This could be money spent on better public transit for example, which would reduce congestion in cities.\nThe provincial government could have had some discussion with Toronto to make potential adjustments.  A sledge hammer approach to this issue feels arbitrary and undemocratic.\n"

Also, this is fiscally irresponsible political overreach. The government of Ontario must recognize and respect democratically elected local governments whose mandate is to represent their local constituency. The province can stay in their own lane and address larger issues (HEALTHCARE, EDUCATION) at scale.\n"
