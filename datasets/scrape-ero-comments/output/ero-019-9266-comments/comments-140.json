        "comment": "A bunch of issues with this bill.\nIf you're trying to reduce gridlock, removing the need for more cars on the road is key. Actually do analysis on where the majority of the traffic is going to and find strategies to fix that instead of building more highways and removing bike lanes.\nBike lanes and public transit help those traveling within the city while car lanea help those who travel between cities. Both can work together. Also why would you waste our tax dollars like this by ripping out newly built bike lanes.\nThe responsible way to approach this is to only remove those bike lanes when you have replaced them with tested ones that are safe for adults, kids, and seniors to ride on.\n"

But I do drive a car and live downtown Toronto and I can tell you that cyclists and bike lanes are objectively not the problem. Enforcement for drivers \u201cblocking the box\u201d causes more issues than all the bike lanes in Toronto combined.\nThis initiative is an offensive overreach, waste of taxpayer dollars, and another strike on the unfortunate legacy of a more unfortunate Premier.\n"

Removing bike lanes would only increase the risk of such tragedies. Do you really want countless deaths on your hands? We must prioritize the safety of cyclists and create a transportation system that protects human life. Let\u2019s honor the memory of those lost by investing in infrastructure that prevents future fatalities. As the city grows we need to invest more in alternative transit options and not just cars.\n"

        "comment": "This feels like a step backwards.  Progressive countries are accellerating the installation of bike likes and funding public transit.  Why on earth would we want to encourage people to drive more rather than use more sustainable alternatives.\nResearch has shown that adding more lanes for cars does nothing to reduce traffic beyond a short period of time after opening.  When more roads are available, people drive more and quickly saturate the new infrastructure.\nResearch has also shown that bike lanes reduce traffic.\nWhy are we ignoring all evidence and taking a huge step backwards, not to mention accellerating our CO2 production.\nThere are absolutely no logical reasons for these proposals, so I can only assume there are ulterior motives at play here.\n"

The removal of bike lanes in Toronto is an overreaching move by the province, one that is rage-inducing and meant to distract from the fact that this bills purpose is actually to move through the building of highway 43 without adequate environmental assessments and proper process.\nStudies have shown time and time again that cities that value their pedestrians and their safety need dedicated bike lanes. They have shown that they reduce congestion. The bike lanes in Toronto are WIDELY USED and desperately needed.\nI vehemently REJECT this notion that traffic would be alleviated by more car-centric infrastructure.\nI oppose bill 212.\n"

The linked CBC article has even summarized this research.\nPlease consider fixing our health care system instead of worrying about whether bicycles in downtown Toronto are getting where they need to go faster than the premier\u2019s giant SUV.\n"

Part of the reason our government is structured with different levels of responsibility and authority is because some matters pertain to large swaths of people, and some aren't. The management of the streets in my neighbourhood and whether or not I want to be safe riding my bike on them is entirely between me and my city council representative. The people of Ontario should not support a leadership that plays politics at the expense of our lives and well-being.\n"

        "comment": "I was very happy to hear that Ford has plans to remove the bike lanes on Bloor (and Yonge and University).\nI live in the area of Bloor and Islington....and I can tell you from first-hand experience that A) they are not being used anywhere near to capacity, and that B) the intersection is much more dangerous now that people can't clear the intersection.\nThe bike lane on the northeast corner of the intersection acts as a funnel.....taking two eastbound lanes, and one right-hand turn lane....and then trying to squeeze all those cars into a single lane.  Clearly these bike lanes were installed from an ideological perspective, and have nothing to do with people actually being able to move around in a quick and safe manner.\nThe implementation of the bike lanes on Bloor is terrible.....and it should never have been put in place.  Arterial roads are not helped with 50% of the road surface is assigned to a miniscule group of users.  Put the bike lanes on secondary roads....not a major through fare.\n"

Bike lanes are essential for safety of cyclists.\nHaving more bike lanes and cyclists, means that there are fewer cars on the road, and then the cars are able to move more quickly through the city.\nBuilding another highway will not result in faster commuting/driving times. More public transport and diverting truck traffic to the 407 will create faster commuting times.\n"

        "comment": "It's absolutely absurd to consider removing bike lanes when many of these streets have ample on-street parking. While cars parked on the street can contribute to congestion, it's far more logical and efficient to address the issue by reducing on-street parking in favour of dedicated bike lanes. This would not only improve safety for cyclists but also encourage more people to choose cycling as a sustainable mode of transportation, further reducing traffic congestion.\n"

Stick to your lane, bikes are an important way to combat the grid lock and it is extremely naive to think that removing bike lanes will contribute to less grid lock. Imagine if every cyclist had a car? We would be in much worse shape. I urge the government to reconsider their gross overreach and let municipalities handle their own affairs. Ontario government should be focusing on healthcare and education issues that are severely depleted due to underfunding in this province.\n"

There are 17 streets that count Yonge as their only egress from Crescent Road to Heath Street along the midtown bike lanes on Yonge.\nIn some parts of that stretch the road is only 20 metres wide, and yet the City of Toronto has stuffed single north/south car lanes, bike lanes and Caf\u00e9TO along that main artery.\nThe TTC Line 1 complicates matters given surface traffic is clogged with shuttle buses every time the subway is shut down (which is often).\nAdd in hundreds of construction vehicles and workers building multiple new high rise condominiums along that stretch of Yonge, and it\u2019s a disaster.\nWe\u2019ve asked the City for updated comparable emergency response times for police, fire and paramedics on those dead end and one way streets off Yonge versus pre-bike lane installation times, to no avail.\nLet\u2019s put it this way: I sure wouldn\u2019t want to have a heart attack on my dead end street off Yonge during rush hour.\n"

Municipalities have the best understanding of their needs and the needs of their constituents. Moreover the idea that congestion takes priority over other forms of traffic and transit is a well disproven urban planning issue. Made transit and bike lanes are well established to be better and greener long term strategies for handling congestion and protecting the environment. We need more bike lands not fewer. Adding so-called oversight and red tape to creating bike Lanes is a terrible change for Ontario. Invest in public infrastructure Transit and green programs instead\n"
