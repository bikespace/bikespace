        "comment": "As a road user in Toronto (car owner who drives mostly on roads with bike lanes, cyclist and pedestrian at different times) I don\u2019t think removing bike lanes will help move traffic faster and save time.\nRemoving bike lanes will make all road users less safe, including very likely result in deaths and serious injury.\nThis proposal represents a step backwards for the city and the province. There\u2019s been a huge increase in the number of cyclist over the past few years, mostly due to improved cycling infrastructure. The  removal of this infrastructure will shift cyclists back into cars, making driving even slower.\nWe should be building better infrastructure to support and improve conditions for all road users (different forms of micro mobility, conventional bikes etc). The only way to fight congestion is to get more people out of cars-unfortunately this proposal does exactly the opposite.\nUrging the government to reconsider.\n"

        "comment": "The province of Ontario should not remove bike lanes in Toronto, as evidence from Bloor Street shows that bike lanes improve both safety and economic activity. Studies reveal that cyclists and pedestrians, who are the primary users of these lanes, tend to spend more over time than drivers. Additionally, the introduction of bike lanes does not harm businesses but instead enhances foot traffic and local spending. Removing them would ignore these benefits and potentially harm the vibrancy of Toronto\u2019s streets, making them less accessible and safe for all.\n"

It undermines the city jurisdiction and is borderline undemocratic, given in the recent mayoral election candidates with a hostile stance against bike lanes lost miserably.\nFord and his government need to stay away from meddling in city affairs. This bill should never see the light of day. It is shameful and disgraceful.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes should not be the jurisdiction of the province, cities and city planners know best where bike lanes should be placed if they should be placed at all. Bike lanes also allow bicycle traffic to flow without the need for slowdowns while driving to allow cyclists to ride on the road. Ontario drivers are so bad that they often do not know the size of their car and will slow down unnecessarily because they are worried about hitting cyclists in live lanes of traffic. Driving has improved for me on all streets that have bike lanes.\n"

It will allow for more people to bike and less cars on the street, so it's only winning situation.\nDon't use our money for any reason you'd like only to please your corporate friends and offer them a nice and juicy contract. Look at the facts and research properly.\n"

Also, how is it a good use of the city\u2019s time to do a report on traffic for every street? That is just an absolute waste of time when there are better ways for our city employees to spend their time. Shame on you Ford.\nMore roads do not equal less traffic.\nWhat an absolute waste of tax dollars to spend time ripping out infrastructure, which will create MORE traffic and blockages.  I do not support this.\n"

        "comment": "Ontario and Canada are presently dealing with an affordability crisis pilled onto what is only the beginning of a climate crisis. Bike lanes serve to address both of these complex problems by providing a lower cost alternative for personal transportation as compared to public transportation or a person vehicle while simultaneously reducing negative environmental impacts. To restrict or prevent the ability of a city or municipality to introduce bike lanes would be a regressive measure that endangers some of Ontario's most vulnerable road users. I genuinely believe that should this legislation be introduced Ontario will be a joke on the global stage where nations are finding creative solutions and utilizing every lever possible to fight climate change and personal vehicle congestion.\n"

        "comment": "Just because we thankfully didn't vote Ford for mayor in 2014 it's his spite against us we need to bare the rest of our lives.  Why does every city have to have data to refute Ford?  It is Ford that must find the data to refute the business maximizer that is bike lanes.  He cannot. Even the Bloor business association is against removing bike lanes. Everywhere in the world bike lanes increase the economy.  Ford doesn't exist in reality.  He has no data and thus this bill should be immediately cancelled.  Cancel it now before you embarrass yourself and Ontario further.  Also given available data it's possible businesses will sue you too.  Cancel it and next time Ford thinks something is obvious ask him 'do you have any data?'.  The answer will be no and we can all move on.\n"

        "comment": "I have been biking in this city for 15 years and have been amazed at how the city\u2019s infrastructure has grown in bike lanes as well as the number of people who use bikes for transportation. I have heated about dozens of deaths of bikers, and pass by 3 memorials on my daily route to work. 2 of those being people I knew in my personal life. One was my kindergartener teacher, Mr. Samson. Who was a loved teacher, coach and family member. The other, being Alex Amaro, who was 23 when she was hit on Dufferin street. Both of these accidents happened due to the poor biking infrastructure in those areas. (Dufferin having no bike lanes, and Davenport having only painted bike lanes, with no built in protection). It\u2019s painful to see lanes only to be proposed after someone has lost their life in that area ie. Avenue Road, and many parts of Bloor St. With an increase of children and adolescents using these lanes, how can ripping out these lanes, without yet even showing an alternate plan, help vulnerable road users? at the very least, the alternative should be built before ripping out these lanes. I can\u2019t imagine all of these bikers becoming car users on their commute to work, being a solution to car traffic.\n"

        "comment": "This government is incredibly misguided in its priorities in everything, but very much so here. Private automobiles are incredibly harmful to both the environment and society at large, and all governments have a critical moral imperative to actively work to reduce the use of cars.\nThe real issue here of course is that Ontario does not need Highway 413, or more detached single-family housing. We need to aggressively build mid-density housing and better public transit, and we need to end subsidies for driving, and start making motorists pay their fare share.\nFurthermore, if this government was serious at all about reducing gridlock, they would be taking action against the police departments who actively refuse to enforce traffic laws. This of course is at odds with our Premier who had made it clear he believes police are above the law.\n"

        "comment": "Removing safe transportation options like bike lanes is terrible policy for a growing city like Toronto. If I don't have safe bike lanes, I am more likely to use my car, and increase congestion. The rate of population growth cannot support car centric infrastructure. Removing bike lanes will not result in noticeable commute time improvments. Money will be wasted, everyone will still complain about Toronto traffic, and the conservative government will forever tarnish it's \"common sense\" claims, when this policy fails. Moreover, the rural voters the PC party relies on, definitely won't see the benefit to removing downtown Toronto bike lanes, they will however hear about all the wasted taxpayer funds. Oh, and the congestion increases from the construction needed to remove bike lanes on main arteries will go on for years. This is unimaginably bad policy.\n"

The bike lanes the city have been installing keep bikes out of the car traffic lanes, get more people using bikes to get around instead of their cars and do more to reduce traffic than putting the car lane back will ever do.\nDon\u2019t pass this bill. Let the cities manage themselves.\n"

This bill is attempting to undermine the power of the EEA. This is horrific, full stop. It's so blatantly clear that this government is forcing the ridiculous bike lane issue into the spotlight to distract from the real, effectively criminal enterprise at the core of the legislation.\nOwn up to your disgusting, exploitative plans and be clear to the public that you value cash in the pockets of developers over public safety and environmental protection.\n"

        "comment": "This is just absurd. Not only stopping the development of bike lanes continues to limit access to affordable ways of commuting, this will directly endanger any cyclists trying to share the road with cars. On top of that, the Bloor bike lane is constantly under expansion, reaching even further into different parts of the city. The University bike lane was literally just finished, it's the best current option of crossing downtown N/S, and ripping it would clearly be a major waste of money and resources. We know the city doesn't need to continue mishandling and mismanaging their money.\n"

        "comment": "Dear Sir/Madam,  I am writing to express my support the removal of bike lanes from Yonge Street.  I live off of Yonge street in mid-town Toronto and used to bike to work but no longer do so because I do not feel it is safe.  The bike lanes on Yonge street are mainly used by motorized (electric) bikes and scooters, and, by delivery trucks and Uber drivers who park in the bike lane to do their work.  It is not safe for cyclists to be utilizing the same spaces.  The frequent traffic jams on Yonge street - which are the consequence of the bike lanes \u2014 have led to cars speeding through the side street I live on, making it less safe as well.  Our main roads cannot do everything and work well.  They cannot be sidewalk cafes, pedestrian areas, bus routes, parking lots, bike lanes, and main roads for vehicles and function properly.  Bike lanes on side streets like Shaw Street and Russel Hill Road work well.  They do not work well on Yonge Street.\n"
