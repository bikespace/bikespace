        "comment": "I have been living in Toronto for seven years. I am gainfully employed and pay my taxes, vote, and I am strongly against any bill that advocates for the closures and removal of bike lanes in Toronto and surrounding areas. As an avid cyclist I use bike lanes regularly, when available. I bike to work, and I use the bike lanes to get around town on a daily basis. I know that bike lanes save lives. They also help control and direct traffic flow, making it an easier commute for everyone. Bill 212 will create traffic congestion in the short term (while removing bike lanes) and put cyclists lives in increased danger. Forcing cyclists to bike on the shoulder or share lanes with traffic, and having to navigate parked cars that can open doors at any moment increases the likelihood of personal injury and property damage. The environmental impact of having more people turn to driving, and removing safe and viable options for people to make transportation decisions that are better for the planet is a further important reason to keep our bike lanes as is. The Provincial government has no right to change and make decisions about what has, and remains to be, something that is under municipal purview. Please listen to the voice of Torontonians, like myself, who actually depend on bike lanes to keep them safe, and stop the removal and limitation of bike lanes in the city.\n"

        "comment": "I think that where to build bike lanes should be a local decision. It doesn\u2019t make sense for the Ontario government to block decisions made by the local government on where to build bike lanes. Bike lanes in downtown Toronto, including those on Yonge, Bloor, and University, are crucial for helping me feel safe as a cyclist. I am thrilled with the additions to the bike infrastructure that we have seen and I would be very disappointed to see it go. We should be adding more bike lanes, so that cyclists can travel on main streets, not removing them. It's not just about safety, but about being able to get to where I want to go. Most often, the places I want to travel to are on main streets, so having bike lanes where I need to go is an important part of my travel experience. Logically, as more bike lanes get built, even more people will commute using bikes, and this will overall decrease traffic congestion in downtown Toronto. After all, each time you trade a car for a bike, traffic will move faster. Please let the local government make their own decisions.\n"

        "comment": "I am very much opposed to this bill. In fact, it scares me. Is it legal for the province to threaten the lives of vulnerable road users by removing bike lanes? This is just Ford fuelling a culture war to help the Tories in an early election. The impact of this on those of us who cycle is real and dangerous. A 29-year-old teacher at a school where I have worked was killed on Queen Street West, a street that had no bike lanes. I cycle behind young students using the bike lanes along Bloor West daily. They look so vulnerable. Teachers at my school use the bike lanes every day, even in the dead of winter, to get to school. We have had bike racks installed and have events celebrating commuting to school by bike. What will happen to all of us? The bike lanes provide a critical buffer zone. Safe streets save lives. Please don't pass this bill!\nPS I have attached an article about Peter Cram, the teacher who was killed while riding his bike.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes will not make people who use bikes as transportation disappear. It will certainly not make traffic less congested, since bikes will be forced into traffic lanes. Removing existing lanes will put cyclists in danger and make traffic worse for drivers. No one wins under this proposal. There is no evidence to support the idea that removing bike lanes will give cars more space on the roads. Bikes will continue to exist, and people will continue to use them\u2026.\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nI\u2019m deeply concerned about the proposed legislation targeting the removal of specific bike lanes in Toronto. With pressing provincial issues like the shortage of family physicians, long wait times for healthcare, housing unaffordability, and challenges in education, I\u2019m puzzled as to why the legislature is intervening in Toronto\u2019s municipal affairs\u2014a role that should rest with City Council.\nThe proposed changes claim to reduce gridlock for drivers, but are there independent studies to support this? Why are expert opinions from groups like the Association of Municipalities of Ontario, Ontario Traffic Council, and over 120 medical professionals being ignored?\nWhere is the long-term vision for safe, livable cities? Many European cities, admired for their biking infrastructure, offer a model we could emulate.\nAs someone who commutes by bike on the Danforth/Bloor lanes, I feel much safer and ride more often thanks to this infrastructure. Without these lanes, cycling next to cars becomes dangerous, and I, like many others, would likely stop. The loss of cyclists\u2019 lives is a tragic consequence of prioritizing traffic flow over safety.\nI urge the government to reject this bill and focus on creating sustainable, healthy cities that support cyclists, walkers, and transit users.\nThank you.\n"

Bike lanes on major streets like Bloor, Yonge, and University have made cycling safer, reduced traffic congestion, and encouraged more sustainable forms of transportation. Removing them not only jeopardizes the safety of cyclists but also takes us backward in our efforts to address climate change and build a more livable city. Decisions about bike lanes should remain in the hands of local governments who understand the unique needs of their communities\u2014not dictated by the province. This bill undermines progress and ignores the benefits these bike lanes bring to all road users, including drivers.\n"

        "comment": "This legislation is beyond ridiculous. It is absolutely egregious and a complete overreach of Provincial responsibility. The province is not in a position to know what is best for each municipality and local communities. This is such an obvious attempt to control what Toronto does because Ford has some kind of a vendetta against the city. I have never seen a Premier so obsessed with controlling what municipalities do. Perhaps he should take that energy and obsession and direct it to what the province is responsible for. Like our broken healthcare system and improving our education system. All this is going to do is create more bureaucracy, waste time and spend money on administration that is completely unnecessary. Stop applying blanket legislation to the entire province when your gripe is with Toronto. Eighty percent of the population does NOT live in Toronto. Sixty percent does NOT live in the GTA. This legislation isn\u2019t even relevant in many places outside of Toronto. You want to get Ontarians moving? Invest in more trains and public transit in Southern Ontario so we can avoid the 401. Also, there is plenty of research demonstrating that active transportation reduces gridlock. This Bill is the complete opposite of solving the problem.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is detrimental to the safety of cyclists and I can tell you that with lived experience. I cycle throughout the fall, spring, summer, and some of the winter and I can tell you that every time I ride on a road without bike lanes I encounter immense risk. The other day I went down a few blocks of Dundas W to pick up some boots (I had no other route with a bike lane) and was almost hit twice by vehicles. There is seemingly only anecdotal evidence provided by the provincial government to indicate the removal of bike lanes will improve traffic. I don\u2019t find that convincing. I also don\u2019t find convincing the opinion that cycling is for pleasure and that cyclists can take winding routes through residential streets to get to where they need to be. There is a reason why Bloor is frequented. Just as drivers desire efficiency, so do cyclists.\nAs a city, our aim is to reduce our emissions, I hardly understand how eliminating one of the most popular alternatives \u2014 often faster than public transit \u2014 will serve to push us towards this goal. Seemingly every city I visit is pushing forward with their bike lanes, yet our province wants to see our city regress.\nWhat this bill will achieve is not faster routes for drivers, if anything, additional lanes will lead to more speeding, which will then lead to inevitable pedestrian and cyclist deaths. Why would we want faster cars within the downtown? If a commute must be slowed by a few minutes to save lives, so be it?\nAs a province we must ask ourselves what we value more. The lives of our constituents or an unproven decrease in the daily time spent commuting for drivers. And I additionally add that it is conjecture\u2014heretofore\u2014that bike lanes slow traffic to the intolerable extent the province anecdotally suggests.\nIt has been known for some time now that introducing further lanes will only lead to an increased ridership which in turn will erase any efficiencies sought to be gained. This is known as induced demand and has been covered by a number of academics \u2014 evidently not by our province. Do we want more cars on the road?\nWhat also stands to reason is that every cyclist route eliminated will then lead to citizens\u2014who would have cycled prior\u2014ordering an uber or driving to their destination instead. I hardly see how this will ease congestion for drivers.\nWhat has been proven to increase traffic is the construction we see seemingly everywhere in our city. To reduce congestion, increased coordination around the development of these sites should be focused upon, not cyclist lanes \u2014 where no research seems to exist. Additionally, to remove these lanes, how long will traffic be impacted? And at what cost? And at what risk given\u2014as I\u2019ve mentioned numerous times\u2014the lack of concrete evidence?\nThank you for your time.\n"

        "comment": "Dear Elected Representatives,\nI am a resident of Toronto, a small business owner, and a daily commuter who rides a bike in order to take the subway across town to her workplace. I also happen to be a car owner who is happy to leave her car parked.\nI am writing to express my opposition to the bill that would authorize the province to override our city planners, and the many residents who rely on the network of dedicated bike lanes to get around safely. Bike lanes are an important part of our transportation infrastructure. They are also a matter of life and death for cyclists. They give people (like myself) options other than getting into cars for trips around town. Cycling is often the fastest way to get from A to B in our neighbourhoods. It's great exercise and lots of fun, when you have a safer place to ride. Cyclists are also taxpayers and full members of the community who deserve to be taken seriously.\nIt should also be noted that there are a lot of people in this city who can't afford cars, or who rely on bikes for work. Deliverypeople working for very low wages should at least have safer working conditions. It seems that this bill is aimed towards a middle-class, suburban group of voters who do not care about the real people living in Toronto.\nFurthermore, the arguments that bike lanes can easily just be moved to parallel side streets just shows that Doug Ford and his allies don't live in Toronto, which is built upon a series of ravines. The stretch of Bloor Street along High Park where I live, for example, was made level and straight during its original construction, while nearby streets are extremely hilly and meandering. If there was a sensible side-street option for cycling, we'd be all for it, but there simply isn't, and anyone who rides a bike here can tell you that. Try crossing the Don River Valley on anything but a major road.\nThank you for considering these comments, and please vote against this bill.\nSincerely, a Toronto resident.\n"

        "comment": "Dear Government of Ontario,\nI read the information in the above link (https://ero.ontario.ca/notice/019-9266). I am astounded by the shortsighted and biased approach to transportation that this proposed legislation entails. It seems that for every so-called problem that the Act tries to address, it is doing the exact opposite of what needs to happen. For example, municipalities are the experts on what is needed locally, and many have invested a lot of time, money and resources into making cycling (and other light vehicular transportation - scooters, etc.) safer, more accessible and more enjoyable for tens of thousands of people. The province, by giving itself a retroactive veto to many completed infrastructure projects, would be operating with a very heavy-handed, top-down and ill-informed approach. It reeks of politics, not sense. I am a cyclist and, though I don't actually agree with all of the infrastructure put in, I very much appreciate that efforts are being made to reduce rather than accommodate and increase the capacity for motor vehicles. And let us be clear, the four points outlined in the Act:\n(The Government of Ontario:\n-Recognizes the need to build priority highways faster as our province grows in order to get people and goods out of gridlock and save drivers and businesses time and money.\n-Recognizes that accidents and lane closures can worsen traffic congestion and impact the quality of life of Ontarians.\n-Is speeding up the delivery of broadband projects that will connect people in all parts of Ontario, including rural areas, with reliable internet access.\n-Is building Highway 413, recognizing the importance of this highway to millions of drivers from across Ontario.)\nindicate very clearly the governments goals and philosophy, that is, to expand capacity for motor vehicles at a great rate. To this end, I ask - what are the actual problems facing Ontarians (most of the world, really) when it comes to transportation and motor vehicles? Here are a few:\n- Motor vehicles create traffic, gridlock, long commutes, lost time, stress and other problems.\n- Motor vehicles are responsible for the dangers of transportation.\n- Bicycles and pedestrians do not cause the traffic on Ontario's streets, though they do experience it with all its dangers and delays.\n- Motor vehicles cause massive amounts of pollution which a) reduces air quality for all Ontarians, including those who do not drive, and b) has devastating effects on the province's ecology. The gravity of these problems cannot be overstated.\n- New and expanded highways cause massive damage to the province's ecology through destruction of habitats.\nGranted, what to do about Ontario's expanding population and it's desire to be mobile is no simple puzzle and there is no solution that will please everybody. However, what is at the heart of this Act can be summarized as 'More'. More roads, more motor vehicles, more pollution, more habitat destruction, more expectations from citizens that they can drive without consequence and more encouragement from their government to do so, more normalization of the idea that we need 'More'. I challenge the government instead to think about the uncomfortable you ultimately inevitable question of how to do 'Less'. How do we get people out of motor vehicles? How do we encourage working near home to reduce commuting? How do look at our environment and see something that desperately needs to survive rather than something that is expendable at a human whim? Indeed, how do we tackle the environmental (habitat destruction, pollution) and societal (gridlock, lost time, stress, lost money) problems we face when governments contribute to the already-present culture of 'More'? through legislation? 'More' cannot go on indefinitely, no matter what our short-sighted and self-centred human brains tend to trick us into believing. So I challenge the government not to give in to this way of thinking that causes such long-lasting harm, despite the comforts we currently enjoy so greatly. Instead, think about whether we really need more. Think hard about the word 'need' and what it really means. Think about what people living one hundred years from now will think about our decisions to expand despite knowing how harmful it is.\n"

        "comment": "I walk, cycle, take transit, and drive in Toronto. I find this proposal deeply disappointing and frankly alarming. More than anything, it demonstrates that this government is willing to completely ignore its constituents, municipal government, research evidence, and common sense in favour of reactionary decision-making. I would be interested to know if it is part of a strategy to draw attention away from many other ill-thought-out and potentially dangerous actions, including changes to home care (Bill 135) and cuts to education.\nThe idea that removing existing bike lanes will reduce gridlock is absolutely laughable. It is unbelievable that anyone in government thinks this is logical. I must question the Premier's motives when such clear evidence exists that this proposal will not accomplish what he says it will. The way to reduce gridlock is to reduce the number of cars on the roads. It is truly that simple. You can do that by improving transit infrastructure and, yes, maintaining and expanding the city's network of bike lanes.\nAs a driver, I am grateful every time I am on a road with a protected bike lane, because they reduce my risk of accidentally killing someone. It is unconscionable that this government appears to accept more lost lives in order to show voters that it is addressing gridlock. Which, again, the proposed actions will not accomplish.\nI cycle because it is usually the most efficient way to get where I need to go. It is also good for my health and for the environment. In this time of climate crisis, the Ontario government should be directing policy and funding towards initiatives that improve the health of Ontarians and of the planet. Instead it is proposing the opposite.\nFor a government that purports to care about saving Ontarians money, the costs associated with removing existing bike lanes is absurd. I am horrified that in a time when multiple sectors are in crisis (including developmental services, where I work), the idea that Premier Ford and this government would essentially pour millions down the drain to undo prior work in a move that not only will not reduce gridlock but will likely increase it while the roads are under construction.\nIt's not clear to me why Premier Ford has such contempt for Torontonians like myself who seem to have different values from his. But I also feel quite sure he is smart enough to know this proposal is terrible from every angle. I urge Premier Ford to reconsider this proposal in light of the physical, environmental, and financial harm it would cause.\n"

        "comment": "I am a resident and taxpayer of Toronto and Ontario I find it wasteful of taxpayers hard earned money to destroy bicycling infrastructure that has been installed over many years after much consultation with the general population.  Bike lanes have not been installed on major highways which are the primary area of congestion concerns .  They have been mainly installed on roads in mainly high density areas of the urban core.  Bike lanes are busiest at the busiest times of the rush hours which is when they are in fact reducing the number of single occupancy cars on the roads therefore reducing congestion.  In hours outside rush hours there is less use by autos and bikes and already less congestion .  It is construction, incomplete transit infrastructure like the Eglinton LRT and the number of single occupant drivers which are the real source of the congestion.  This issue is really about catering to singe occupant car drivers who often are driving in neighborhoods they do not live in and choose to drive singly from the suburbs instead of taking public transit during the busiest times of the day.   Removing bike lanes will lead to more residents and citizens and taxpayers that ride bikes being run over and killed .  It will lead to more people choosing to drive and increase the release of carbon and contributing to climate change. Major and minor cities around the world are increasing bike lanes to mitigate climate change, reduce pollution , improve the health of citizens,  reduce biker deaths and make cities more pleasant places .  These include New Yorik,  Paris , London ,  Chicago, San Fransisco,  Los Angelos, Bogota, Copenhagen and numerous others.   Bikers are residents and deserve respect from elected officials like car owners .  There has to be a balance.  Removing bike lanes is a move backwards for the city and it\u2019s residents.  Some find change difficult to deal with but in this case it is better for the health the city.\n"

        "comment": "I'm writing as a mother and as an urban planner to implore the provincial government to take a longer, evidence-based perspective on the matters addressed by Bill 212.\nDecades of urban planning experiments globally have proven that you get what you build. If we continue to house people in urban outskirts with no choice but to drive, and excelerate highways to connect them, then when they reach dense urban destinations there simply isn't enough room. Investment in transit is key, but the timeframes are so long. With Toronto being the fastest growing city in North America (with more cranes in the sky than the next 13 cities combined!) we cannot afford to wait 15 years for the next provincial transit project to be operational.\nBike lanes are literally buying you time to address congestion right now by giving people transportation options while we continue to build out a transit system that will be the enduring lifeline of such a rapidly growing city.\nRemoving cycling infrastructure will put thousands of lives at risk on a daily basis for people that have come to rely on cycling as a safe and efficient means of transportation. And for what, to get another few hundred cars stuck in traffic? In the voice of George and Karen Amaro who's 23 year old daughter Alex was killed while cycling on Dufferin Street, \"We don\u2019t want just motorists to get home to their families faster, we want everybody to get home to their families.\"\nPlease, work with your local municipalities to take meaningful action on congestion and introduce changes that have proven to be impactful. Removing bike lanes will only increase car dependency and put lives at risk.\nI've attached below the letters from The Ontario Society of Professional Planners, The Association of Ontario Municipalities, The Ontario Traffic Council and the Ontario Society of Professional Engineers as well as the letter from 120 physicians and researchers and Toronto City Council all condemning this Bill.  I listened to the countless testimonials at Queen's Park yesterday including planners, families who have lost loved ones who never wanted to politicize their loss, and MPPs stating that they have never witnessed a greater opposition to a single piece of legislation. I've also attached the study contracted by Environmental Defence that shows how subsidizing freight vehicles to incentivize use of the under-utilized Hwy 407 would provide a much more immediate and fiscally prudent option to improve congestion on the 401, one of the world's busiest highways.\nIf our government is going to claim to tackle such an impactful problem, PLEASE listen to the professionals and work on real evidence based solutions that will have real impact, instead of imposing a cheap scapegoat that will put lives at risk and inhibit the ability of cities to actually address their congestion problems.\nWith expectation that this message will be heard alongside all of the advise of the professionals who have been working hard for decades to bring provincial policy statements into action through municipal scale solutions.\n"
