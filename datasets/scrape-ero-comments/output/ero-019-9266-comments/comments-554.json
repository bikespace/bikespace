        "comment": "I live in the Lawrence and Eglington riding in Toronto and commute to work in the downtown core by bike - I also drive a F-150 which makes me a pretty unique commuter cyclist.\nPreviously, I use to drive downtown to work but with commute times over an hour I thought biking would be a healthier, safe and quicker option. While I live near the subway, I want to get fresh air and biking seemed like the best option.\nFor the last four years, I\u2019ve been biking to and from work, including last year through the winter.\nBike lanes have saved my life more times than I want to admit. As a truck driver, I know I can\u2019t see everything in front of me all the time and I need to go slowly and be careful. Drivers downtown lose that perspective and will do just about anything to move a few paces ahead or make a light while it\u2019s still green.\nAs a bike commuter I appreciate having protected bike lanes as it doesn\u2019t make me think twice about if I can take a certain street home. Having protected bike lanes on major roads allows me to safely and quickly get home to see my kids. If I need to take side streets, it takes more time and more time on the road equals more potential time for a car to hit you. As a truck driver I also appreciate seeing the protected bike lanes as they serves as a guide for cyclists and drivers. As a driver, without the bike lanes, I won\u2019t know where to look for a cyclist - maybe they are trying to squeeze by on the left or sitting behind me or on my right.\nUltimately, cyclists will ride wherever they want, the province should be making it safer and easier for them to do so and not place them danger simply for trying to get to and from work.\n"

        "comment": "This is a huge detriment to cyclists! Folks who bike are helping the congestion. We know the stats-  the solution to congestion is not increasing lane ways or highways it\u2019s investing in non-vehicle transportation like public transport and bicycles. Removing the few safe and highly used bike lanes in the city is the antithesis of supporting congestion in this city.\n"

        "comment": "This is a very bad idea in my opinion.\nThe provincial government should stay out of municipal affairs and let the municipalities make these kinds of decisions. They are best positioned to decide what works best.\nThe biggest traffic gridlock causing problems are not bike lanes but rather condo construction taking over lanes of the roadway, sometimes for years at a time. This is happening all over the City of Toronto and needs to be more carefully managed.\nTraffic congestion is actually alleviated by having more cyclists and fewer cars on the road. More people would ride bikes if there are bike lanes which make it safer for all road users.\nIt would also help if the Provincial government put more money into public transit making it a viable option for more drivers, thus taking more cars off the roads. Completion of the Eglinton Crosstown would also help.\n"

        "comment": "I am strongly opposed to multiple facets of this bill because they are based on partisan politics and not on evidence-based reasoning. The bill as written would go against against the best interests of Ontario residents/voters in terms of quality of life, traffic flow, safety, and fiscal responsibility.\nThis bill's promotion of the building of highway 413 ignores years of environmental studies at taxpayer expense that both indicated that its route will irreparably damage vulnerable habitat for our native species as well as encourage more people to use cars for transportation. The money would be better spent on improving public transit in the wider GTA, including GO train service.\nThe section of the bill advocating for the removal of bike lanes in Toronto also overrides the judgment of the municipalities about what is best for them and their voters. Toronto bike lanes came about after hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars were spent studying the impacts of bike lanes on urban traffic flow and safety, and they were built because these studies indicated that bike lanes improve traffic flow, public safety, and money spent at local businesses along bike lane routes. It would be extremely counterproductive to override the positive impact that bike lanes are having by spending *even more* taxpayer dollars to rip them out. A responsible Ontario government would encourage cycling as a healthy and green means of transportation. It would work to reduce gridlock and support local businesses, as many municipalities around the world have already done, by encouraging the use of public transit and pedestrian/cycle traffic in intensified density urban cores, the economic drivers of our province.\nAs an Ontario voter and taxpayer who cycles and works to protect our green spaces and farmland, I urge you to stop pushing for highway 413 and the removal of bike lanes in Toronto and to focus instead on bolstering public transit and the integrity of our greenbelt. The long-term quality of life of Ontarians depends on it.\nSincerely,\nA concerned Ontarian\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes in Toronto is a short-sighted decision that will have serious negative consequences. It will increase traffic congestion as bikes would be forced into car lanes, worsen air quality, and discourage people from choosing sustainable modes of transportation. It would make it more dangerous to bike within the city further alienating potential riders from choosing a healthier option compared to driving. It's also worth noting that provincial intervention in such a local matter is unnecessary and potentially harmful to the city's autonomy and ability to tailor solutions to its specific needs. The province should focus on broader transportation infrastructure projects rather than micromanaging local street designs.\n"

        "comment": "ERO Number: 019-9266.\nI am deeply disappointed by the Ministry of Transportation\u2019s proposed legislation that would force Toronto to remove bike lanes on three important streets. This legislation is clearly not based on evidence, fact, or basic logic. Not only that, but you are proposing to introduce new red tape when it comes to planning decisions. How does adding a whole new layer of approval from the Ministry of Transportation support your government\u2019s priority to reduce municipal red tape in our planning process? Roads are public property that are meant to accommodate traffic and provide safety for all users. That has to include drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians. I have lived in the City of Toronto for over 15 years, and I can assure you that there will continue to be cyclists on the roads you have named, regardless of you removing the bike lane infrastructure that exists. Your ministry will not be reducing the number of people who cycle on those roads, you will only be endangering their lives on a daily basis.\nCars cause congestion. Too many people drive in this City of 3 million people. You need to encourage people out of their cars and instead onto GO Transit, TTC, carpooling, cycling, and walking. Someone who lives two cities away, say in Brampton, cannot reasonably expect to be able to drive themselves alone in their car to the downtown core of a city of 3 million people without encountering traffic. Your government can work on making GO train service more reliable for that commuter, but you can never promise that person an easy drive to downtown Toronto. There was terrible traffic on Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue before you were ever in power and before bike lanes were installed. Since that time, the City and surrounding region have grown by millions of people, the traffic is not going away.\nI cycled regularly on Bloor before the bike lanes, and I will continue to do so, regardless of you making roads less safe for me as a cyclist. When I am on a road that doesn\u2019t have bike lanes, I ensure that I cycle in the middle of the driving lane, so that vehicles are forced to stay behind me and give me enough clearance.\nI know that as a politician, you mostly care about votes rather than people\u2019s lives. I can assure you that you will be losing votes in suburban ridings over this legislation. My family lives in the suburbs in ridings your government currently holds. They are angry that you are putting their family members at risk with your game of politics. The people of this province are interconnected and legislation that endangers the lives of cyclists in Toronto will have repercussions for your party in Peel, York and Waterloo region.\nPlease reconsider your legislation, otherwise it is unlikely your political and personal legacy will be anything greater than that of someone who decided to endanger the lives of innocents because he didn\u2019t like waiting in traffic.\n"

        "comment": "I am a long-time resident of Toronto and a regular cyclist. I have been glad that over the past several years, my transportation options in this city have included bike lanes allowing me to cycle quickly and safely over much of the city. I strongly oppose Bill 212 plans to limit and even remove bike lanes.\nCyclists want to be able to cycle safely on streets like Bloor or Yonge for the same reason as car drivers. These streets provide direct east-west or north-south links across the city. The Ministry of Transportation has casually stated that cyclists can easily use \u201cside streets\u201d, but if you look at a map of Toronto, streets that provide direct links are few. Cyclists would have to go far out of the way, zig-zagging from one street to another, adding to their commute time.\nBike lanes also save lives by allowing bikes and cars to safely share the road.\nThe City's data shows  Toronto's emergency vehicle response times have not been adversely affected by bike lanes\nThere is no one easy solution to congestion in Toronto. It will require progress in many different areas:cars (such as better enforcement of traffic violations like \u201cBlocking the Box\u201d which slows traffic), public transit (such as properly funding the TTC and getting the Eglinton LRT operating), pedestrian space, and safe lanes for bicycles.\nI urge the Ontario Government to look at a full response to transit improvement, rather than scapegoating bike lanes, and drop Bill 212.\n"

Listen to all these qualified people surrounding you. People who have spent their life learning, analyzing and assessing options. Do not waste any more public money. Focus on removing senior management from Metrolinx and finding the right people who will DELIVER rapid transit on time and budget. Transit is what the province should be focusing on. Make it a priority. The rest of world will be laughing at us if you move forward with accelerating highway constructions and removing multi million dollar investments in cities cycling infrastructure.\n"

By choosing to cycle, I\u2019m helping reduce congestion and pollution, making the city more livable for everyone. Removing bike lanes would force cyclists like myself onto busy streets, increasing the risk of accidents and potentially pushing us back into cars, which would only add to traffic and emissions.\nBike lanes on streets like Bloor-Danforth have proven vital for safe commuting. Instead of taking them away, the Ontario government should be investing in more cycling infrastructure to support a healthier, greener, and less congested city.\nThe solution to reducing traffic downtown will not be for people like me to go buy yet another car to create more and be stuck in traffic!\n"

        "comment": "Thank you for your time. I do not agree with this proposed Act because I believe it is the wrong approach for reducing congestion and improving safety in the city. As Toronto grows, what we need is a stronger public transit system and more protections for cyclists, not more space for cars, and not more highways that devastate our green spaces. The sensible solution to congestion is more affordable, more available, and more widespread public transit. Taking away bike lanes will not reduce the amount of bike traffic downtown; it will simply make it more dangerous to bike. No bike lanes means more cyclist injuries and fatalities: some of the exact accidents that cause lane closures. Frankly, it is rather insulting that this Act prioritizes car owners at the expense of cyclists, walkers, and wheelchair users. It is also insulting, and inefficient, that municipalities would be required to seek provincial approval for new bike lanes. Municipalities should not have to seek approval for such projects that are well within municipal jurisdiction, contribute to public safety, and provide environmentally-friendly alternatives to car usage. On that note, the exemption of authorities involved in bike lane removal from the Environmental Assessment Act runs counter to what should be a main priorities for our provincial government: protecting our fragile urban green spaces and waterways.\n"

        "comment": "This bill will heavily harm cyclists in Ontario by removing bike lanes. Almost every bike lane is created by removing a lane of traffic so I'm not sure how Ontario is supposed to keep any bike lane after this.\nRemoving bike lanes on Bloor St., Yonge St., and University Ave. will be detrimental to cyclist safety. Bloor St bike lanes are one of the few bike lanes that stretch far enough between east and west compared to College Street for example that abruptly stops.\nUniversity Ave as well is the safest road to cycle north and south right now in downtown Toronto. If the bike lanes are removed then cyclists will have to contest with traffic on Bathurst and Spadina.\nNote that without bike lanes, cyclists are still going to bike in Ontario but now in more dangerous conditions. Doug Fords proposed bill will increase cyclist deaths and blood will be on his hands for driving cyclists into the path of cars.  This bill cannot and should not exist.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly object to Ontario Bill 212 (Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024).\nI live and work downtown Toronto (for 20+ years).  Prior to this, I lived in a suburb of Toronto but worked or travelled downtown Toronto.\nBill 212 represents a concerning erosion of environmental protections and democratic oversight in Ontario. By exempting Highway 413 from the Environmental Assessment Act and creating a weaker self-monitored review process, it prioritizes rapid development over environmental preservation, particularly threatening sensitive Greenbelt ecosystems. The bill dangerously concentrates power with the Minister while reducing local municipal authority, public consultation, and community input on major infrastructure decisions.  The legislation's approach to Indigenous consultation lacks meaningful mechanisms for addressing concerns and appears to prioritize development over treaty rights.\nBill 212's requirement for Ministry approval of bicycle lanes in prescribed municipalities represents a dangerous overreach into local transportation planning. By adding bureaucratic barriers to implementing bike lanes, especially when they would replace vehicle lanes, the bill undermines municipal autonomy and actively works against sustainable urban transportation goals. This centralized control over bike infrastructure will likely delay or prevent the creation of safe cycling networks, forcing continued car dependency and working against climate action, public health, and community-led complete streets initiatives. The bill prioritizes car traffic flow over sustainable transportation options that many communities want and need, effectively letting the province veto local active transportation plans that have been developed through extensive community consultation and study.\nIts car-centric focus undermines sustainable transportation goals and climate commitments. The expanded expropriation powers with reduced property owner protections could lead to community displacement and inequitable development patterns.\nThis bill essentially fast-tracks controversial highway projects by removing crucial environmental and democratic safeguards, benefiting developers while potentially harming communities and ecosystems. The rushed approach could compromise both environmental and worker safety standards, while making it significantly harder for citizens to challenge decisions or seek legal remedies.\nInstead of fast-tracking controversial highways, the Ontario government should address urgent crises affecting residents daily: the severe shortage of affordable housing, overwhelmed emergency rooms and healthcare staffing shortages, rising homelessness, and inadequate mental health services. We need immediate action on childcare affordability, education system funding, and poverty reduction through improved social assistance rates. Climate change demands investment in public transit and protecting green spaces, not more highways. These critical issues impact millions of Ontarians and deserve the government's full attention and resources.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are positive for urban centres. They create safe places for active, environmentally friendly transportation, which is desperately needed in a warming climate. Congestion is not cause by cyclists, it is caused by poor urban planning and an outdated culture that pushes and builds for personal vehicle use above public transportation. A better bill would be one that helps municipalities construct more opportunities for active transport, which would create jobs and reduce pollution in urban centres.\nRemoving bike lanes already constructed is a waste of time, money and resources. Removing the need for an environmental assessment is cynical and sets a precedent to continue to ignore our shared responsibility to reduce emissions.\nPrioritizing cars in a major city centre is not forward-thinking policy. Cities need to find efficient ways to move people around and a single person in a vehicle is about as inefficient as it comes. This bill appears to be an embarrassing overreach from the Ford government on a municipal issue in order to pander to a certain type of constituent.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing in protest against Bill 212.\nPassing Bill 212 with the framework to remove bikes lanes is anti-environmental, and lethal. Adding red tape by imposing applications to build protected bike lanes on roads slows down progress to environmentally sustainable future.\nThere are many ways to get around in a city: walking, biking, subway, bus, and driving by car. Bikes are often as fast as busses and use no gas. The least efficient way, and the least environmentally friendly way, is by car.\nProtected bike lanes serve as a safe path for bikers to travel on. Without them, bicycles have to share the road with cars. Which is very dangerous. Cars and bikes do not mix. Bikes cannot travel on the narrow downtown sidewalks either; crowded sidewalks and bikes do not mix.\nAs such this will discourage people from biking to work, to shop, and to venues. It is bad for business. Instead they may choose to drive just so they can be safe again. This is worse for the environment, and will add to the car congestion instead of reducing it.\nFor the brave bicyclists who will stubbornly continue to commute by bike, an environmentally better way to travel, will have to contend with cars on the road. This year alone in Toronto, 6 bicyclists died in car collisions. Without a protected bike lane, do you expect the number to go down, or up? People will die.\n"
