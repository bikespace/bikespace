Bike lanes make good sense for people who actually live downtown and someone who lives in the suburbs should not be forcing decisions on us that affect our lives and safety. We\u2019ll remember what you did here in the next election.\n"

This contradicts the promises they were elected on.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly appose the removal of bike lanes in Ontario, especially those in Toronto. Dedicated bike lanes are invaluable to city residents. Improving cycling infrastructure reduces traffic congestion, is better for the environment, and makes the city less noisy, less dangerous, and promotes a sense of community. Removing bike lanes without municipal approval is absolutely heinous and unacceptable.\n"

        "comment": "This is an utterly stupid policy change. Municipalities know where the pain-points are in their infrastructure and their city planners work to ensure street designs meet the needs of the people living in and travelling through their municipality. The municipalities do not add bike lanes for fun or to spite drivers, they add them because studies show that bike lanes reduce traffic and are safer for cyclists. The provincial government does not possess the granular view of each municipality to go mucking about in city street design. Stop being so incredibly daft, stop wasting money, leave municipal street design (and bike lanes) to the municipalities. Maybe spend some of the money that's burning a hole in the provincial coffers on healthcare, where it's desperately needed...\n"

        "comment": "This bill is an abomination; going against everything that makes Toronto and city living what it is, convenient. I bike to work year round; it is the fastest way around the city. The bike infrastructure was one of the only pieces of Toronto that was gaining momentum and seeing a change for the better. Taking away bike lanes will get people hurt or even killed. Cars are dangerous, large, slow, and unfathomably catered towards despite many Torontonians not even owning one. I, like many others will still be on our bikes, \u201ctaking up space\u201d and putting our lives at risk to get around town. You are all cowards.\n"

        "comment": "As we continue to grow and look toward the future of transportation in our province, it\u2019s becoming increasingly clear that building cities around cars is unsustainable. We need to shift our focus toward alternative modes of transport that not only reduce congestion but also create healthier, more livable environments. One of the most effective solutions to this is promoting bicycles as a primary mode of transportation, alongside improving the infrastructure for other alternative transport options.\nWe can learn a great deal from cities like Amsterdam and Copenhagen, both of which have long embraced bicycles as a central mode of transport. In Amsterdam, for example, nearly 40% of all trips are made by bicycle. This shift has not only eased traffic congestion but also drastically improved air quality and contributed to better public health outcomes. Copenhagen, similarly, has invested heavily in bike lanes, even building \u201ccycling superhighways\u201d that allow residents to travel long distances safely by bike. As a result, cycling accounts for nearly 50% of trips to work or school in the city.\nThese cities\u2019 success stories offer compelling proof that when we design urban spaces for bikes and public transit, we create more efficient, healthier, and more connected communities. Conversely, cities built around cars suffer from high levels of congestion, air pollution, and the need for more space for parking, highways, and roads, often at the expense of parks, public spaces, and walking paths.\nInvesting in better infrastructure for alternative modes of transportation\u2014such as expanded bike lanes, pedestrian-friendly streets, and efficient public transit\u2014makes sense not just for cyclists, but for everyone. A well-planned network of bike lanes and paths reduces the number of cars on the road, leading to less congestion and a safer, more pleasant environment for all road users. It also reduces our reliance on fossil fuels, contributing to our broader environmental and sustainability goals.\nMoreover, better infrastructure for biking and public transit means more accessible cities for people of all ages and backgrounds. In places where alternatives to cars are prioritized, we see more equitable cities where people can move around easily, regardless of whether they own a car or not.\nOur province has the potential to be at the forefront of this shift toward more sustainable, people-focused transportation. By investing in cycling infrastructure and improving our public transit systems, we can create communities that are safer, greener, and more resilient. It\u2019s time to rethink how we build our cities\u2014not around cars, but around the people who live in them.\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n"

        "comment": "This is a terrible idea. Bike lanes should not be removed in the name of speeding up traffic. The effect on traffic that bike lanes have is negligible and their existence makes streets a safer place for everyone. I've also heard the argument that bike lanes can slow down emergency vehicles, but the opposite is true. Emergency vehicles get stuck in car traffic, but bikes can move out of bike lanes easily giving emergency vehicles an empty lane to get to where they need to go.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to Bill 212. While I understand the importance of addressing gridlock, this bill fails to recognize the serious safety risks it poses to users of non-motorized transportation like cyclists, scooter riders, rollerbladers (my primary mode of transportation), and pedestrians.\nBy requiring provincial approval for new bike lanes that could reduce traffic lanes, the bill discourages the development of protected spaces that are essential for the safety of cyclists and other non-motorized vehicle users. Without dedicated infrastructure, we are forced onto roads alongside speeding vehicles, increasing the risk of collisions, serious injuries, and fatalities.\nIn a year when pedestrian deaths have tragically risen, largely due to speeding drivers, this bill\u2019s provisions\u2014such as encouraging faster traffic flow and raising speed limits\u2014only make our streets more dangerous. Non-motorized transportation plays a critical role in reducing congestion and pollution, and should be encouraged through safer infrastructure, not jeopardized by legislative barriers.\nI urge you to reconsider Bill 212, as it compromises the safety of those who rely on active, sustainable transportation methods. Protecting lives should take precedence over marginal reductions in traffic time.\n"

From what I can see Bloor, Yonge and University bike lanes are all well designed and well functioning. The traffic also seems calmer while flowing reasonably, and there is designated parking.  Perhaps some of the suburban bike lanes are not so well designed and used, but bizarrely these do not seem to be the focus of the bill, if the premier\u2019s comments are a guide. I will not support a government and party in the future if it continues this type of buffoonery.\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nI strongly disagree and am not in support of this bill.\nIt has been extensively studied and is very well known that the only way to solve traffic is to allow alternative modes of transportation other than taking a car. Cycling falls under this category and is a net benefit to the city.\nCars take up too much space on the roads and adding more lanes or building more highways will just lead to more congestion. Cycling is a great mode of transportation for those who want to travel short distance. Instead of taking up space on the road with a car, they just take up a tiny amount of space.\nCycling has also been becoming more and more popular in Toronto. The notion of no one is using the bike lanes is false. I have seen clips of more cyclist than cars on Bloor Street. We just never notice them because they are not large and not stuck in traffic!\nIf the government was serious in solving congestion then the number one thing would be to invest in public transit. Around 400,000 vehicles use highway 401 daily, which takes up an enormous amount of space. The Yonge subway gets over a million on a daily basis. Why hasn\u2019t the government answered why the Eglinton Crosstown hasn\u2019t opened up but they feel the need to remove some bike lanes? Every world class city has a solid cycling and public transit infrastructure. This bill is currently an embarrassment to the province.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is not being made in the interest of the people of Ontario. The provincial government should maintain their responsibilities at the provincial level, and allow municipalities to maintain their responsibilities in their municipal jurisdictions.\nIf municipalities need to seek provincial approval over infrastructure changes, this will only delay development and create greater inefficiencies in government. This will increase the costs of government and involve a greater number of government officials in decision making processes. I believed the conservative government was interested in reducing government involvement, and cutting red tape, but this bill is suggesting the complete opposite.\nPeople in cities and towns will ride bikes with or without bike lanes. If there is no dedicated bike lane, the bicyclists are put in great danger by being forced to ride among the vehicle traffic. This greatly increases the risk of accidents which could easily be fatal. Creating dedicated bike lanes will relieve the road vehicle traffic of immediate harm to bicyclists and will also create greater incentive for more people to ride bicycles, which would further relieve car traffic allowing drivers to get to their destinations more quickly.\nI don't support this bill and neither should any constituent of the conservative government. Save tax dollars, reduce provincial government involvement at the municipal level and incentivize traffic relief.\n"
