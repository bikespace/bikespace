        "comment": "As a property owner and taxpayer in Toronto, I would like to know that fair share of my tax dollars go to supporting my primary mode of transportation, which is riding a bicycle.\nThe city has tripled in size since I first moved here, but we don't have triple the roads. Even without bike lanes, we don't have enough road space for everyone to drive and park wherever they want whenever they want. So we must look into alternate forms of transportation, and we need to do it in a way that ensures the safety of people using those modes.\nWhen I do drive on city roads, I am happy to know that cyclists are safely out of my lane and the risk of injuring or killing someone are greatly reduced. I don't want to kill someone for the sake of 5 minutes off my drive.\n"

        "comment": "The proposed changes will increase pollution and not reduce travel times beyond a short term period. It will thereby worsen air quality and contribute to global warming which is our disrupting farmers' growing seasons.\nBuilding new highways will INDUCE DEMAND. The greater the road capacity of the system, the more people will be encouraged to drive, and thus any reduction in commute times will be short lived. This has been known for decades.\nThe requirement for municipalities to \"submit information about existing bike lanes on municipal roads where an existing vehicle lane was removed\" creates RED TAPE which will interfere with municipalities' ability to function and delay or impede the creation of bike lanes. Bike lanes are an essential part of the process of reducing our greenhouse gas emissions by encouraging Ontarians to switch from driving cars to bicycles. (While electric cars do not burn fuel in the same way, they still require large amounts of emissions to construct and ship.)\nThe proposed changes therefore violate the right of Ontarians to a clean air and a stable climate.\n"

I plan from now on the ask candidates about making Toronto a charter city and making this an issue in elections. In terms of bike lanes the evidence shows they are good for communities and good for business. Only one thing causes congestion; too many cars.\n"

There is no rational basis for the premise that removing bike infrastructure will reduce gridlock. Instead, the proposal appears to be an emotive appeal to suburbanite voters eager to blame traffic on groups they feel are politically opposed to them, rather than their own car-dependent lifestyles and increasingly larger trucks and SUVs.\n"

        "comment": "I am dismayed and discouraged to read about this proposal. My reasons to oppose this are:\n1. It will increase red tape for the provincial government, who say they are reducing red tape to get things done.\n2. It removes the power of municipalities to make decisions about cycling infrastructure. Municipalities are set up to make informed decisions for their citizens so why remove this power?\n3. The proposed changes will not reduce gridlock. Bike lanes are incredibly efficient at moving cyclists.\n4. We need to protected bike lanes to encourage more cyclists. Look at what major cities like Paris have done to make cities more cyclable.\n5. Adding traffic lanes is not the solution because of induced demand. Eventually more people will use cars further contributing to gridlock.\n6. Many people cycle because it is an inexpensive form of transportation. What will happen to the people who can\u2019t cycle any more and also can\u2019t afford cars or transit?\n7. Cycling infrastructure helps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Does Ontario intend to stay in \u201ccar is king\u201d mode for the next decade!\n"

        "comment": "While I understand the concerns that some may have regarding the construction of bike lanes, I believe that outright preventing or removing them from municipalities is a short-sighted approach. The Greater Toronto Area (GTA) is experiencing rapid population growth, and our current over-reliance on cars has led to increasing gridlock, pollution, and inefficiencies in how we move around large municipalities like Toronto.\nRather than eliminating bike lanes, we should be focusing on creating a more balanced transportation infrastructure that reduces our dependence on cars. This includes better integration of public transit, higher-density developments near transit hubs, and the promotion of active transportation options like cycling. Bike lanes play a crucial role in providing safe, accessible alternatives to driving, and they help alleviate congestion, especially in urban areas where road space is limited.\nA balanced approach also ensures that those who prefer to drive will benefit from reduced traffic. By providing viable alternatives for those who can't afford cars or who choose not to drive, such as cycling and public transit, we can decrease the number of vehicles on the road. This leads to smoother commutes for drivers as road congestion eases, benefiting everyone, regardless of their chosen mode of transportation.\nAs we look towards the future, it is essential to prioritize sustainable solutions that accommodate our growing population while reducing traffic and improving overall quality of life. By investing in multimodal transportation systems, we can build more livable, connected, and environmentally friendly cities.\nI urge you to consider the long-term benefits of bike lanes and to support a transportation strategy that addresses the root causes of gridlock: excessive car dependence and a lack of density alternatives.\n"

These allow for me to safely travel to and from work, and if they are closed, I'll be forced to take a car, which will increase traffic times. How is the legislation supposed to reduce gridlock?\n"

The only way to get cars off the road is to give people alternatives including economic incentives (either through a tax break for transit, or a gas tax or access tax for heavily traversed areas. Anything, anything! rather than taking away bike lanes.\n"

How about keep cyclists safe, and  promote the most efficient green ways to get around like cycling and walking.

        "comment": "This is laughably ignorant policy and absurd government overreach of the exact type that I thought conservatives were supposed to be opposed to. There was a time that (even as someone more progressive) I was excited about this government because it seemed committed to advancing evidence-based solutions to the challenges our province faced without too much regard for ideological posturing. Boy oh boy has team PC disabused me of that idea. What happened to municipalities knowing best what to do about land use as Premier Ford opined when explaining why he wouldn't force blanket upzoning across the province? What's with the double-standard?\nBike lanes have been implemented around the world and there is plenty of empirical evidence that could be evaluated to tackle this question. The record is fairly mixed: there are definitely instances of the addition of a cycle lane causing a small increase in travel times, and just as many examples of them having the opposite effect or none at all.\nWhat is very, very certain is that removing and blocking new bike lanes will not fix Toronto's congestion problem. There is not and will never be enough space on Toronto's roads for all of the people who would like to drive there. If you could wave a wand and triple the city's road capacity overnight, those lanes would fill up to be just as congested as we are right now, because the city is simply too dense to allow everyone who has the means to drive here the luxury of doing so.\nWhat actually fixes congestion is encouraging as many people as possible to use the more efficient modes of transportation those that are active and public.\n"
