        "comment": "Ministry of Transportation, Ontario\nRe: Bill 212 \u2013 Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024 (ERO #019-9266)\nTo whom it may concern,\nI am writing to express my views on the proposed Bill 212 and its implications for cycling infrastructure in Ontario, particularly in Toronto. I believe that supporting bike lanes is essential to ensure our cities are safe, accessible, and sustainable for all residents.\n1. Safety and Accessibility: Bike lanes are crucial in improving safety by providing a dedicated space for cyclists and reducing interactions with motor vehicles. Cycling infrastructure separates these two modes of transportation, reducing the risk of collisions and making roads safer for all. Furthermore, not all residents have the financial means to own or operate a vehicle, and many cannot legally drive, such as children, teens, and some seniors. Bike lanes offer an inclusive transportation option that is accessible to a wide range of people.\n2. Sustainability: As Canada works towards carbon reduction goals, encouraging sustainable transportation options is more important than ever. Bicycles produce zero emissions and occupy significantly less space than cars, making them ideal for reducing urban congestion and minimizing our environmental footprint. Supporting bike lanes aligns with our collective goals for sustainability and urban health.\n3. Local Autonomy: Toronto and other municipalities have unique transportation needs, which local governments are best positioned to understand and address. Local authorities should have the autonomy to decide on the infrastructure that serves their communities, rather than requiring provincial approval for changes or additions to bike lanes. Municipalities are closely attuned to residents' needs and should retain decision-making power in shaping their transportation networks.\nEncouraging the use of bicycles by protecting and expanding bike lanes provides Ontario\u2019s cities with numerous benefits, including safety, accessibility, sustainability, and a decrease in road congestion. I respectfully urge the Ministry of Transportation to reconsider aspects of Bill 212 and prioritize local control and sustainable transit options that are in line with our province\u2019s environmental and urban goals.\nThank you for considering my perspective.\n"

Cycling isn't just a personal choice for me\u2014it\u2019s part of my commitment to reducing congestion and pollution, and making the city more livable for everyone. By removing bike lanes, the bill would force cyclists like myself onto already crowded streets, significantly increasing the risk of accidents and safety hazards.\nThis move could also push people who rely on bikes as a sustainable transportation option back into cars, contributing to even more traffic and emissions, which is exactly what we should be trying to avoid. Bike lanes on streets like Bloor-Danforth have proven to be critical for safe and efficient commuting. These lanes are not just a convenience\u2014they\u2019re a lifeline for many of us, particularly those who don't have the option of driving.\nInstead of rolling back vital cycling infrastructure, the Ontario government should be investing in more bike lanes and improving the existing ones to support a healthier, greener, and less congested city. Cycling is an essential part of the solution to Toronto\u2019s growing congestion and climate crisis. I urge the government to reconsider this bill and prioritize the safety and well-being of cyclists and all commuters in our city.\nOr maybe we can just open the Eglinton & Finch LRT already?\n"

These seems politically driven.  I have voted conservative for the last 18 years but this is an embarrassment. My colleagues and friends from outside of the province are laughing at the mess this is going to cause including wasting money, causing more congestion and sadly more deaths!

        "comment": "As an avid recreational cyclist, I 100% agree with the Province of Ontario's plans to REMOVE the bike lanes on Bloor St, Yonge St & University Avenue.\nAll three of these streets have existing mass public transportation networks in the TTC Subway system to get people from point A to point B.  Working on Bloor St West in The Kingsway area, the bike lanes are grossly underused even when the weather is perfect for cycling.  Meanwhile, its now takes materially longer for traffic to move through the area which includes poorly marked turning lanes that are a hazard to both vehicles and cyclists (i.e. turning left from Bloor St W to Kings Lynn Blvd).  Emergency vehicles are also materially slower in getting through the area to get to the people they're trying to help.  The steep hill on Bloor St West by The Old Mill is a natural barrier to the mass use of bike lanes.  Investigate other options for bike lanes that are not above subway lines and not on main arteries.  We need to get traffic moving in this city.  The GTHA is the economic heartbeat of Canada and needs to be respected.  For the first time in my life, multiple people I know have emigrated from the GTHA for better living conditions elsewhere.  Toronto City Hall needs to understand that their decisions directly impact surrounding municipalities and the that adding to traffic congestion with rarely used bike lanes is not acceptable.\n"

        "comment": "This is just a terrible, terrible idea. There are more and more cyclists within the city, in particular riding e-bikes. They must be given room to be used.\nIn addition, usurping the authority of municipal politicians - the ones who are accountable and reactive to their city-dwelling residents - in favour of decisions of provincial politicians who do not represent ANYONE in the city corrupts the principles of representative democracy.\nAnd encouraging MORE gasoline vehicle traffic makes no sense from an environmental perspective. Climate change is real and hitting a crisis point. A proposal like this makes me feel that the Ford government is contemptuous and uncaring of the need to take action to combat climate change.\nThank you.\n"

One of the options is biking. Why are we removing bike lanes so that people from the suburbs can drive into the city. Study shows that increasing lanes do not decrease traffic, it actually increases traffic.\nRemoving bike lanes for parked cars is equivalent and worst for congestion. We should be removing parking non streets in favour of more bike lanes\n"

Personally, I\u2019ve noticed a huge difference in the newly built University Avenue bike lanes\u2014I can commute with a sense of security that wasn\u2019t there before. Bike lanes encourage eco-friendly commuting, reduce traffic congestion, and promote a healthier lifestyle. Removing them would undermine years of progress in making Toronto a bike-friendly city and discourage active transportation. Instead, we should invest in improving our public transportation and focus on delayed projects like the Eglinton LRT which is still not open to the public. That\u2019s where the province should be dedicating its efforts , not towards bike lanes that are functioning and saving lives.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly object to Bill 212\nThe construction of highway 413 will cause irreparable damage to valuable farm land and green spaces. I urge you to end this campaign to build more highway lanes through green space in Ontario.\nThe section of this bill referencing the removal of bike lanes goes against the will of the municipal voters who elected officials to represent their communities interests at the local level. Especially when the province is attempting to limit accessibility for those who cannot afford to drive or take transit.\nAs an Ontario voter and taxpayer who drives, cycles and works to protect our green spaces and farmland, I urge you to stop pushing for highway 413 and the removal of bike lanes in Toronto and other municipalities and to focus instead on bolstering public transit and the integrity of our greenbelt. The long-term quality of life of Ontarians depends on it.\n"

It would be an egregious waste of taxpayer money to remove these recently-installed bike lanes, and these lanes are critical pieces of infrastructure contributing to the safety of cyclists in this city.\nThis is a huge overreach. Municipal governments have the local knowledge and contextual understanding necessary to effectively address specific community transportation needs. Any provincial legislation that would limit municipalities from serving their communities ultimately undermines local governance and the ability of municipalities to protect the well-being of their residents. All levels of government have a clear public health obligation to ensure roadways are safe for all users.\n"

As a Registered Kinesiologist, I see first hand how important physical activity to the citizens of Ontario.  Cycling is accessible to many voters and should be encouraged.  However, many Ontarians are afraid to cycle given the lack of cycling infrastructure. Bike lanes save lives, encourage people to cycle and it does reduce congestion.  Many other countries can do it.  I think Ontario can too.  I ask as a voter, a promoter of good health and fitness and a cyclist to keep the bike lanes.\n"

Bike lanes are essential for encouraging more sustainable transportation options, reducing traffic congestion, and improving public health. By potentially reducing the number of dedicated bike lanes or making them less safe, this bill puts cyclists at risk and discourages people from cycling altogether. Cycling infrastructure should be prioritized, not undermined. This proposed legislation is not only a step backwards in terms of bike safety, but it also makes no sense financially. We\u2019ve already invested so much taxpayer money into creating and maintaining bike lanes across the city. Ripping out existing infrastructure would be a massive waste of those resources, all for the sake of reversing progress that has taken years to achieve. Instead of dismantling what we've built, we should be looking for ways to improve and expand it. Removing bike lanes that have already been paid for doesn\u2019t just hurt cyclists\u2014it\u2019s a poor use of public funds and a missed opportunity to build a more sustainable, safer, and accessible city for everyone.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes on our major city streets will be bad for business, increase commute times, and reduce access to the city for many people working downtown.\nBloor, Yonge and University are not major artery roads. They have been treated as such, but reality shows they are major shopping, health care and entertainment areas. The amount of cars trying to park on these roads proves this. We should stop treating them as major arteries as that is bad for business. Many BIA's have proven that bike lines have calmed traffic and brought in more customers. Major arteries are never a nice place to be. Who would want to shop on the Gardiner? Or Allen Road?\nAdditionally, research has time and time again proven that bike lines improve traffic. Induced demand on roads makes commuting times grow exponentially. Even if we can only convert 10% of car drivers to cyclists for inner city traffic to be cyclists, traffic and commute times will drop by 20%. This exponential increase is important when designing lanes. If we look at major traffic, it is often caused by intersection and exit-capacity. This will not be reduced or changed by adding bike lanes.\nBike lines do not belong on residential streets, as they are messy, hard to navigate, do not have the places we want to be (Bloor is a shopping and entertainment street, and thus a destination, not a through road).\nFor many people cycling is the only viable option. With cost of living being high, many cannot afford a car anymore. For inner city commutes it is the best and most flexible option. For many working off-hours it is the only option. Go take a look at the bike stands at Mt. Sinai hospital, or any hospital along University. The amount of bikes is exceeding the amount of cars at many hours of the day. It is the only way to commute for many nurses and doctors working at odd hours.\nWhat I know, when bike lanes along these streets are added I will:\na) take the lane. I will slow down cars by driving in the middle of the road. I have this right and it will be the only safe option.\nb) I will drive my car downtown, without an actual need to do so, it will be my only option. Cars cause traffic and commute times will significantly increase.\nBe very careful with this policy. It will cause massive grid lock and make the city a bigger mess than it already is.\nAdditionally I would like to comment on the STEAL LAND part of the act.\nWhy do we want to give the provincial government the ability to STEAL OUR PROPERTY. This sounds like a colonial measure and an act that you'd of DICTATORSHIP. The conservative party will be known as the Colonial party. I have no trouble advertising it as such among my peers if this bill will be pushed through.\n"
