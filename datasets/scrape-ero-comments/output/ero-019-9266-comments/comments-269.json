It\u2019s inappropriate.\nI also don\u2019t believe that putting cyclists in danger is worth the human cost. The province should be considering other public transit or other ways for people to get around that aren\u2019t car reliant. This will only negatively impact traffic in the long term as more people are forced to rely on vehicles to safely move around the city\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes on Bloor West, Yonge and University, as referenced in the amendment of October 31, 2024, will not reduce congestion, but will increase risk to public safety, and is an alarming move away from evidence-based practices. This proposal is counter to the 2024 Provincial Planning Statement, which includes several policies that support the use of bike lanes.\nAs for the suggestion that bike lanes should be on secondary roads, the primary challenge with an east-west route such as the Bloor-Danforth Cycle Track is that there is no viable secondary alternative. The Bloor-Danforth Cycle Track is a watershed achievement, increasing connections across the city for sustainable, healthy transportation \u2014 it also doubles the route of an efficient and affordable transit line. The western portion of the route is still in its trouble-shooting phase and traffic light timings are being adjusted. Instead of blowing the City's whole bike lane plan up, how about expressing concerns and let the City do its job.\nCongestion, in the GTHA especially, is at an all-time high, and there is consensus that action is needed to reduce traffic while recognizing the confines of limited space on roadways. Please work collaboratively with professionals with the understanding and expertise to create roadways that are safe for all road users and that provide people with multiple options to get around, including walking, cycling, public transit and driving.\nOver 120 physicians and researchers from the University of Toronto have called on The Ministry of Transportation to take responsibility for serving the people of Ontario, not its motor vehicles. They demand: \"We must address the root causes of traffic congestion and provide options for solutions, such as improved transit connectivity and reliability, incentives for choosing alternatives to motor vehicle travel, and support for complete streets that offer safe and efficient transportation options for all people.\nLegislation proposing to guide road design decisions, such as Bill 212, should explicitly place a higher priority on road safety than motor vehicle travel times. We oppose the proposed legislation as currently written and remain available should the government seek broader input from stakeholders of road traffic trauma \u2013 us and others \u2013 who aim to help improve traffic safety for everyone in Ontario.\"\nI'm quoting these people because they've done the research and understand the full picture of what's at stake. This amendment feeds grievance politics, targets vulnerable road users and adds to the already dangerous levels of road rage on our streets. The destruction of existing bicycle infrastructure puts lives at risk - not just on our roads - but through undermining efforts to address the dire impacts of climate change through clean, green, active transportation.\n"

More lanes are PROVEN to increase, not reduce, congestion.\nIf you live in a city like Toronto, USE PUBLIC TRANSIT, bike, or walk instead of trying to drive. Doug Ford needs to led transit and urban planners do their job and stop interfering!\n"

        "comment": "Frankly, I am furious at the idea of the province removing the bike lanes in Toronto. Toronto's bike infrastructure is the best of any city in Canada, and is such a major part of us being a world class city. Going backwards by wasting money on removing the bike lanes would be such an incredibly foolish decision. While I understand that not every visitor to Toronto has a bike, it is far easier to rent a bike than a car. It is far cheaper to commute by bike than by car. I can more comfortably spend more time and money in Toronto stores and restaurants by bike than by car, because car parking is always a huge hassle and expensive. Streets with bike lanes are quieter and more pleasant to actually shop in and visit. Cars are more dangerous to pedestrians. Being stuck in traffic sucks, but I do not believe for a second that removing bike lanes will meaningfully or enduringly improve this. The priority should be on getting human beings where they need to go, not just cars. I've watched the Bloor street bike lanes improve year after year, and am so incredibly proud of Toronto for having a truly functional bike lane network that other cities are envious of. This is a major overreach of the provincial government, and I am astounded that anyone thinks this is a good idea.\n"

Cycling is my main way of getting around the city and protected bike lanes make it safe and enjoyable to do so.  The idea that taking them away is a good thing is absolute nonsense.\nMore people will cycle if there is more infrastructure.  The more people who cycle means the less cars on the road.  It's pretty simple.\nPremier Ford should stay in his own lane and leave Toronto things to Toronto.\n"

        "comment": "Biking in Toronto is often dangerous. I am always scared when I have my child on my bike on most streets. When we go to ROM or I take my kid to school, I feel much safer with the protected bike lane on Bloor and other streets and I no longer drive to go there, reducing traffic for those that need to drive. I pay massive taxes, please keep a safe way for me to navigate Toronto. We have a car, biking lets our family live with one instead of two cars, and lets me get a bit of exercise - between a stressful career and being a parent, it\u2019s one of the few ways I\u2019m able to move consistently.\n"

        "comment": "I am strongly opposed to this proposal, which would not only restrict local authority over bike lane projects but also potentially lead to the wasteful removal of recently completed bike lanes. Municipalities across Ontario have already invested significant resources, time, and taxpayer money into building these bike lanes, which have demonstrated clear safety and environmental benefits. To dismantle this infrastructure now, only to revert back to vehicle lanes, is fiscally irresponsible and undermines public trust.\nThis proposal gives the impression of prioritizing the interests of a few at the expense of public funds and community well-being. Requiring municipalities to obtain provincial approval to build new bike lanes and compelling data collection on existing ones seems designed to discourage the development of active transportation infrastructure. These steps appear to benefit those who would gain from car-centric policies, which raises concerns about whose interests are truly being served.\nAdditionally, the prioritization of Highway 413\u2014a project opposed by environmentalists and local communities\u2014suggests that the province may be prioritizing development that serves private interests over the environmental and social well-being of Ontarians. Ontario needs responsible, forward-thinking infrastructure that aligns with our environmental goals, reduces urban sprawl, and promotes sustainable growth.\nI urge the government to reconsider these measures and respect the investments already made by municipalities in sustainable transportation. Instead of spending public funds to undo completed projects, Ontario should focus on expanding green infrastructure that serves all citizens equitably and ethically.\n"

        "comment": "It is important to look at different ways to reduce traffic and that's worth praising. Removing bike lanes however is not one of them. In fact adding more lanes creates what is known in transportation industry \"induced demand\" were more drivers will come to use them. Case in point is the newly renovated and expanded 401 hwy between Mississauga and Kitchener where traffic congestion has increased despite all the great work and expansion.\nInstead of reinventing the wheel, let's have a look at how other European and North American cities have tackled the problem of congestion.\nBest regards\n"

If they are removed, my commute will take significantly longer if I need to cycle around pedestrians, or will become significantly more unsafe if I need to cycle on the street. Or, I will need to drive to work, adding to current congestion. In no scenario will this bill save me time on my daily commute.\n"

However, to have the government actively rip out safe street infrastructure is totally unacceptable as a tax paying citizen. Far too many lives have already been lost and removing bike lanes on Yonge, Bloor and University will increase the risk of injury and death for all road users. I plead with the government to withdraw this bill before it's too late.\n"
