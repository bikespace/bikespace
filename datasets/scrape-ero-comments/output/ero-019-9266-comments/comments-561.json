        "comment": "As an avid toronto cyclist, I do not approve of the removal of bike lanes on Bloor St, Yonge St, and University Ave. These are routes that many other cyclists and I depend on for safe and efficient travel through the city. With the removal of bike lanes along these streets, and no viable alternative bike lanes along these lines, cyclists will have to continue to use these streets in unsafe conditions\u2014 thus increasing risk for the cyclists, motorists, and pedestrians. Please protect the existing bike lanes in toronto and work to supplement them with more routes. Our city needs to emphasize bike safety and removing some of the most used, replied upon, and convenient bike lanes is contrary to that principle. Cyclist safety BEFORE motorist convenience. Thank you.\n"

Removing these bike lanes will be a costly and ineffective measure.\nThe only benefit of removing bike lanes is for political gain. This is not a helpful measure - more people are being added to Toronto and this is set to increase as more apartments and condos are built. Bike lanes and transit infrastructure move people around the city effectively, removing bike lanes does not, even if you would create another lane for traffic it is not an effective measure. This is extremely clear and established information.\nI say this as someone who biked on bloor before the bike lanes it was not safe.\n"

Instead off focusing on things Ontarians need, we have to deal with a government hell bent on taking away the rights of Ontarians. To try to circumvent the expropriation act is both highly illegal and deeply unwanted by anyone other than this ruling party's donor class. None of your constituents are asking for this act, end the entire thing now and stop wasting more of my money, you don't deserve it if this is all you can come up with.\n"

        "comment": "Please do not remove Ontario bike lanes, I often use the bike lanes and consider them critical transportation infrastructure. I often use the bike lanes even if it makes my trips longer, as I prefer a safe trip over a fast one.\nIf the bike lanes are removed this will not stop people from cycling. People will always ride bicycles, and the rise of meal delivery apps has ensured they will only continue to grow as a transportation option. If the bike lanes are unavailable cyclists will be forced to take a car lane as cycling on sidewalks is illegal and unsafe. If bikes are forced to take the car lane this will only make traffic worse, cars will be stuck behind bikes, cars will get impatient and try to swerve back into the left lane to go around the cyclist. Cars swerving around cyclists will make traffic worse and endanger the lives of cyclists and drivers.\nI have worked as a bike courier in the past, I remember car traffic from before the bike lanes were constructed, I've also had to drive through busy Toronto traffic. Driving traffic going through the core of Toronto has always been bad, this is part of what encouraged me to become a cyclist. I do not feel that traffic has gotten worse since the installation of bike lanes, and I'm happy to have a safer option then cycling down roads without bicycle infrastructure.\nI believe cycling would be more popular in Toronto if the network of bike lanes were more thoroughly interconnected. At the moment I feel that cycling in Toronto is still dangerous as trips often involve travelling between safe cycling areas and actual destinations which are often outside these areas. I think taking away the existing infrastructure is a step in the wrong direction. I have an overwhelming sense of pride being a Torontonian, and it hurts me deeply that we would consider endangering the lives of our cyclists to prioritize expediting travel for motor vehicles. These are peoples lives and physical safety! The travel time of motor vehicles being plus or minus 10-20 minutes should not even be considered if it's coming at the cost of peoples lives and safety.\n"

Numerous studies show that bike lanes improve traffic flow, cars make it worse.\nEmergency vehicles can drive in bike lanes but they cannot drive in a lane packed with cars.\nAlso, nice try hiding the actual thing behind rage-inducing bike-removing legislation. It is obvious this is more about getting highway 413 thru and destroying a bunch of nature so that more cars can sit in traffic than about bike lanes themselves.\nStop this nonsense with cars and highways, build mass transit and bike lanes.\nCheck calendar, it is 2024, not the 60s.\n"

        "comment": "I am strongly opposed to this proposal. With the cost of living increase fewer people in the city can even afford cars much less pay to fuel them. Others prefer riding bikes because it is the greener option. There are numerous studies that indicate the more roads you build the more you fill, so I don\u2019t believe another traffic lane would reduce gridlock. We will just have more cars on the road. And in a world where climate change is a real threat, how can that be seen as progress? Bike lanes save lives, give people greener and cheaper options for getting around our city, and also keep the populace active. This should be a city for people, not cars.\n"

It locks in a system where in most communities, cars are the only possible mode of transportation. It creates unnecessary bureaucracy, and most importantly, it takes away a possible tool in fighting climate change and all the resulting harm to our communities and to the planet. While this will harm all Ontarians, it comes across as a pety, mean-spirited attack on some percieved enemies in Toronto.\n"

        "comment": "I live in the Netherlands. To me it seems crazy to propose the removal of bike lanes. Because of all the bike infrastructure and public transport options here, I do not need a car. My regular commute is an hour each way by bike. I love to see the scenery change day by day and it is nice to have some exercise built in to my schedule. Not having good cycling infrastructure would force me to commute by car, which would be worse for my mental and physical health.\nWhere I live, the majority of short trips (up to 7.5 km) are done by foot (27%) and bicycle (40%). This includes things like going to a grocery store, a gym, a bar, a friends place , ... . Being able to do these trips by bike means there are fewer cars on the road, so there is less congestion. It is basically impossible to cause a gridlock with bikes. I know of only a single place where bikes bundle up, and that is because of the intersection with cars.\nThe aim of the bill is to reduce gridlock, however the proposed method of turning bike lanes into car lanes will not achieve that. The main bottleneck of a road network is intersections, not roads. Adding more lanes makes intersections more complicated and thus have longer light cycles. Drivers switching lanes will cause drivers behind them to brake, thus slowing down traffic. Furthermore, the many people cycling already - even though your cycle network is far from complete - will be forced to drive again. This will further worsen the gridlock.\n"

        "comment": "This bill will kill commuters. This bill won't save any time or reduce gridlock. Cyclists can use the lane regardless of an official bike lane, this will simply reduce cars in the live lane to the speed of any bicycle that's in front of them.\nThis is government overreach, anti-small government, anti-freedom, and anti-democracy.\nThis bill is to further land theft from Ontarians by the Ford Conservative government. Ford's highway has exorbitant costs and little support, and this bill will help him steal land to build it. It's the Green Belt scandal all over again and I'm sure it will have its own RCMP investigation in the future, too.\n"
