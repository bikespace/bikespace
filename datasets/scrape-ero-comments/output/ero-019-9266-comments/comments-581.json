        "comment": "I do not think it's wise to remove bikes lanes. The provincial government should not be concerned with making drivers' lives marginally easier at the cost at of everyone else in the city, instead they should be focused on making transit options more viable - making them more accessible, more frequent, more enticing.\nThe logic would and should be that the more people you have using public transit, the less cars there would be on the road, removing gridlock and making room on the road for those that need to drive into the city.\nThe majority of the people in downtown cores can easily access amenities they need through walking and public transit - therefore it makes no sense to waste taxpayer money to remove something a good amount of people use, and if protected they are protected bike lanes, they can keep people safe, too.\nSomething to think on - if you only have one lane to drive in, you can't have impatient drivers weaving in and out of lanes potentially causing an accident that leads to more gridlock.\nThere are solutions available, I do not think this proposal is one of them. The province should not be intervening in a municipality's decision on infrastructure especially when I've watched a certain premiere in a news clip riding his bike and stating how unsafe it felt to be sharing the road with downtown drivers, that bike lanes are the way to go. They have an entire province to take care of and there are higher priorities to be addressed.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is deeply upsetting to me and I feel I must speak up as it affects me personally because I am a cyclist. I've only been cycling since the start of the COVID pandemic and have fallen in love with this method of transportation since I have found it to be liberating and empowering. As a woman, I plan my trips around accessibility to bike lanes because it's the only way I feel safe getting around on my own power.  When I bike from point A to point B, I inevitably make stops along the way at businesses that are on my route and I find this easy and convenient and it's not something I would do if I were taking transit. I have never been a driver and so for me this is also an issue of accessibility and affordability. Having a vehicle is a privilege many of us don't have and we cannot be passed over in favor of those who drive. It is infuriating that bike lanes are being blamed for problems that are actually complex and mostly caused by car density. The benefits of cycling are not only personal (including time efficiency, financial savings, and physical exercise for better health), but also social and environmental. We need our elected leaders to inspire us all to do better and be better for the good of our communities, our cities and the world, one person at a time. Cycling should be encouraged and given the credit it deserves in helping fight some of the issues our cities face such as traffic gridlock. Bike lanes are not part of the problem, they are part of the solution. It does take time to see change, but if you build it they will come. The more visibility we have around bike lanes, the more people will be encouraged to bike. Moving bike lanes to secondary roads sends the message that cyclists are second class citizens that don't deserve the convenience of main thoroughfares or direct routes. It is also ridiculous that after the inconvenience of detours and gridlock due to construction of the newest bike lanes on Bloor, Doug Ford is suggesting we should endure this all over again just so that the street would go back to how it was. This is an enormous waste of money and not how I want my tax dollars to be spent. Societies are meant to move forwards not backwards. This bill 212 does not take us forward and it cannot pass.\n"

        "comment": "I drive every day, and honestly, I don't want to share the road with cyclists. I find it frustrating when they're in my way, slowing me down and making my drive more stressful. There were times I wished I could just get them off my road entirely.\nBut then I realized there might be a solution that works for both of us: building dedicated bike lanes with physical barriers. This way, cyclists have their own space, and they\u2019re not suddenly swerving into my lane, risking an accident. With protected bike lanes, I can pass them confidently, without the constant worry of having to keep an awkward distance or follow strict regulations.\nIn Ontario, the law requires that drivers keep at least 1 meter of distance when passing a cyclist. But my eyes are not a measuring tape, and judging that exact distance can be challenging. Because of that, I tend to give cyclists an even wider berth just to be sure I'm following the law. With protected bike lanes, I don't have to worry about guessing those distances\u2014cyclists are safe in their own lane, and I can drive freely and comfortably, knowing we're all staying within our boundaries. It\u2019s the kind of compromise that could make driving smoother for everyone.\n"

        "comment": "Ford and conservatives are lying about the detrimental effects of bike lanes. In an October town hall, Deputy Fire Chief Jim Jessop responded by explaining that according to the data, emergency response times have actually improved since the Bloor bike lanes were installed.\nI am a commute to work on my bike, my kid goes to school on his bike. I feel safe when I can use a bike lane. The roads and driver of Toronto are aggressive and bike lanes protect cyclists. I am also a driver and I feel more at ease when there is separation between my car and cyclists. If you want to improve traffic, improve mass modes of transport so that people use them instead of driving. Your hatred on cyclists is unfounded and misguided neither traffic or businesses are suffering because of bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "Hi. I use bike lanes almost everyday. When there is no bike lane like on yonge below bloor, bay above college, or spadina, I am forced to ride in the traffic, not fun for me or for the driver. I try my best to avoid these routes and stay on the bike lane where possible. But if you delete the uni ave bike lane then it becomes more difficult for me to do that.\nCurrently, toronto has a usable bike lane system. That is to say, there is much room for improvement. When we have a more connected bike lane system, when it becomes easier to get to most destinations on the bike (without having to mingle with cars), it will incentivize people to ride more. The 3 feet bike lane can carry more traffic than a 10 feet car lane on certain days. The bike lane also gives people choice in regards to which way they choose to travel. Way easier to park a bike too.\nI will always support the government that supports a bikeable neighborhood.\n"

        "comment": "In the 2023-24 fiscal year, the government of Ontario will invest $8.6 billion into public transit and $3.3 billion into provincial highways. From this, it's clear that the province is committed to making transportation faster, safer, and more affordable for all Ontarians, regardless of which mode they choose. However, by removing bicycle lanes in downtown Toronto, Bill 212 works against this goal by unreasonably favouring cars, public transit, and walking over cycling.\nWhile the average travel speed by car during peak periods in downtown Toronto is only 18 km/h and the average speed of the streetcars can be as low as 9 km/h, bikes generally travel at around 16 km/h. Thus, in the city centre, the speed of bicycles are comparable to other modes of transport but without the need to wait at a station or find a parking garage. Therefore, discouraging cycling will lengthen travel times rather than shortening them. In addition, replacing bicycle lanes with parking or more traffic lanes will allow more cars to drive through the city centre instead of bypassing it, making the streets more dangerous for the high volumes of cyclists and pedestrians in downtown. The overall effect of replacing the bike lanes in Toronto's city centre with traffic lanes will be to increase the number of traffic accidents while making it slower and less affordable to get around. In the city centre, it is especially important to achieve a healthy modal share, which is why the government of Ontario needs to take a more balanced approach to transportation by investing in cycling infrastructure, just like it has done for public transit and highways.\n"

        "comment": "The fact that the bike lanes are being placed as the forefront argument, with the ability to land grab present in the bill being hidden away is deplorable. Moreover, the idea that the new highway 413 would be free from environmental impact assessments is even more diabolical, and evidence of money being thrown around against the people, rather than for the people. In a world increasingly effected by environmental changes and global warming, looking to rip out bike lanes is short-minded. Bike lanes offer greater freedom for movement, straying away from pollution of car, and offer greater health benefits in an increasingly unhealthy world. Save the rights of Ontarians and do not let this pass through.\n"

        "comment": "As a small business owner, parent, pedestrian and frequent driver, I\u2019m writing to urge the government to reconsider this costly and dangerous proposal to tear up existing Toronto cycling infrastructure (and especially bike lanes on Bloor, Yonge & University). Bike lanes save lives, drive foot traffic and make urban areas more livable. Car congestion was terrible before the bike lanes and isn\u2019t materially worse since they went in. Because cars cause congestion. Not bikes. Encouraging citizens to make a more environmentally friendly, cost conscious transportation choice that is also proven to have preventative health benefits (reducing the drain on the public health system) is smart, people-focused, forward thinking policy. Please don\u2019t take this city backwards.\n"

This vilification of bike lanes and not taking the larger issues of poor urban planning into play, looks exactly what it\u2026 political scapegoating.

        "comment": "To the Environmental Policy Office,\nI am writing to express my strong opposition to Bill 212, which seeks to remove crucial bike infrastructure in Toronto and halt the development of new bike lanes. I am currently studying at OISE with the goal of teaching in the Toronto District School Board, and I see cycling infrastructure as vital to Toronto's sustainable growth, response to climate change, and the mobility and safety of its residents. I regularly use the Bloor Street bike lanes to get to school and would be heartbroken to see such a wonderful addition to our city be removed so hastily.\nCycling is an essential part of our city\u2019s transportation ecosystem, offering an environmentally friendly, affordable, and healthy alternative to car-based transit. Removing bike lanes, as proposed in Bill 212, would discourage cycling and intensify gridlock by forcing more residents back into cars. Studies repeatedly show that increased cycling infrastructure can alleviate traffic congestion rather than worsen it. For example, a 2016 study conducted by the FLOW Project found that New York bike lanes had minimal impacts on congestion and even improved travel times in some corridors. In the 2019 City of Toronto Cycling Study, the vast majority of those surveyed (including residents of North York, Scarborough, and Etobicoke) stated that they want to travel more by bicycle. Residents are continually pushed into car travel due to concerns over cycling safety, which will almost certainly be exacerbated by removing essential and safe cycling infrastructure on Bloor, Yonge, and University.\nKeep in mind, Toronto has committed to ambitious climate action goals through its TransformTO Net Zero Strategy, targeting net-zero emissions by 2040. Expanding bike infrastructure is essential to achieving these goals. Active transportation reduces reliance on fossil fuels, directly supporting Toronto\u2019s climate action strategy. Limiting or removing bike lanes runs counter to these commitments and undermines the city\u2019s environmental leadership.\nFurthermore, the lack of bike lanes disproportionately affects lower-income residents and young people, who may rely on cycling as an affordable and accessible mode of transportation. Cutting down bike lanes limits their mobility, amplifies inequalities, and creates further dependence on costly and sometimes unreliable public transit options.\nBill 212 threatens Toronto\u2019s progress toward a sustainable, resilient future. Investing in safe, efficient cycling infrastructure is not merely a financial expense but an essential commitment to public health, equity, and environmental stewardship. Access to safe transportation should be a universal right, not a partisan issue. This bill is a blatant attempt to serve the premier\u2019s political ambitions rather than the best interests of Toronto\u2019s residents. I urge the committee to consider the long-term impact of this legislation and advocate for expanding\u2014not dismantling\u2014Toronto\u2019s cycling infrastructure.\nSincerely,\nA Concerned Toronto Resident\n"
