        "comment": "Please reconsider this ill-advised and dangerous legislation.\nBased on information that was made public just last week, we've reconfirmed that removing these bike lanes is not an evidence based proposal to achieve the government's objectives. It will: cost 10s of millions of dollars to tax payers; will not solve congestion issues that Toronto experiences and at least during the construction period, make them much worse; and finally and most importantly will result in more injury, death and property damage.\nAs an individual who both drives and bikes on bloor st. daily, it is tragic to think that constructions on many parts was just completed some months ago and we will all be thrown back into the chaotic state that the roads were for the past year.  Transportation is such an important issue, please focus on real projects that will actually address these issues such as getting the Eglington LRT MOVING; building the Ontario line, building more highways, subsidizing the 407, even doing a real study into traffic patterns. This legislation is based on anecdotal experiences of a few - it is clear that the bike lanes have made driving less chaotic and stressful and are making it safer for everyone.\nBiking is better for our health, it is better for our environment, it is better for our mental health. Please reconsider.\n"

        "comment": "I am appalled at the decision of the Ford government to propose Bill 212 which aims to remove bike lanes within the heart of downtown Toronto. The statistic announced by the Ford government that only 1.2% of people in Toronto commute by bicycle has been contested and fact-checked by many sources, including by the city's own collected data, and found to be a misrepresentation of cycling and the use of bike lanes within Toronto. Even from purely an economic standpoint, the cost to taxpayers to remove the bike lanes appears as if it would be at least $75 million in direct and sunk costs and I would argue that this money would be better spent on a plethora of other services. As well, the City has reported an increased ridership level of up to 600% in some of the bike lanes identified for removal and believes that the removal of the lanes will have a minimal effect on car travel times or traffic congestion. The position that more car lanes will decrease traffic congestion or commute time has been disproven time and time again by urban studies and to see this argument used as the foundation of this bill is concerning and confidence-shaking. Looking at the bigger picture in consideration of climate change and the role of the Ontario government in mitigating emissions as well as building \"greener\" infrastructure, the proposal to remove bike lanes and prioritize car vehicle transportation is short-sighted and a disservice to our shared environment as well as future generations. I hope that the bill is reconsidered and revoked.\n"

        "comment": "This bill represents another instance of confusing a city street and a road, as exemplified by the inclusion of proposing the removal of several Toronto bike lanes on STREETS. Streets should be places form people - to gather, shop, walk, and create value for the local community. A great example of this is Bloor Street.\nA ROAD is something that is for moving cars between two places. Bloor Street is not a road. Cars do not buy things, or congregate, or add value, yet removing bike lanes will turn a nice place into a car centric highway that is just to move people from A to B, meaning less shopping, less gathering, and less adding value to the community.\nListen to the Bloor Annex BIA (not to mention all the other planning, Mayoral, and business organizations) that have spoken against this proposed legislation, including the decades of data to show this legislation will only make congestion and safety worse.\n"

It is caused by insufficient public transit and a ballooning population.\nCycling is healthy, environmentally sustainable, and cheap. Building a strong cycling network (like Paris, London, New York and countless other top rate big cities have done) will help Toronto move forward with innovative, community-minded initiatives. Removing them is a massive and unnecessary expense which pushes Toronto backward and will do absolutely nothing to improve traffic downtown.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is such an awful idea. PLEASE do not go forward with this change. You will kill people with these changes. Cyclists will die.\nI live in Toronto and use the Bloor Street bike lanes and the University bike lanes almost daily. Cycling is my main mode of transit. I used to drive my car everywhere (as I grew up in Oshawa) but after moving to Toronto in 2018 I now am able to walk and cycle everywhere. Riding a bike is always the fastest option in Toronto, the most enjoyable, and actually the cheapest option for the city of toronto to maintain. All of my friends and I are able to ride our bikes. I want to have a child soon and I am deeply afraid of taking them onto any roads that don't have a bike lane. I have always though that the new university bike lanes would be one of the only bike lanes I would trust given the amount of space they provide. If you tear up these bike lanes and prevent more from being made, I honeslty don't know if I can stay in this province. You will see more folks slowly leave our city and our province and go to BC and to Quebec as these provinces are looking forward rather than looking back to the 1960s.\nPlease smarten up.\n"

        "comment": "I am opposed to the government's proposal to remove existing bike lanes and to remove the right of municipalities to make decisions around installing bike lanes.\nI own a car, but rarely drive in the city. I have no desire to drive in the city. I grew up in small-town Ontario and got my driver's license as soon as I turned 16, but biking is my preferred mode of transportation. It is more affordable; it helps keep me in shape; and it is better for the environment. It is also, often, a faster way of getting around locally.\nThere is no data that this proposal will improve car traffic. In fact in the long run it would very likely worsen it. The only way to improve traffic is to make it easier for people to happily choose not to drive. The more people who opt to cycle, walk, and take public transit for local trips, the more space there will be for people to really need to use a car.\nIt is a terrible waste of taxpayer dollars. I would much rather see the millions of dollars that would be needed to remove bike lanes put towards public transit, either local or regional. (The Go Train between Toronto and Kitchener, for example, doesn't run on the weekends. Driving to Kitchener is awful. I would happily choose the train over driving if I could, which would free up space for others who need to use the road.)\nIn the coming years Toronto is only going to become denser. The Province supports building more, much needed housing to address the housing crisis, which is great. However, as more people come to live in the City, many of them will opt not to drive. It is imperative that we improve public transit and ensure safe active transportation options.\nAs e-bikes grow in popularity, more people will opt to cycle instead of drive, even in the winter. E-bikes are serving the local economy as they support deliveries of food and other products, again, reducing the need for extra cars on the road. They are not going to go away. Having safe cycling infrastructure is also great for tourism. Biking is a great way for visitors to see a city.\nThe Province should not interfere so grossly with municipal issues.\nWe need to ensure the safety of cyclists and pedestrians. Dedicated bike lanes help achieve this.\nWe know that there are all sorts of issues that impact traffic. The Province needs to take a more holistic approach to responsibly dealing with them.\n"

        "comment": "I am asking you to remove the bike lane section of this Act.\nBill 212 represents unprecedented jurisdictional overreach that would limit where municipalities can build new bike lanes. Local governments \u2013 and not the province \u2013 are best equipped to make these kinds of decisions\u00a0about rebalancing our streets and giving people more transportation options.\nIn cities and towns across Ontario, people want a more vibrant and friendlier public realm. They know that easing traffic congestion is about giving people\u00a0more\u00a0transportation options, not fewer. Ontarians want to achieve net zero for a greener, healthier future and want their communities to be connected so that not every trip to school, to the store, or to work has to be taken by car.\nAs part of their Climate Emergency plans, many Ontario municipalities are in the planning phases of expanding active transportation options like cycling which will help us get around our small towns and will connect smaller communities to each other. This will make our communities more resilient and will respond to the urgent need to reduce our massive and growing GHG emissions by getting people out of cars and into more healthy forms of transport..\nWith respect to Toronto, as an international city it is so far behind other great cities in providing for safe cycling options to get around the city. Personally, I fear for the lives of my adult children who cycle to work and shopping in Toronto. Most lanes are not separated from dangerous car and truck transportation. Cyclists are killed every year by car drivers. Rather than tearing out lanes that have been made safe and have provided more revenue for shops along those routes, MORE LANES MUST BE ADDED.\nI would argue that cars do not need to travel along Bloor and Yonge streets at all. Of all the streets in Toronto, they are the best served by public transit. Thousands of cyclists a day travel along these streets. In comparison, many fewer cars use these streets, so why would anyone remove bike lanes there?\nI object to the misleading statistics which are being used to justify this wrong-headed addendum to Bill 212. Your own Ontario study shows over 5% of folks in Toronto cycle and the number grows each year. Missing is the rest of the equation: how many people walk, how many take public transit, and how many drive in the areas where there are bike lanes? That would give us the true picture.\nAdditionally, the space required by each type of transportation needs to be looked at. Cars take up the lion\u2019s share of the urban space and generally are only moving one or two people. It is the cars which cause congestion, not wide sidewalks, bike lanes or buses. Cars not only use more than their share of space on roadways but also need two parking spaces \u2013 one at each end of the journey. This is extremely inefficient use of urban space.\nProviding a variety of transportation options will reduce congestion. Also, congestion fees have been shown to cut congestion in other cities when sufficient alternate ways to move around are provided.\n\u2022\tBike lanes are good for business\n\u2022\tThey\u2019re good for the environment\n\u2022\tThey cut greenhouse gas pollution\n\u2022\tThey help us reach our climate targets\n\u2022\tThey\u2019re good for public and personal health\n\u2022\tThey give us freedom and mobility\n\u2022\tBike lanes save lives\nI\u2019m including a link to the story of Alex Amato\nGeorge and Karen Amaro\u2019s daughter Alex Amaro was tragically killed while riding her bike on Dufferin Street in December of 2020. Alex, who was on her way home from the Dufferin Mall after buying a chocolate bar and an extension cord for her Christmas tree, was struck by three cars that evening. On Thursday, the Amaro family spoke with CBC\u2019s Metro Morning and their message was simple: \u201cbike lanes could have saved our daughter\u201d\n"

        "comment": "It is inappropriate for the Ontario Government to micromanage the city of Toronto, which is larger than several provinces in Canada. The city council which represents small sections of the city is a better judge of what the city's needs are. The bike lanes in question are near two universities filled with students who use bicycles for transportation  because not only can they not afford a car, there is no place to park. There are over 60,000 students at the University of Toronto ( the largest in Canada) and almost 50,000 at TMU. Public transportation is too slow and doesn't take them where they have to travel within the campuses. It would be dangerous for them to try to travel in the same lanes as cars.\nIf the Province does this against the wishes of the City, the Province should pay the costs. This is money that could be better spent on healthcare or feeding hungry people in the city.\n"

        "comment": "Good Day,\nI would like to express my severe disappointment with Bill 212, specifically, 4 Part XII of the Act being amended to require \"Ministry approval of bicycle lanes...\" construction and that the \"Ministry may review existing bicycle lanes\" such as the proposed removal of bicycle lanes on Bloor St. West in Toronto.\nThis is a regressive policy that:\n     1. Will not remedy or alleviate the current traffic congestion in Toronto or other municipalities in Ontario (Please see attached Globe and Mail article in the 1st URL).\n2. Will directly and indirectly result in the deaths and injuries of more citizens who choose active transportation as their mode of transportation to work or any other destination (Please see second URL from the organization People for Bikes).\nThe 1st URL attached is an article from the Globe recently that cited many experts and studies in the area of traffic congestion. The overarching theme and takeaway from the article is that the increased congestion is due to:\n1. Cars being larger in size and taking up more space on the road\n2. Bottlenecks within the city causing huge back-ups of traffic\n3. Constant construction causing road closures\nNowhere in this article are bicycle lanes cited as being a main cause of increased congestion. Can you explain why that is? Despite your stance within this Bill regarding bicycle lanes?\nActive transportation users are already challenged enough across Ontario especially in Toronto with the infrastructure that currently exists. Your proposal  will result in more people being harmed and killed by drivers. In the second attached URL, the page from People For Bikes in the US quotes an article that states \"Protected bike lanes reduce bike-related intersection injuries by about 75 percent compared to comparable crossings without infrastructure.\"\nActive transportation by bike is important to REDUCE congestion in municipalities. It is simple, 1 less person on a bicycle means 1 less car. As a reminder, bicycles are smaller than cars. Additionally, a bicycle reduces smog and pollution versus a car. If a person does not feel safe riding a bicycle on a city street without a protected bike lane(or any bike lane) they will not ride. And the argument of just re-distributing the lanes to other streets or routes is not feasible. People have to get to certain high traffic destinations(such as businesses on Bloor St) and MUST use that corridor.\nFinally, with this lack of effectiveness in mind, it can be deduced that the provincial government is enacting this amendment only to create an illusion of action on traffic congestion within the city. It is simply to appeal to citizens anger in regards to traffic congestion and the wait times they encounter in their vehicle. This is a gross misuse of power to gain votes and the government employees who are pushing this should seriously reflect on their civic duty and that they are serving the citizens of Ontario, not Doug Ford.\nPlease reconsider Bill 212, specifically, 4 Part XII of the Act being amended and listen to the hundred of thousands of Ontario citizens voicing their discontent over this.\nSincerely\nAlex L.\n"

These decisions should remain the sole purview of municipal governments and the citizens who have elected them. The provincial government has no business meddling in these decisions.\nAt a time when climate change is wreaking havoc it is imperative that we make it as easy as possible for municipalities and indeed all levels of government to accelerate progress toward offering safe alternative non-polluting forms of transportation in our towns and cities. Bike lanes are a vital piece of infrastructure that allow citizens to move about their towns and cities safely. They do not cause gridlock; they help ease gridlock.  The evidence is there to support this. The more bike lanes we have the more people will get out of their cars and cycle safely. We need bike lanes, not less, as soon as possible.\nI would implore the provincial government to leave these decisions to municipalities.\nThis is a regressive, anti-democratic piece of legislation which smacks of \"nanny state\".

Bike lanes allow for a safe alternative for short inner city trips. Bike lanes allow for a safe alternative for those who do not own or cannot afford a car. Bike lanes reduce air and noise pollution. Bike lanes are more efficient at keeping up with the demands of moving large amounts of people.\nI think this is a major regression for the lives of those who live in the city and is embarrassing. This shows that we are not building for the people who live in Toronto but the cars who live in Toronto. While cities such as Paris move towards a more efficient and safer environment for people this bill leads me to believe that we are living in the past.\n"
