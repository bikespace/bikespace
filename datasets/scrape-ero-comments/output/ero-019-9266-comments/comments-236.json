This will do nothing to improve traffic and will only put cyclists in danger as critical infrastructure is removed.\nPlease stop wasting your time on petty political vendettas and focused on delivering the critical public transportation infrastructure necessary to actually make navigating the city and provide better.\n"

Bike lanes enhance urban environments by improving safety for cyclists, reducing traffic congestion, and lowering air pollution. They promote physical health by encouraging active transportation, boost local economies by increasing foot traffic, and foster community connectivity.\n"

        "comment": "Although it may seem counterintuitive, building more lanes and removing bike lanes is not really a solution to congestion. When you build more roads and remove bike lanes, you essentially force everyone into a car, and because Trudeau's immigration policies keep bringing more people in, then all those people need to get in cars, which causes....more congestion. This is an experience proved time and time again - whether its here with the QEW lane expansion, in Texas with the freeway expansions, and all around the world.  Induced demand is real, and somehow we keep ignoring it. Really, the only solution is to build alternatives for driving - bike lanes, density and transit lines - although it seems counterintuitive, it works in making people not need to get in a car and drive around.\nI am a commuter, PC voter, and I love to \"smash the libs\" just as much as the next conservative, but blowing taxpayer money to increase the amount of cars on the roads and remove bikers is not a smart idea and not a good use of funds. I would encourage the PCs to reconsider this plan and consider better alternatives to reducing congestion, like increasing alternatives to driving.\n"

Bike lanes save lives, are a more efficient way of moving in the city, are better for local businesses, are better for the house economy (compare costs of owning and mantaining a car vs public transportation vs biking). All of this is  supported by experts, start listening to experts for the greater good and stop politizicing everything, benefiting the wealthier ontarians only.\n"

        "comment": "The statements in this proposal are simply the opinions of the Premier and Minister and have no factual backing. Not only do bike lanes not slow down traffic, research shows it actually speeds traffic up in many cases.\nThis is a regressive policy, and goes against the provincial government's stated policy of leaving municipal decision making to the municipalities. It reduces the autonomy of individual towns and cities, and stops local governments from being able to make progressive decisions on behalf of their constituents. More red tape is not what we need right now.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes help cities reduce car traffic congestion by taking them off the road when people switch to bikes due to the new bike lanes that are safe and efficient. A bonus is that if they are wide enough, emergency vehicles can use them to bypass the car traffic. People on bikes can easily dismount and step to the side, cars cannot, they are huge metal boxes that cannot move easily in tight spaces like cities. Stop this ridiculous bill from passing, this is only harming our people. Every civilized city has realised you can't fit millions of cars in a city, you need bikes. In these cities driving is also great, because there's no traffic. So stop trying to block infrastructure being built and start to encourage it.\n"

All the big roads are being converted to cycle lanes, instead of putting money in snow removal city is wasting money on cycle lanes. And we hardly see bicyclists using these lanes. Also people usually do not use bicycles in winters. So these lanes are of no use in winter. And it causes traffic congestion especially during school and office times. Happy that govt of Ontario stood up for our rights.\n"

If you do not we can only assume it is something Mr Ford and company are making up. Show us the data.  If it isn\u2019t a data driven decision it is a decision based on what?  Conclusion is it is based on listening to people in cars and disregarding emergency services and businesses on Bloor and people on bikes\u2014and those people matter too\n"

        "comment": "This is a move in the wrong direction for Ontario. We need more, not fewer, urban bike lanes. Studies show (https://www.cbc.ca/news/science/bike-lanes-impacts-1.7358319) that adding more lanes for vehicle traffic will only induce more people to use their vehicles. Moreover, as noted by the CBC (https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/doug-ford-toronto-bike-lanes-1.7\u2026) the Premier has exaggerated the impact of bike lanes.\nFurthermore, he is going to induce increased anger towards cyclists. I live in an area where a noticeable portion of the vehicle drivers do not share the road safely with cyclists. Mr. Ford is making the impression that cycling is a cause of gridlock when the cause of gridlock is too many cars and trucks on the roads, and adding more lanes is going to allow more cars and trucks, and make the roads more unsafe for cycling. Other than superhighways, the highway traffic act is clear about cyclists being allowed to use the roads. Reducing bike lanes in urban settings is going to possibly cause more cyclists to take refuge from increased car and truck traffic by riding on sidewalks.\nI feel this is a very badly misguided bill and that the provincial government is planning for a gross misuse of provincial resources (i.e. tax-payer money) in preventing and even removing bike lanes.\nIn addition, adding more lanes for traffic is going to increase the impact of car and truck exhaust on the increasingly damaged environment.\nHaving lived in large urban centres (Montreal, GTA, and Calgary) in my more than 50 years, I know that the more road space for cars and trucks, the more cars and trucks there are on the road.\nMr. Ford and his government would do well to instead increase bike lanes, fund more bike shares, increase public transit, and even use the funding that would remove bike lanes to subsidize public transit use either through reduced fares or income tax rebates. The plan, as it stands, is grossly misguided and damaging to the overall wellbeing of Ontario.\nI ask Mr. Ford to remember that Ontario is more than the Greater Toronto Area and this bill, that he is so adamantly pushing for, can do harm to other cities in the province. I also ask him to make sure that his MPPs get on message. My local MPP told me, via an assistant, in writing, that this bill was not being tabled and that my concerns were completely misguided. Three days after that statement from the MPP's office, Bill 212 was tabled.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes is ignoring the needs of a large share of your constituents and shows a clear misunderstanding of the problem you're trying to solve. If traffic is to be reduced, we need less reliance on cars and car infrastructure as they tend to cost more than public transit and bike infrastructure and take up more space.\nThe provinces reliance on car based solution shows either incompetence or a conflict of interest when making such decisions. Any research on this shows how short sighted a bill this is.\n"

Cities should be able to make their own choices.\nThe science shows that the best way to reduce car pile-up and speed up traffic is to have better drivers and less cars over all. Best way to achieve that is to make the exams harder, right now its too easy and we have too many incompetent drivers on the road, infrastructure for alternatives like light rails or bike paths that avoid traffic, and more railroads that connect different cities.\nA trip up north or down south would be amazing if there were ways to get there was a better public transportation infrastructure.\n"

It is a sad attempt at trying to secure votes from suburban commuters. There is substantial data that indicates that bike lanes make streets safer for everyone on the road. The goal is make alternative forms of travel safe and reliable, not prioritize cars. To table a bill that would rip up and remove existing bike lanes is one of the saddest and pathetic ideas I\u2019ve heard in a very long time and embarrassing for the province.\n"

We need more options to rely less on fossil fuels.\nThis ban also leaves out people of low socioeconomic status who rely on bikes to commute. We should not be punishing Ontarians for wanting equal access to roads for commuting.\nFurthermore, the highway 413 development should not be included in this ban. This is a separate issue, and it seems disingenuous that it is included in conversations around municipal bike lanes.\n"

So for each comment like mine, I'm sure there will be 10 times more from cyclists but don't fall for it.\n"
