        "comment": "\"A provision prohibits registered owners form applying under the expopriations act for the adjustment of the date of possession for land that was expropriated by the Ministor for the purposes of priority highway project.\"\nThis bill is a complete government overreach (hidden behind bike lane agenda). Bill 212 has been \"branded\" as the act that will remove bike lanes from a few streets in Toronto, this is not the main part of the act though, just the part they told us about. If you read the full act you can see there is a clause that allows the province to take your land for any highway that they want to build, without the ability to fight it throught the Expropriation Act.\nThis could be true for ANY highway. Do you live on the Gardiner, QEW, 401, 427, or any other 400 series highway, you could be at MASSIVE risk. This is a major legal overstep for the province, and we need to fight it. The public hearing seems to focus just on the bike line part of the act, and doesn't tell the full story.\nI would stringly oppose against this bill as it is anti-democratic and promotes government overreach.\n"

        "comment": "I am a resident of Ontario, a cyclist, and I also own a car. I am writing to state my opposition to the Ontario government\u2019s Bill 212 - Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024. This Bill is unsupported by evidence and ignores data-supported advice from planning experts, environmental advocates, and cycling groups. Bill 212 - Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024 will in fact make gridlock worse, will make our streets more dangerous for cyclists and pedestrians and more stressful for drivers, and will greatly harm the environment. According to the Ontario Professional Planners Institute (OPPI), in their Statement on Bike Lanes from a Planning Perspective: \u201cAs registered professional planners, OPPI members work to support a variety of mobility options in planning communities. Bike lanes provide people with options, improve public health and safety, support economic activity, foster social interaction and community connectivity, improve air quality and mitigate climate change impacts. The proposed legislative changes will not reduce congestion, will increase risk to public safety, and move away from evidence-based practices. It is also counter to the 2024 Provincial Planning Statement, which includes several policies that support the use of bike lanes.\u201d Abundant research shows that expanding bike lanes and investing in sustainable infrastructure including a robust public transit system is a much more effective\u2014and equitable\u2014solution to reducing gridlock, improving public health, and cutting emissions. I do NOT want my tax dollars to be spent on destroying bike lanes that already exist, and I do NOT support legislation that will make it more difficult for municipalities to add new bike lanes in the future.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are not going to increase traffic. We need to design for the future of what we want, and in general better cities. It is not a matter of bikes vs cars, but rather what kind of design will better human flourishing. And the answer to that is shifting away from vehicles that may cause accidents and pollute the environment, to an alternative that takes up less space, like bikes. In the long run this will cause less congestion and gridlock, contribute to cleaner air for our children, and a better city for all. If you take away bike lanes that may temporarily reduce grid lock, but induced demand is going to bring even more cars on the road and then we'll just run into the same problem again. The solution is not less bike lanes but more, so that we can help people make the switch to bikes so that we have better communities.\n"

        "comment": "Hi there.\nThe decision to remove bike lanes on major roads in Toronto is ill-considered and not based on any hard data or facts. It appears to be based on anecdotal comments and gut feel. It is also nakedly political and not in any way in the best interests of the residents of Toronto. If bike lanes are removed, more cyclists will die. Traffic will not be improved. Where is the study that says traffic will improve? Businesses will not benefit. Where is the study that says businesses will benefit? Cyclists will die. That fact HAS been studied and is a proven fact. And fewer people will cycle in the city. At a time when we are all trying to lower our collective carbon footprint.\nThe proposed legislation makes no sense, except to that small constituency of Ford voters who don't cycle and to whom the premier is clearly trying to chuck red meat.\nThis legislation should not pass.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my concerns regarding the proposed infrastructure bill, which includes provisions for expanding highways and creating additional lanes in Ontario. While I understand the intention behind these measures is to alleviate congestion, I believe that such approaches are fundamentally flawed and will not provide the long-term solutions we need.\n1. Ineffectiveness of Highway Expansion:\nHistory has shown that simply adding more highways and lanes does not effectively reduce traffic congestion in the medium to long term. Instead, it often leads to induced demand, where the increased capacity encourages more vehicles on the road, ultimately resulting in the same or even worse congestion levels. To truly address the issues of vehicle congestion, Ontario must prioritize investment in public transportation systems that offer reliable, efficient, and accessible alternatives to driving.\n2. Importance of Cycling Infrastructure:\nThe inclusion of cycle lanes in urban areas like Toronto is crucial for enhancing public safety and promoting healthier lifestyles. Expanding cycling infrastructure not only protects cyclists but also encourages more residents to choose biking as a viable mode of transportation. This shift can lead to reduced vehicle traffic, lower emissions, and improved public health outcomes related to fitness. Instead, the City should prohibit street parking on major streets to free above lanes. Further, there should be congestion charges to enter Toronto which would again reduce congestion and generate revenue for the city/Province to build better public infrastructure. The City of London (UK) is a great example of this. Building cities around cars is setting us back, limiting mobility in urban areas and increasing pollution.\n3. Concerns Over Property Rights:\nThe amendments proposed under the Building Broadband Faster Act raise significant concerns regarding property rights. The ability to expropriate land for broadband projects without adequate safeguards undermines the rights of property owners and could lead to unjust outcomes. It is essential that any infrastructure development respects and protects the rights of individuals and communities.\n4. Environmental Protections:\nI am particularly troubled by the proposed exemptions from the Environmental Assessment Act included in the Highways Act. Protecting our natural environment and biodiversity must be a priority in any infrastructure development. We cannot afford to prioritize concrete over the preservation of our ecosystems. Comprehensive environmental assessments are vital to ensure that we understand the potential impacts of our actions on the environment and take necessary steps to mitigate them.\nIn conclusion, I urge you to reconsider the direction of this bill. Instead of focusing on expanding highways, we should invest in sustainable public transportation solutions and prioritize the safety and health of our communities. This is where every major city in the world is heading. Building cities around cars is setting us back, limiting mobility in urban areas and increasing pollution. Additionally, we must uphold property rights and environmental protections to ensure a balanced approach to infrastructure development in Ontario.\nThank you for considering my perspective on this important issue.\n"

        "comment": "The Ontario government's proposal to remove bike lanes on iconic Toronto streets like Bloor, Yonge, and University Avenue is an alarming attack on the future of sustainable, people-centered transportation. This bill prioritizes cars over cyclists, undermining years of progress towards safer, greener cities. Removing bike lanes not only endangers cyclists but also reverses the much-needed shift towards reducing traffic congestion, lowering carbon emissions, and creating healthier, more vibrant communities. Instead of rolling back the clock, Ontario should be expanding and investing in infrastructure that supports clean, active transportation for everyone. This bill is a direct hit to our environment, our health, and our future\u2014it must be stopped.\n"

Bikes don't cause traffic congestion: cars and trucks do! (Seems so silly to even have to say it.)

To spend an absurd amount of money removing on a project that took years to complete is an inane objective.

The government will either have to spend a lot of time and money to understand the bike lane proposal that municipalities bring forward OR they will have some basic guidelines that will block bike lanes despite what a local community wants/needs. Additionally, lots of tax payer money will be wasted removing lanes that the cities have just installed.\nIt also has some provisions that I find very dangerous regarding property close to major highways that the province can take in order to expand highways which will only lead to abuse by this government and future government.\nThis is a incredibly short sighted bill that will only make gridlock worse.

It is a lose-lose situation for everyone except for the contractors who will be paid to remove this valuable infrastructure.

        "comment": "This bill is a clear overstep of the provincial government impeding on the responsibility of the municipalities in Ontario. Transit within cities are primarily managed by and meant for the people who reside within those cities. These local bike routes and forms of transportation should only be managed by the municipality themselves. The provincial government can provide funding for these projects, just as the federal government provides funding to the provinces for certain issues, but the municipalities are the ones who know what is needed within their city or not. The provincial can focus on larger forms of transportation, such as connecting cities to each other using busses, trains, etc. but bike lanes are not an issue they should be spending any time with as the MPPs do not know enough about each individual city to determine their needs in this regard.\nSecondly the idea to remove the Toronto bike lanes as proposed in the bill is an unneeded and harmful decision. That not only wastes taxpayers money, it also will not reduce gridlock in the slightest. Over 8% of daily commutes use these lanes already and they are still very new, that number is expected to rise significantly. Encourage people to use bikes is not only helpful towards the environment, it also increases the public\u2019s own wellbeing as exercise is extremely important and something many people should be encouraged to do. The Ford government has also said that emergency vehicles would have a hard time with these lanes, albeit they didn\u2019t provide any actual proof of first responders saying these things, but these lanes are full width, separated lanes that first responders can also drive on. It is far easier to ask a bunch of cyclists to move out of the way for an emergency than it is to get a bunch of cars to move especially during times of heavy traffic.\nI am fully opposed to this bill. It is a waste of tax payer money to remove brand new bike lanes that are being used. It also does more harm than good in relation to traffic, the health of the public and the environment. Along with this the lines between provincial and municipal issues become blurred as the Ford government is trying to abuse their power and take control of an issue that is not suppose to be a provincial government issue.\n"

I always drive defensively, assuming I am invisible to car drivers and never assuming they will follow the law because my life is on the line. With separated bike lanes, finally, I can (mostly) just RIDE. I wonder at times when will I also be able to BREATHE without gulping lungfulls of exhaust from the mostly single drivers, idling as the bikes flow past them? Why should the luxury of sitting in a vastly polluting car be more important than my healthy choice \u2014 for planet, city and self? How dare you threaten us with unscientific, spiteful, culture-war rhetoric of this bill \u2014 removing bike lanes is a waste of public resources, will fuel MORE gridlock and put cyclists lives again in direct jeopardy.
