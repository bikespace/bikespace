        "comment": "SCHEDULE 3 HIGHWAY 413 ACT, 2024\nSection 2 of the above schedule to the proposed legislation making the Highway 413 project exempt from the Environmental Assessment Act is a short-sighted and dangerous inclusion.\nThe purpose of the Environmental Assessment Act  \"is the betterment of the people of the whole or any part of Ontario by providing for the protection, conservation and wise management in Ontario of the environment\".\nTo undercut the Environmental Assessment Act is to disregard any potential negative impacts caused by but not limited to the Highway 413 project.\nIf these projects are to truly benefit the people of Ontario they should be implemented carefully so as not to cause harm. Consideration should also be taken as to what parties may benefit from sidestepping the Environmental Assessment Act and what parties may be negatively impacted. The interests of the people of Ontario should be placed above any private interests.\n"

        "comment": "No to Bill 212. Here's why:\n1. Economic Impact on Small Businesses: The lack of investment for cycling infrastructure as part of Bill 212 is short-sighted and undermines Ontario\u2019s commitment to supporting small businesses. Encouraging more cycling would boost local businesses, as cyclists tend to shop locally and more frequently. Neglecting this investment means lost opportunities for growth and a missed chance to strengthen local economies.\n2. Increased Strain on Existing Infrastructure: By discouraging the expansion of bike lanes through Bill 212, we are effectively placing more strain on an already overburdened transportation network. Fewer bike lanes mean more cars, more traffic congestion, and longer commute times, exacerbating the very gridlock the bill claims to address. Investing in comprehensive cycling infrastructure would relieve pressure on roadways and public transportation systems.\n3. Disregard for the Climate Crisis: Bill 212's neglect of proper cycling infrastructure is a blatant disregard for Ontario\u2019s role in addressing the climate crisis. Promoting car-centric transportation policies directly conflicts with the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Expanding bike lanes would offer a sustainable, low-emission alternative that aligns with our climate goals and improves the quality of life for all Ontarians.\n"

        "comment": "As a car-free resident of Ottawa, I am concerned that the proposal\u2019s goal to \u201cget drivers where they need to go faster\u201d is incredibly short-sighted and directly opposes the needs of Ontarians. It ignores the complexity of transit, our communities\u2019 roles beyond transit, our municipal governments\u2019 role in implementing a future that residents want, the critical goals of reducing and mitigating climate change, and ensuring communities are liveable. It also establishes a \u201ccar vs. non-car\u201d mentality that is dangerous, inaccurate, and irresponsible.\nIf we do need a change in how the province intervenes in municipal transit, it needs to be about getting people where they need to go faster, safer, and in a way that supports our communities\u2019 other functions. Achieving this goal includes pedestrianizing streets to help Ontarians and visitors explore local businesses without the dangers and barriers to access caused by cars, an investment in useful public transit, remote-friendly and flexible workplaces that reduce highly preventable commuter traffic, 15-minute cities where amenities are accessible without reliance on a car, more complete bike networks, and better pedestrian pathways that are enjoyable to use. It also may include more lanes of car traffic and adjustments to transit priority where evidence indicates, but this should be a last resort. In 2024 when we\u2019re dealing with a housing, liveability, healthcare, education, and climate crisis, the provincial government\u2019s proposal is completely at odds with all best practices, examples from other cities, and the wishes of Ontarians.\n"
