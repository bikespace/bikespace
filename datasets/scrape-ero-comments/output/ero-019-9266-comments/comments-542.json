        "comment": "I appreciate having the opportunity to let my voice be heard. Thank you\nI am opposed to this. For the same reason, these bike lanes are wanted to be taken away, this is more reason to keep them. The traffic is only so bad on these roads because of vehicles, not bikes. I want that to be clear. Biking should not be punished because a large one-person SUV is holding up traffic. Driving in any major city is a mistake globally and adding a few meters of space will not change that. More vehicles on the road means more traffic and more risk of accidents/delays.\nBike lanes mean more people biking and frankly fewer cars on the road. If more people biked, there would be less cars on the road, which actually clears up traffic. Furthermore, bikers would just go back to driving, meaning more traffic, or even worse continue to bike on these roads, and that has lead to fatalities in the past.\nI understand the problem but this solution feels rather naive and does not capture all the context around it. More cars means more traffic. Traffic has never been solved by adding more cars. So much of taxpayers money would go to waste undoing what's been done that does not even solve the issue. I'd much rather that money go to alternative ways of transportation, which would actually reduce traffic. We need solutions that keep cars in driveways and parking lots.\n"

        "comment": "Re:\u00a0City of Toronto Agenda Item2024.MM23.14 - Provincial Overreach and Toronto\u2019s Infrastructure - by Councillor Dianne Saxe, seconded by Councillor Amber Morley\nWe, the residents of the Summerhill area, specifically those of us living EAST of YONGE ST absolutely\u00a0DEMAND that these dangerous and disastrous bike lanes be removed. EMS response times to our neighbourhood, where Yonge St is the ONLY WAY IN OR OUT, have been impacted DRAMATICALLY.\nYet, according to official EMS data, there has been no impact on response times.\u00a0NONSENSE. These concerns have been raised by many others as well, including in a December 20, 2023 Toronto Sun article entitled \u201cBike lanes drastically impair ambulances in heavy traffic.\u201d The Toronto paramedics union was the primary source for the article. They recognize the danger these bike lanes have created, why doesn\u2019t Toronto city council?\nToronto city council does not fully appreciate the danger here: There is NO ANALOG worldwide for what the city has done. I could not find a single example anywhere, where a municipality has choked off a major artery and effectively \u201cwalled in\u201d 5,000 to 6,000 residents whose only access is via that main thoroughfare, in order to install bicycle lanes. I think if it were them or their loved one that needed an ambulance, they\u2019d have a different opinion of this situation.\nThe very fact that\u00a0Dianne Saxe is advocating in favour of them tells us all we need to know - She does not care in the slightest about her constituents in the immediate area of this DISASTER.\u00a0\nThe VAST MAJORITY of local residents (i.e. those\u00a0who have to live with your bad decisions) have LOATHED these bike lanes since the minute they were forced down our throats. They have created a traffic NIGHTMARE.\nCouncillor Bradford has said: \u201cWe need to have the humility at city hall to recognize when they\u2019re [bike lanes] not working.\u201d That\u2019s right, HUMILITY.\nNot all bike lanes are created equal and the Yonge St ones have dramatically impacted our quality of life and safety. THEY ARE A DISASTER WAITING TO HAPPEN.\nREMOVE THEM IMMEDIATELY.\nJ. A., Toronto.\n"

        "comment": "Having Bike lanes on so called Secondary roads vs primary roads does not solve the purpose.  Secondary roads are usually roads where the speed limit is less than 50 km/h so bike lanes are not necessarily needed. Also Secondary roads are usually roads where there is housing, so cyclists are not using these roads as they donot have commerce on these streets.  Also secondary roads are usually not direct routes, and just like cars,  so unless they live there on the secondary roads will not be using these roads.  Bike lanes are needed on busy streets and primary roads to keep active transportation users save from cars, trucks, motorbikes and other heavy vehicles.\n"

Torontonians need more transportation options, not fewer. Many Toronto residents don\u2019t own cars and rely on biking as an affordable, reliable way to navigate the city. I believe we should focus on making bike lanes safer, not removing them. This is regressive and lazy policymaking and we deserve better.\n"

        "comment": "I don't support this framework within Bill 212.\nAs a bike rider myself, the decrease in bike lanes will make it more difficult and dangerous for me to share the road with motor vehicles. Furthermore, pedestrian walkways alongside roads are often not wide enough for both pedestrians and bike riders to share, making it more imperative to have dedicated bike lanes in roads.\nI personally know several people that are avid bike riders within Toronto and the wider GTA, and they are also opposed to this framework because of the safety risks it poses to them, as well as the diminished quality of life they will experience as a result. Not to mention, increasing the number of motor vehicles on roads will be worse for the environment and the overall quality of people's lives.\nIn my opinion, this is a backwards, redundant policy that seeks to place blame on bike lanes and bike riders as the driving cause for traffic gridlock and congestion issues across Ontario. There are more viable, concrete solutions to solve traffic congestion across the province than eliminating bike lanes.\nTo conclude, I don\u2019t support this framework and it should not be passed.\n"

        "comment": "I am a at various times a driver, a pedestrian, and a cyclist living and working in Toronto. Cycling in Toronto can be terrifying and I have spent years reluctant to use cycling as a way to commute out of fears for my life. The bike lanes on University Avenue and Bloor St in particular have made me feel safer whether commuting as a pedestrian, as a driver, or as a cyclist. Eliminating bike lanes does not eliminate bike traffic on those streets, just makes it less safe for everyone. Since the bike lanes on Bloor, drivers have fewer opportunities to speed and drive erratically and it feels safer for all involved. I have also begun using my bicycle to commute with regularity. The evidence bears this out and demonstrates that cycling infrastructure helps to convert vehicular traffic to cycling traffic which ultimately will make the city easier for all to get around. The answer to the GTA gridlock problem is NOT to eliminate bike lanes. I strongly oppose Bill 212.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to request the reconsideration of Bill 212. My concerns relate to the provincial oversight and restrictions on the installation of cycling infrastructure (i.e., bike lanes). There are five areas of benefit that bike lanes provide: (1) improved safety for all road users (including decreased dooring collisions, sideswipe, and rear end collisions) , (2) increased economic outcomes for local businesses and governments, (3) reduced greenhouse gas emissions, (4) decreased access gap for equity-seeking populations, and (5) improved physical and mental health.  I will now focus on the health, equity, and safety implications of providing protected bike lanes.\nFirst, physical activity is a key factor in reducing numerous chronic health conditions and improving individuals\u2019 mental wellbeing. Physical activity, such as through active transportation \u2013 walking, cycling, or other active modes of travel \u2013 is an effective way to meet the 24-hour movement guidelines that show increases to health, well-being, and fitness. Specifically, bike lanes can increase the total distance traveled by cyclists and the overall ridership of residents.  By replacing some car trips with cycling, research indicates that people can gain an additional nine life-years.  Moreover, by not incorporating physical activity into Canadians\u2019 lifestyles, the healthcare system is estimated to spend $6.8 billion per year due to the impact physical inactivity has on chronic diseases.\nSecond, prioritizing private vehicle use disproportionately impacts equity-deserving populations such as racialized persons, people living on low incomes, persons with disabilities, women, and Indigenous peoples. For example, lower income neighbourhoods have historically been poorly designed with increased safety and health risks. However, when active transportation is included into the neighbourhood design (i.e., sidewalks, bike lanes, public transit, roadways) social and health inequities are reduced.6 Given transportation options, individuals can select the affordable and safe travel mode to participate in the workforce, access grocery stores, recreational facilities, and healthcare services.  This research is not unique as researchers and governments globally have identified that high-quality multi-modal infrastructure increases the use of active transportation, and its\u2019 associated social and health benefits. Additionally, when individuals have affordable transportation options, they have more money to spend on necessities such as food and rent, or extras such as goods from local business.\nThird, safety of all roadway users increases with the installation of bike lanes. As outlined by the Canadian Paediatric Society, cycling infrastructure that is well-connected (\u2018cycle tracks\u2019) has a halo effect where collisions involving motorists, pedestrians, and cyclists decreased in a 500m surrounding area. Additionally, protected bike lanes are the safest option for all roadway users compared to painted lines, protected right of ways, and elevated lanes.\nHigh-quality active transportation infrastructure leads to more people walking and cycling. Active travel has many proven physical and mental health benefits and impacts chronic disease prevalence. These investments need to be distributed equitably so that every community member can enjoy the benefits of active transportation.\nReferences:\n  Ministry of Transportation Ontario. (2022).
