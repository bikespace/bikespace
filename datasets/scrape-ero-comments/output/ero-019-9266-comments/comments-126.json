        "comment": "I strongly disagree with the proposal to eliminate bike lanes where they prevent the creation of additional lanes for motorists.  Even with the bike lanes we have, hundreds of bicycle-car/truck collisions, injuries and death occur every year.  Removing bike lanes will make the situation worse.  In addition, cyclists will likely (and understandably) use pedestrian paths, creating collision dangers with pedestrians. As you know, promoting walking and biking are important to improve people's health and reduce pollution.  Prioritizing cars will only increase traffic congestion and worsen people's health.  So stop micro-managing, and WITHDRAW this proposal, or at least leave it to each Ontario municipality's control as to what works best for them.\n"

If you want to have tangible improvement of traffic on main roads, increase penalties/enforcement for cars that are parked illegally.\n"

I do not use public transportation or cycle on roadways.\nLike many in my position, I have a love/hate relationship with cyclists (including E-scooters) on the road mostly due to what I feel is reckless behaviour on their part in relation to safety on our roads in the city.\nI am saying this to say that I am not in favour of removing bike lanes off our roads. Since these bike lanes have been installed my encounters with cyclists with careless conduct on the streets have decreased exponentially. My worry that I will seriously injure one of the unsafe riders has significantly decreased as well.\nAlso, I feel that removing these bike lanes is frankly a waste of money.\nI am asking that you please reconsider your stance on removing bike lanes from these downtown areas of Toronto.\nThank you for your consideration.\n"

        "comment": "I empathize with drivers that are frustrated but taking away the cities autonomy to build bike lanes where they are needed is not the solution. Change is hard but the reality is that as our city grows, we need new strategies. Helping people feel safe biking to encourage commuting that way is a great one.  I have lived in Toronto for 8 years and the addition of new bike lanes has drastically changed how I get around.  Much of ontario, including Toronto is the perfect environment for biking. It\u2019s flat and not too hot or cold (especially with global warming). The provincial government should focus on finishing the construction of the new train lines and let municipalities do there thing with bike lanes.  A train + bike commute is a much better one than driving in traffic with regards to the environment and people\u2019s happiness and health.\n"

        "comment": "I am firmly and entirely against the proposed Act, both in terms of its specific contents and its general intent. The notion that bicycle lanes cause and/or significantly exacerbate vehicular traffic is frankly ludicrous, and is not supported by research. Allocating space in the right-of-way for cyclists to travel safely is good policy - this is vital infrastructure for a safe, healthy, and environmentally friendly mode of active transportation.\nPromoting street design that prioritizes cars over all other forms of mobility will generate more traffic. Given the growing populations of Ontario's urban centres, the only way to reduce vehicle traffic is to invest in viable transportation alternatives to cars, such as cycling. In addition to the efficiency of cycling, it provides physical health benefits ,and is a carbon-free method of transportation. Cycling infrastructure requires significantly less paved area in comparison to vehicle lanes, has a lower maintenance cost, saving taxpayers money. Investing in bicycle lanes pays off in all regards.\nIf enacted, Bill 212 would be detrimental across the board. I urge the government to abandon this ill-conceived plan to cause greater car dependency across Ontario.\nThank you for your consideration of my comment.\n"

        "comment": "This is a ridiculous, backward piece of legislation. The *only* way to reduce congestion is to remove cars; this has been proven time and time again. You say you are data-driven, but this is laughable. Safe bike lanes give people clean, green and healthy opportunities to get out of their cars. Of course not all car trips can be replaced by bikes, but many can. This creates space for those who cannot use a bicycle to get around. It relieves gridlock for transit as well, which you should be investing in before more roads for private cars. It has been proven in Toronto and many other places that cyclists bring more business to the areas where bike lanes are located. Again - if you are data driven you should know this. When bicycle lanes are separated from car lanes it is safer for both. Interfering with local governments and their transportation plans is out of scope for your ministry.\nGiven all this, your proposed legislation is anti-health, anti-environment, anti-safety, pro-gridlock, anti-business, anti-small-government....\nGet stuffed. This is one of the stupidest things you've proposed, and that's saying a lot.\n"

        "comment": "Better/safer bike infrastructure = more bikes and less people driving. The only way you are going to combat traffic is by making biking more accessible and promoting transit. Why are we trying to go backwards and look for an easy fix. Especially for where I am Toronto. You can basically bike year round now. Aren't we trying to reduce emissions, not promote people driving and creating more? I honestly do not understand this logic. Please stop your destruction of Toronto. I used to love this city and province. It's truly sad what is happening here. You have not kept up with the infrastructure and now you are punishing the cyclists. I use these bike lanes along with friends to go to parks, to go to local businesses and to commute to work. Many I know who do not bike as much, would do so more if there was a cohesive and safe network. Something this act will make much harder to do. Your logic for proposing this is baseless and flawed. I believe not having a cohesive network of bike lanes that are safe contributes more to traffic. We will take routes without bike lanes because it is easier than the convoluted/ non network we currently have. This creates a headache for all. Drivers are mad at bikes, Bikes are mad at cars. Why not promote biking instead of waging a war on it. And especially stay out of Toronto's business. Too much government over reach. Lastly. I have also sustained a serious injury from biking in Toronto in a park of town that has zero bike lanes. Which contributed to our resources being used to help me when a protected lane could have helped. I have had a friend killed by biking and being hit by a car as well. I don't know why the province is so keen on stopping SAFE infrastructure so some cars can save a few seconds. Do your job and finish transit projects and help encourage bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "I am a resident of downtown Toronto living in the west end, very near the Bloor bike lane. I use every mode of transport: I take public transit, walk, bike, and drive to get around, depending on my needs. Out of these modes, I use public transit and my bicycle the most frequently to get to work.\nI find the premier's attacks on bike lanes and this new proposed legislation to be appalling: both are ludicrously shortsighted, an attempt to usurp municipal powers to design roads with the safety of all users in mind, and an attack on my personal safety as a resident of Toronto.\nI frequently use the Bloor bike lane that the mayor has been threatening to rip up. The bike lane has not only improved my quality of life significantly; it has also made my daily commute to work much safer, whether I am commuting by bike, on foot, or by public transport, because it calms all of the traffic along Bloor.\nThe thought of ripping up the Bloor bike lane when sections of it were completed only weeks ago is, frankly, heartbreaking. Residents in this area have been waiting to see roadwork around the ROM completed for years, not to mention around the rail overpasses near the Dundas West station. Why would the province waste millions of dollars to rip out bike lanes that were just installed this summer??\nWhile Bloor is a main thoroughfare in this city, its above-ground function is not to shuttle as many cars as possible from one end to the other. Rather, it is lined with shops, small businesses, and tourist sites, and as such is more of a destination where people stop and spend time. As such, having one lane of traffic in each direction, plus bike lanes and wide sidewalks, serves the community best. It allows people to easily navigate to all the places they want to visit along Bloor.\nThe vast majority of people who need to transit along a large section of Bloor do so not above ground but underground, in the Line 2 subway. The presence of the subway underground allows the design of Bloor aboveground to be calm, with a minimum of traffic. If drivers wish to transit the city faster, they can use other streets with more lanes, such as Dupont. Or, even better, they can ditch their car and take transit!\nAt a time when we are feeling the effects of climate change more and more by the day, it is alarming to see our government so utterly fail to serve its citizens by trying to encourage more people, rather than fewer, to drive gas-guzzling vehicles. This is precisely the opposite of what we should be doing. We need more people to choose climate-friendly alternatives, such as biking, walking, and public transit. They will do so if the province works with the city to create safe streets that serve all road users\u2014not only drivers.\n"
