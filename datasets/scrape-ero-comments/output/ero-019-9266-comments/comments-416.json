        "comment": "Are you out of your mind? How does a bike lane cause traffic when it lets people ride a bike instead of driving a car around. The space requirements are entirely different. The traffic congestion caused from removing those lanes alone would be more than they ever caused. Have you ever listened to an expert in your life? If you really want to decrease traffic, and this isn't just some culture war conservative fight against climate change initiatives, give more funding to the TTC so less people are forced to drive to places.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes should not be removed for the benefit of car commuters to solve \"gridlock\" when the vast majority of car traffic happens due to the sheer space each car takes up and the amount of people who choose to commute by car. Adding a lane will never fix the problem of induced and latent demand of major arterial roads, and the only way to solve traffic is to actively provide viable commute alternatives to cars which take up a significantly less amount of space per commuter. Doug Ford's plan is a display of total disrespect against those who don't use the same mode of transportation as him, and is a showing of the \"suburbanite\" car-centric mindset. Sure, people who drive cars are trying to get to places, but so are cyclists, who are also people. Driving a car does not grant one superiority over others who take other modes of transport , and one group absolutely should not be able to make another's commute less safe and convenient to benefit their own.\nTo respond to arguements such as \" I never see bike lanes being used\", there are two things to consider. Firstly, car-centric commute has long been massively funded by the government, hence the conveniency of driving with a car, but most of the time, costs of road repair, expansions, come out of every tax payer, including those who do not drive. In contrast, bike commute network are much less developed due to chronic underfunding and politics caused by people who believe \"bike lanes are taking away their road space\" when in reality, less people in cars and more people on bikes results in an overal decrease in car traffic. The sparse network of bike lanes lower the amount of commuters who can reliably choose to commute with a bike, highlighting the need for a more connected network instead of claims of their redundancy. Secondly, since bikes take up much less space than cars do, 100 cars passing through a road looks much less than 100 bikes passing through a road, which is also a reason why some may come to the conclusion that bike lanes are underused. However, the aforementioned reasons are invalid arguements and should be refuted in light of the evidence provided.\nAs mentioned above, more people on bikes means less cars on roads, which leads to an overall decrease in car traffic. De-incentivizing municipalities from installing new bike lanes and the straight up removal of them to prioritize motor traffic is not only unfair and unsafe to those who commute with bikes, but can also lead to an increase in car traffic as bike commuters now have to put their lives at risk when riding on roads (legal by the way) and take up space in car  laneways instead of having their own dedicated lanes. Previous deaths of cyclists and common sense will lead to the conclusion that cars are much more deadly to cyclists than cyclists are to cars. Therefore, through this proposed bill, it seems like the province is trying to increase car traffic and civilian deaths from traffic accidents related to bikes. This bill should be rejected without delay, and it is concerning that it was even considered for proposal.\n"

The removal of existing infrastructure will make the use of these alternatives more dangerous and less convenient, forcing me and many like me to use my car for all trips, adding to even more gridlock.\nAs a driver the largest source of congestion in my experience is parked cars and delivery vehicles, even during rush hour where stopping is prohibited.\nIf the province really wants to deal with gridlock it should reevaluate on street parking, be tougher on enforcement of parking/standing/stopping signage, and instead of wasting money changing already existing bike lanes should prioritize the opening of transit projects that are many years delayed.\nI feel here the provincial government is overstepping into municipal affairs instead of focusing on its neglected responsibilities such as healthcare and education.\n"

        "comment": "To remove the bike lanes is a huge waste of taxpayer money. I am a tax paying Canadian citizen. I take the subway everyday for work and school, and also own a car and drive when needed. Despite this, I fully support the ongoing and continuing development and expansion of bike lanes. When I am driving, I want the cyclists to be protected from drivers. It's better for me as a driver. I care about the general safety and well-being of my fellow Torontonians. The congestion we experience in this city is because we don't have enough alternatives to driving. To remove bike lines would just make it worse, especially in the long run. (Referencing bike lane volume from the census during the pandemic is incredibly short-sighted and unrealistic.) I want to live in a city where the planning and building of public works has the future in mind, not lazy, loose Band-Aid solutions that cater only to reactionary fears of the present. I want Toronto to be city full of travelling choices for everyone.\n"

They provide a more equitable way for people to get around without taking up the space and cost of cars. They also reduce congestion by reducing trips people take by car. Healthier, safer, and better for the environment. Removing bike lanes that already exist is an incredible waste of money and will result in deaths of cyclists and increased chance of death of pedestrians. By passing this bill you are directly responsible for the death of cyclists and pedestrians, the general worsening of the province.\n"

There would be more cyclists using bicycle infrastructure if it were available. I personally would use it if it was available, but there is little in Scarborough where I am based. Removing core routes of the bicycle network that are already scarce will drive people towards driving which will directly add to more traffic and gridlock in the city.\n"

The cost of entry to personal mobility of a bike is factors lower than the car.

You say that the cycling infrastructure is under utilized that\u2019s because it is not done yet finish it interconnectivity then see the lanes be used!

        "comment": "I would like to comment that the provincial government should not be removing bike lanes that city governments have installed.\nMy family all uses bicycles as a form of transportation and always seek out bike lanes as a safer route to our destination.  My two children specifically use bike lanes as often as they can. For example, my high school aged son uses the bike lanes on Bloor Street West to cycle from his home to his high school. This has been a huge benefit to him as it allows him to get to high school in a safe manner. It has also given him a huge sense of freedom and independence as he can travel around the area in a safe way. He is visiting stores and spending money at local businesses along Bloor Street that he would not have visited if the bike lanes were not there.\nIf the bike lanes are removed it will be first and foremost less safe for him to get to an from school and we are not sure of the route that he would use.\nMaking cycling a priority in the city allows for active transportation, reduces pollutions, saves people money or allows people to get around who cannot afford a car or TTC. Bike lanes are a component of making cycling a priority and the city should be able to determine where it wants to put them to benefit its citizens in the areas where the lanes will be installed.\nThank you for reviewing this information.\n"

The bikes lanes Toronto have added in recent years are a good step in that direction.\nThe removal of the bike lanes is clearly political and not based on the evidence found in the several studies Toronto has done on bike lakes over the years.\nAdditionally this should be a municipal matter. It\u2019s another example of the Doug Ford government not taking care of provincial problems and distracting itself with Toronto specific issues.

        "comment": "The most effective way of reducing gridlock is to give people more choices for how to get around. Removing bike lanes does the opposite. Adding more car lanes may reduce travel times in the short term only. We don't need to encourage more people to drive, we need to increase access to other modes: walking, cycling and using transit. Bike lanes facilitate a clean, efficient and safe option that many are discovering every day. You just have to see the number of bike-shares being used to realize that.\n"
