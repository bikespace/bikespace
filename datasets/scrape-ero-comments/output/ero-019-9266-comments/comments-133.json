        "comment": "I agree with the Provincial Government's proposed plans regarding bike lanes. The bike lanes are adding the congestion to the streets. For the number of bikes using the streets it is not an effective money saving plan and they don't pay taxes as cars do through gas prices.\nThe bike lanes get shoveled in the winter whereas the sidewalks do not so pedestrians are using them as walkways. Additionally, a strip painted on the roads and narrowing the lanes are no safe. When looking to Europe's bike lanes, they are usually separated by a strip of land and sidewalk.\nPerhaps consider, when making new developments, to implement separate bike lanes with these strips as planned developments. Established cities are more difficult to deal with. Side-streets are safer and less used.\n"

        "comment": "Removing and / or restricting bike lanes in Toronto is a horrendous idea. There are countless research papers that prove that increasing lanes, increases traffic. 2 examples:\n- https://dot.ca.gov/-/media/dot-media/programs/research-innovation-syste\u2026\n- https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5c0e5848e5274a0bf3cbe124\u2026\nEven if you logically think through, each bike takes up ~1 square metre of space, each car takes up ~5 square metres of space. Bikeshare Toronto cited that in 2023 there were over 5.7 million bike trips, and that only accounts for rides using their bikes meaning the total number of bike trips is likely millions higher. If we took all those bike trips (say 7 million) it would take up 34,000,000 more square feet of roadways. If the argument for this is legitimately to reduce traffic, clearly 34M more square feet of vehicles on the road is not going to help traffic issues.\nThen, let's move on to the other benefits of biking:\n1) It's cheap. Someone can buy a bicycle for <$500. If they ride that bike to work every day, say 250 days of the year for 10 years the cost per ride is $0.20 per ride. An annual membership to the bikeshare program costs $100, which would be $0.25 per ride. This is drastically cheaper than public transportation. If we compare this to a vehicle, costing $40,000 (lower than the cost for an average new car today), assume it also lasts for 10 years, and is taken to work for 250 days a year, that costs $16 a day excluding any parking costs. We all know that the cost of living in Toronto is high. Forcing someone who bikes to work every day to instead use a car would make the city significantly less livable.\n2) It's healthy. While Doug Ford may not appreciate exercise, it's a well established fact that exercise is beneficial to health, longevity, happiness, etc. By removing bike lanes, you would be limiting the options for safe, cheap exercise within the city. Additional an increase in car traffic is also unhealthy. Not only does it lead to more sedentary lifestyles, it also pollutes. Pollution clearly is not healthy, so double whammy by removing the bike lanes!\nIf Doug Ford and his provincial government is going to get involved in Toronto's infrastructure and roads, they should instead be increasing the number of bike lanes. We all know this is a political ploy, but stop messing with Toronto's policies. This is a horrible proposal that will damage both Toronto's reputation on the global stage, while simultaneously making a mockery of Doug Ford's 'leadership'.\n"

        "comment": "The stated, abstract objective of this Act is to reduce \u201cgridlock,\u201d using means which are proven to be detrimental to public health and safety, mobility and access to Ontario communities for all people, environmental protection, and will aid in worsening the ongoing climate emergency.\nDespite having the authority to do so per the Municipal Act, requiring provincial approval for construction of new bike lanes where they \u201creplace a lane of traffic\u201d is a dramatic overreach of government authority in the affairs of municipalities. This is meddlesome and suggests the provincial government doesn\u2019t have faith or trust in municipalities to manage their own affairs, and further suggests that the provincial government isn\u2019t interested in local democracy\u2014bike lanes aren\u2019t constructed without warning; they are built only after an extensive planning process, which includes considerable research and community input.\nFurthermore, it is an objective fact that more car lanes will not reduce traffic congestion: the concept of Induced Demand indicates that with more car lanes, there is more traffic. This phenomenon has been observed all over the world. If this government were serious about \u201creducing gridlock,\u201d it would be making investments to the tune of several billion dollars to prioritize development and construction of extensive transit projects all over the province, and would invest considerable time, money and effort into the construction of more, comprehensive cycling networks. One more bike on the road is one less car; bikes take up far less space on the road than a single occupancy vehicle, thereby making more room for those who are or who must drive.\nIt is important to mention as well that the three bike lanes Premier Ford has pledged to remove in Toronto also see thousands of users per day\u2014that\u2019s literally thousands of cars that are off the road as a result. Local businesses are more successful in areas with bike lanes (this is easily proven looking at the Bloor Bike Lane reports prepared by City staff in Toronto), and various Toronto BIAs have already come out in support of bike lanes and the detrimental impact their removal would have on local businesses.\nCycling is also the far healthier option: physical activity leads to better health outcomes which leads to less money required for healthcare services.\nInstallation of bike lanes also have the added advantage of making the entire streetscape safer to use for all mobility modes; cars, bikes, pedestrians, and all others. Their existence can save the lives of cyclists and many others. Six cyclists have died on Toronto streets this year, and that is six too many; innocent lives lost because the victims were trying to get across town. Utterly senseless, with families shattered as a result.\nPertaining to bike lanes, my final comment is that the existence of these lanes gives all people greater access to their municipality. Those without the financial means to own a car, pay for insurance, parking, gas, etc. are more able to traverse their municipality for work, recreation, and to support the local economy. A car-centric community is a community that closes itself off to a considerable portion of its population.\nOn the topic of exempting 413 lands from environmental assessments, this is yet another short-sighted policy that will result in disastrous outcomes for the environment. The area where the highway is intended to be built is environmentally sensitive land. Once paved over, that land is lost as a carbon sink, a natural habitat for native flora and fauna, and as a floodplain/natural flood control measure\u2014forever. The proposal that this highway should be exempted from any environmental assessment to expedite development suggests the government doesn\u2019t care whatsoever about the environment and, again, is not serious about eliminating gridlock: as mentioned above, the concept of induced demand means that on completion, it will create more gridlock and spew more harmful greenhouses gas emissions into the atmosphere. Here, again, I must emphasize that if the government is serious about reducing gridlock, the only way forward is to invest in and build a massive public transit infrastructure, and augment municipal streets with alternative means of mobility, such as bike lanes.\nI question whether any planners, environmentalists, engineers or any other credentialed experts were consulted at all in the creation of this bill.\nIn summary, Bill 212 is a backwards approach to \u201creducing\u201d gridlock which will have the complete opposite effect of its stated objective: gridlock will become worse, public safety will be worse, local economies will suffer, the environment will be senselessly, irreparably destroyed, and health outcomes for Ontarians will be worse, which will end up costing us more. This bill should not move forward.\n"

        "comment": "For starters, why is the province even getting involved in these types of decisions. This is for municipalities to decide what's right for their communities, not take an edict from the premier. Secondly, reducing gridlock means getting more cars OFF roads and more options like better transit. Leaning into biking infrastructure and make that easier for people to use. Ensure transit is better in communities.\n"

        "comment": "Major urban cities around the world have already figured it out, so hopefully Ontario can too: pedestrian-friendly areas, accessible cycling infrastructure, and reliable public transit are how you build dense but thriving cities that allow people to get around -- not by having roads that primarily prioritize cars.\nThe GTA population is booming, and that's a great thing because it means it's an enviable place to live and work. But do you really think that removing bicycle tracks is going to fix the congestion problem? With fewer alternative ways to get around, these lanes will quickly get filled with more cars bringing things to a standstill. Take a look at some other key intersections/streets in Toronto: no bike lanes, and yet the traffic is endless. Bike lanes aren't the problem, although it seems that making them into one is a politically expedient solution for the government.\nTo meaningfully tackle our traffic problems we need a healthy mix of transportation options that encourages those who can to leave the car at home. Without convenient bike lanes, that doesn't happen. You get more people in cars, clogging things up.\nBesides tackling congestion, we all want safe roads. As a cyclist, every time I get on my bike shouldn't carry the risk of getting injured while I'm doing errands and commuting around the city. (Incidentally, where do you think the stores and businesses I visit are? On all those major streets that bike lanes help me get to.) And as a driver, I'd like not to be involved in a traumatizing accident where a cyclist or pedestrian is injured because of poor street design.\nLastly, stop overreaching. This is a municipal issue. Stay out of Toronto's politics and focus on the things that the Province is actually meant to be administrating.\n"

Not only do bike lanes protect cyclist but they also create an additional barrier to protect pedestrians.  Further these approaches are proven to not have merit and do not achieve the things they claim to not only do they actively endanger lives and hurt families they add to inaccessibility and grid lock they add to medical debt as people are forced I to sedentary life styles when they cannot safely pursue active one. This bill is a bill that actively advocates harm and should be rejected out outright. If you want to get rid of something get rid of Doug Ford.

        "comment": "As usual this Doug Ford conservative government are demonstrating their complete commitment to destroying any moves towards supporting the environment. Let\u2019s be honest that\u2019s what bike Lanes  are for! It\u2019s to encourage people to ride instead of getting in a gas guzzling car that carries usually only a single person. A vehicle which could carry five or six people usually but contains one and spews CO2 emissions along the way.\nThe other shocking thing about this bill is that you would actually reverse decisions that a city has made after a well thought out plan and a lot of money spent!\nRemoving bike lanes and not allowing them in future  is overstepping in a big way and none of Provincial government/Doug Ford\u2019s business.\nI do like the idea of the province buying back the 407 and honestly, you should just make both highways low-cost tow highways If the money is short. If it\u2019s not short, then both should be free. The 407 never should\u2019ve been sold in the first place that was sheer. idiocy of whatever provincial government was in  place during that time. Almost as idiotic as ripping out well thought out, already constructed bike lanes that make cyclists feel safer and make our City more environmentally attractive and also more world class: have you ever been to  Austria or Amsterdam ? They have it right- They have been making  it attractive for cyclist and the whole city for years, and everybody owns a bike there! And everybody knows the North Americans suffer more obesity than Europeans. And that\u2019s because they get out of their cars once in a while\n"

        "comment": "As an individual that contributes to this city through municipal property taxes - one that lives and works in the city of Toronto - I am strongly opposed to this bill. In living in Toronto, bike lines have provided me with a safe and expeditious means to commute around the city. Bike lanes have also created havens around the city that promote local economic growth and make the city livable. It is a complete disservice and lack of all municipal regard to take away these bike lanes.\nWe should focus efforts on expanding the many provincial-led transit projects that have seemingly come to a halt. It will cost millions of tax payer dollars to take away these bike lanes for the benefit of those who do not live nor pay property tax in the City of Toronto.\nFurthermore, should you want to alleviate congestion - I recommend removing parking lanes on arterial streets. Have drivers pay for parking on less busy side streets! Bikers - individuals who are exposed to the elements and external threats to their safety - should not have to suffer so out-of-city commuters gain a minute or two on their drive back to the suburbs.\nIf you want to encourage economic growth - make the city more like Montreal. Create streets where cars are forbidden and that encourage foot and bike traffic. These are the individuals who will spend money in your city - not those who are commuting for their 9-5 from Oakville.\nUltimately, bike lanes make our city more livable. They create neighbourhoods that encourage local traffic and provide individuals the safety they require to get around the city. As someone who also owns a car, I have never once considered bike lanes to be a hindrance to commute times. We are stuck in traffic because of the never ending construction approved in our city.\nSave our bike lanes and keep municipal policy decisions municipal.\n"

Why is the province wasting its time and resources micro managing municipalities?\nSecond, ripping out existing bike lines is just a stupid waste of money.\nYou want to reduce gridlock? Reduce the number of people in cars. That's it. That is literally the only way. There is endless data demonstrating this. You will not solve gridlock with new lanes, or by pissing away billions of dollars on a tunnel. You need to\na) Divert people away from high density areas. People should not be going THROUGH Toronto unless their destination is in Toronto\nb) Provide effective alternative transport methods such as robust public transit and avenues for active transport (LIKE BIKE LANES), so people can do things other then drive.\nc) Change zoning laws to allow for more mixed use neighbourhoods so more people can live close to where they work so they don't have to commute, or at the very least, live close to shops and services so they can access the majority of what they need either without a car, or with a very short drive.\nBlatantly ignoring evidence based solutions because the Premier has decided he has a beef with bike lanes for some reason will make gridlock worse, not better, and your time and tax payer money would be better spent addressing issues like Healthcare and Education, that are actually the province's responsibility, instead of micromanaging municipal affairs.

The provision that would require municipalities to seek provincial approval to construct or maintain bike lanes, particularly when they replace motor vehicle lanes, undermines the autonomy of municipalities like Toronto to make critical infrastructure decisions that prioritize safety, sustainability, and quality of life.\nBike lanes serve as vital infrastructure that protect cyclists from motor vehicle accidents, reduce congestion, and encourage environmentally friendly commuting options. The removal of bike lanes or the limitation of municipalities' ability to create new ones is a step backward in promoting road safety and reducing our carbon footprint. Protected bike lanes were designed to safeguard vulnerable road users, and stripping municipalities of the ability to manage their own streets will put countless lives at risk.\nMoreover, allowing the Ministry to reject or review bike lane projects based on traffic flow, rather than safety and sustainability concerns, sends a clear message that the convenience of cars is being prioritized over the safety of cyclists and pedestrians. This bill appears to promote car dependency, which contradicts the goals of reducing traffic congestion and environmental impact.\nI strongly urge the government to reconsider these changes, particularly in urban centers like Toronto where cycling infrastructure is critical to managing traffic and supporting sustainable transportation options.\nPlease reconsider Section XII, and allow municipalities to retain the authority to manage their own bike lanes without interference from the province.\nSincerely,\nA concerned Toronto resident and cyclist\n"
