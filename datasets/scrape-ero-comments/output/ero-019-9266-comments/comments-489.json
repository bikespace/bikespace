        "comment": "The solution to traffic congestion/gridlock in Toronto should not be to simply build more roads/highways. I believe that there are solutions used in other major cities that could help alleviate this congestion.\nBike lanes should remain an option for commuters. They are necessary but the design of them is key. Unfortunately the design and subsequent installation of the bike lanes along Bloor Street in the west end of the city was poor, and as a result has generated negative feedback from the public.\nI do not agree with the removal of bike lanes. I believe there is a better design solution that can meet the needs of cyclists without negative feedback. The focus should be on re-design rather than removal.\n"

Bike lanes are necessary infrastructure that should be left to individual municipalities to plan and build. Horrible proposal that should not be passed. Doing so will result in increased pedestrian deaths, more gridlock, and a toll on our already-burdened healthcare system.\n"

The provincial government should leave bike lane decisions to the municipal government instead of adding red tape and bureaucracy. No one wants cyclists right beside them, unprotected while driving on the road nor do they want them on the sidewalks beside pedestrians.\n"

Active transit, and public transit should be expanded, not reduced. I did not vote for this. Horrible, backwards thinking, and not what I voted for when I voted PC.\n"

This will do little to elucidate traffic concerns in the city.\nA better use of money would be to complete road works in a more timely fashion and schedule less projects in general allowing traffic not to be routinely held up by construction.\n"

        "comment": "I'm a young medical professional living in Toronto, and I commute by biking to work all year round. My parents live in the GTA and I have a car parked at their place. If you accept this bill, then I will not feel safe cycling anymore and will move my car downtown. Is that helping gridlock? Adding another car to the congestion downtown instead of just letting me bike?\nWhen I go onto the busy bike lanes targeted by this bill (e.g., college, university, bloor), I count hundreds of cyclists every hour. We take up very little space when we wait at red lights, but imagine if all of us were in cars instead. How much worse would you make congestion?\nEvery bike on the road is one less car. I know MANY individuals who only bike commute in Toronto because of bike lanes. I am one of these people\u2014I like how bikes reduce the number of cars, help me keep fit, and save the environment. Keep bike lanes and help me get to the Toronto Western Hospital, Toronto General Hospital, Mt. Sinai safely, and make it so that I don't need to bring another car downtown and add to the congestion.\nYou might argue every bike isn't one less car, because lots of people don't own cars downtown (unlike how I own a car and choose not to use it). That's true, but remember that people will use ubers or taxis too. Think about all the congestion near union station. Every time I take bikeshare to union station and take the go train to visit my partner or parents outside of DT, I prevent one more taxi/uber from blocking the way on Front St. I wouldn't bike down without the university avenues bike lanes.\nPlease incentivize biking, build the infrastructure for it, people LOVE it (hint: bikeshare grew 24% in 2023, to 5.7 million riders). You'll remove so many cars/traffic. Nobody has ever asked the government to remove bike lanes, you are ignoring your people. Most drivers would rather there be 100 bikes instead of 100 extra personal cars/ubers/taxis in front of them + one more car lane.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is a gross overreach of provincial jurisdiction and shows a blatant disregard for the safety and wishes of Ontarians.\nThe implementation of bicycle lanes within a municipality is purely a municipal issue and should not fall under the purview of the province. Why should someone in Thunder Bay have to put their tax dollars toward a provincial approval for possible bicycle infrastructure being built in Ottawa? Requiring any bicycle lanes that may require a reduction in available car lanes to be first approved by the province is incredibly inefficient at best, and an overreach of provincial powers at worst. Provincial resources would be far better utilized by working to complete the various Metrolinxs projects, including the Ontario Line, as these will go a long way towards reducing congestion as they provide a meaningful alternative to driving.\nAdditionally, the requirement that the bicycle infrastructure along Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue within the City of Toronto be removed is foolish. The bicycle lanes along these streets have done much towards making them safer for cyclists to traverse, removing them forces cyclists to intermingle with motor vehicle traffic which puts them at significant risk. This infrastructure was installed at significant cost by the City of Toronto over the course of several years  and was only completed recently. If this was such a severe issue that it necessitated the province to intervene than why was the construction of these lanes not stopped earlier? Why are these three lanes in the City of Toronto specifically targeted in a provincial bill? Putting provincial resources towards a purely municipal concern is fiscally irresponsible.\nLastly, the proposed changes to Highway 413 construction and granting it several exemptions are unacceptable. The province should be made to follow due-process rather than pushing through Highway 413 and granting it exemptions to fast-track its construction. Exempting the project from environmental impact assessments and the changes proposed to the creation of easements are wholly unnecessary and serve only to allow the province to proceed with construction without accountability. This lack of transparency and borderline contempt for our rules and processes is not befitting of provincial authority and is not in the best interests of Ontarians whom the province represents.\n"

        "comment": "I believe cycling infrastructure is one of the best ways to reduce car traffic, and that this bill is a step backwards. Congestion will always be an issue so long the majority of Ontarians do not have access to alternate means of transport- we simply will never have enough space for the number of lanes it would require to reduce this in a city. Offering people alternate cycling routes is better not just for cyclists, but also for those who drive, since every bike on the bike lane can be a car less on the road.\n"

I was terrified while riding my bike because there was no bike lane. I am 56 years old and I should be able to ride my bike on any main street without fear of dying, but unfortunately that is the reality because we do not have bike lanes to keep us safe. You want to take care of people\u2018s health, you have to give them the opportunity to use exercise as a way to keep themselves healthy biking is a fantastic method of exercise. You should be looking at ways to increase the amount of bike lanes, not removing them.\n"

        "comment": "I am a car driver and bike rider in downtown Toronto. I am very concerned by and in strong disagreement with this proposal to remove pre-existing bike lanes from Toronto. The available data and research shows that bike lanes do NOT cause congestion (https://www.cbc.ca/news/science/bike-lanes-impacts-1.7358319) and therefore this will be an utter waste of tax payer dollars (i.e., dollars previously spent to put in the lanes and again to remove them). If anything, the road work to remove any lanes will only worsen congestion. This is not progressive but regressive. Let's do better and find evidence based ways to help people move around this city. This is not a solution but a waste of money that ultimately does nothing to help traffic, wastes money, and endangers the lives of cyclists.\n"

I would not cycle to work (and drive instead, adding one more car to the traffic jams) if it were not for the wonderful Bloor Street and University Avenue bike lanes that allow me to do so.\nI urge Mr. Ford and his government to reconsider the plans to remove the main bike lanes in Toronto. This is a great mistake that will not guarantee the PC more votes. There is much that the PC government can do to strengthen voters' support (healthcare investments being the most important cause). Removing bike lanes is not a wise or strategically good choice.\nI count on Mr. Ford's government to change Bill 212 to delete its bike lanes' proposed changes.\nThank you for the opportunity to contribute.\n"
