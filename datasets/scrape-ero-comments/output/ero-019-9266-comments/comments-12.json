        "comment": "This proposal is extremely irresponsible because it ignores the safety and needs of Toronto residents that use cycling as a means of transportation. Reducing bike infrastructure will lead to greater risk of injury to cyclers and cause conflict between cyclers and drivers. Proper infrastructure for cycling in major metros is essential for encouraging a transition away from personal vehicles. This is not only important for our carbon transition but will in turn reduce gridlock as people see a safe alternative in cycling. The government needs to stop their war on cyclists.\n"

        "comment": "Cyclists are tax-paying citizens who deserve a fair share of the road infrastructure in our city and province. Bike lanes are not just a convenience; they are a necessity for ensuring the safety and well-being of cyclists. Removing these lanes would not only endanger cyclists but also discourage the use of environmentally friendly transportation options.\nMoreover, bike lanes contribute to reducing traffic congestion and pollution, promoting a healthier and more sustainable urban environment. They provide a safe space for cyclists, encouraging more people to choose biking over driving, which in turn benefits everyone by reducing the number of cars on the road.\nStatistics show that cities with robust bike facilities experience significant safety benefits. For example, a study found that streets with protected bike lanes had lower fatality rates for all road users, not just cyclists. In cities like Portland, the road fatality rate dropped by 75% as the bicycle mode share increased. Additionally, protected bike lanes have been shown to improve the economies of surrounding neighbourhoods. In Salt Lake City, sales rose by 8.8% for stores located along a protected bike lane.\nLocally, Toronto has seen significant benefits from bike lanes. For instance, when protected bike lanes were installed on Bloor Street, collisions between cars and bikes fell by 71%. Furthermore, a study conducted by Ryerson University estimated that fully separated cycle tracks along Bloor-Danforth could prevent between 153 and 182 injuries over the next decade. Additionally, a poll found that 84% of Torontonians support the construction of protected bike lanes, with strong support consistent throughout all districts in the city.\nI urge you to reconsider the plans to reduce and remove bike lane infrastructure in Toronto. Instead, we should be investing in expanding and improving these lanes to support a growing number of cyclists and to promote a greener, safer, and more inclusive city.\n"

The only solution is making it as easy as possible to take something other than a car. This will improve driving time for those that do HAVE to drive and dramatically improve the life of everyone who is able to take a more active form of transportation.\nThe idea that we're going to somehow make the roads work properly is literal insanity. Have you seen how big cities work? They have good transit. And they toll cars coming into the downtown core! That's the ONLY way.\n"

        "comment": "In the same way the federal government shouldn't interfere with provincial affairs, the provincial govt shouldn't interfere in municipal affairs.\nThat said, bike lanes reduce congestion, and the best place to place them are on already busy thoroughfares. A bike lane can accommodate hundreds of bikes and other types of active transport over the same period of time that only a few cars might pass on the same street.\nProtected bike lanes on streets make streets safer for all users, not just cyclists. Numerous studies prove that motorists slow down and are more cautious on streets with bike lanes.\nCycling not only cuts congestion and pollution, but leads to a more active society, in turn cutting healthcare costs over the long term. Moreover, bikes and other forms of active transit result in less wear and tear on city streets. More cycling is less damaging to infrastructure than more cars.\nOntario doesn't need to look too far to see just how beneficial cycling can be. Look at Montreal, which has been aggressively developing their cycling infrastructure. Winter cycling, bike highways, a comprehensive, city-wide bike sharing network, 1,000 kms of bike lanes. The result is vibrant, viable urban neighbourhoods and an unparalleled quality of life. Where Toronto struggles to bring life back to the city, it has fully returned in Montreal.\nBest of all, cyclists and pedestrians spend more than motorists and patronize small businesses more often. See the city of London's study on the business stimulus effects of cycling.\nAll across North America, politicians have added more car lanes, more parking, and the end result is greater car dependency, and cities that have lost their supporting tax base. Montreal has gone in the opposite direction and has maintained its position as one of the most desirable cities in the world to live in for many years. Cycling and active transport is a key component of this desirability. Giving people more alternatives to using their cars means fewer people using their cars, in turn lowering congestion, emissions, pollution, and freeing up more parking spaces.\n"

Bike lanes made biking to the supermarket, pharmacy and library possible. Instead of driving, I chose biking.\nI am scared of biking on roads without a bike lane. After moving downtown, I find myself frequent shops / businesses that are located on bike lane accessible streets.\nOverall, bike infrastructure has made my life healthier, shaped my spending decisions, and reduced my car on the road.\n"

Requiring municipal governments to seek provincial approval for bike lanes undermines local decision-making and stifles efforts to promote sustainable transportation. Protected bike lanes have been shown to encourage cycling, which can lead to fewer cars on the road and reduced congestion. Instead of hindering progress towards more bike-friendly communities, we should be empowering municipalities to create safe and accessible cycling infrastructure. Let's prioritize initiatives that support active transportation and reduce traffic congestion, rather than restricting them.\n"

All evidence points to a relationship between reducing car traffic and giving residents alternative forms of transport, and there is a huge untapped demand for alternative transportation from folks who struggle to believe they will ever be safe on a bike as long as our government prioritizes drivers at the expense of everyone else.\n"

My safety, and the safety of other cyclists, should be important. By removing bike lanes the province will be CREATING gridlock, not alleviating it.

It is an extreme example of overreach by the province, which should be leaving decisions about bike lanes to the municipalities.\nRequiring the minister's approval is a prime example of government adding more, not less, red tape.\nThe bill is also obviously counterproductive. Ripping out bike lanes will only force the bikes to share lanes with cars, is both more dangerous for all commuters, and will slow down the speed of vehicular traffic. One only needs to look at Yonge St from Queen to Bloor to see how dangerous and frustrating it is to share the road with the hundreds of e-bike delivery drivers.\nLastly, ripping out bike lanes where they have already been installed on a permanent basis like on Bloor and University will require costly and time consuming construction which will, again, slow down traffic on these key corridors.\nThis bill is an egregious example of provincial overreach, ineffective in achieving its goals, and a costly waste of taxpayer dollars.\n"

        "comment": "The idea that blocking the installation of, or more bafflingly, removing existing bike lanes shows that this government has no interest in research-based solutions to improving traffic congestion. Every study conducted has shown that providing people with viable alternatives to driving will reduce traffic congestion, as it gets people out of cars, leaving space for those who must, or even prefer, to drive.\nFurthermore, removing bike lanes forces cyclists into the car lanes, which is dangerous for them and drivers. To add to this, because of the way this \u201cargument\u201d has been framed by this government, you are further endangering cyclists by creating animosity between drivers and cyclists, which WILL result in drivers acting aggressively to the cyclists who will now be FORCED to share the car lanes with them. The blood of any dead or injured cyclists will rest solely on your hands.\nLastly - this province is experiencing REAL problems with underfunded health care, education, and housing. The fact that this bike lane issue is becoming a provincial matter at all is laughable and shameful. Leave bike lane decisions to the municipalities and focus on helping ALL ONTARIANS, instead of trying to stick it to people in Toronto. This government is a disgrace.\n"

        "comment": "Ontario does not need more highways to reduce gridlock. We need better transit and more support for walking, cycling and other emission free and healthy modes of mobility. It is literally the least intelligent thing in the world right now to add red tape and tie municipalities hands regarding their ability to take action to reduce gridlock in an emission free manner and in a way that suits them best. Ontario needs more natural and green spaces, less noise and less pollution. To push through highways that no one wants, that carve up nature and farmland, and that encourage gridlock (especially when we have underused highways like the 407) makes zero sense. To speak about 'common sense' and 'red tape' reduction as key values and then spend time and money on backwards regulations such as this one makes one wonder what the real motivation for this regulation is behind closed doors. Focus on adding trains (especially rapid ones), finishing the subway extensions, adding electric buses, adding and improving bike lanes and trails, and encouraging municipal planning that allows people to easily walk to local grocery stores, schools, churches, shops, etc. Stop wasting our time and money, please!\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposal to remove bike lanes as a means to reduce road congestion. Removing bike lanes will not only fail to alleviate congestion but will likely exacerbate the problem by increasing the number of cars on the road. With fewer dedicated spaces for cyclists, more commuters will be forced to drive, leading to longer travel times, more CO2 emissions, and greater environmental harm.\nFurthermore, bike lanes provide essential safety for cyclists, promoting active transportation, which has clear public health benefits. Eliminating these lanes puts both cyclists and drivers at greater risk, as it increases the likelihood of accidents. This will inadvertently create more delays and more congestion\nIn short, reducing bike lanes is counterproductive. We should be encouraging more sustainable, eco-friendly modes of transport, not discouraging them. Putting the government's money into reliable public transportation will have the effect that the city is currently looking for.\n"

        "comment": "Hello! 39 year old Toronto cyclist. I ride my bike 12 months out of the year and I have no plans to stop. Protected bike lanes have been an absolute godsend. I no longer fear for my life whenever I go to work, visit my parents, head to new neighbourhoods and discover new shops and restaurants. It is my favourite way to enjoy my city!\nOf course, there are situations when I am forced to share lanes with cars and trucks. And if you've ever had the pleasure, it's very clear that cyclists are NOT welcome  and are seen as an annoyance and in the way. This results in terrifying close calls as most drivers fail to respect the 1 metre rule, or red lights.\nI am a woman with a family that loves me and the idea that my safety does not matter to the people in Queen's park is deeply concerning and saddens me to no end. While I can understand the frustration of drivers, it's shocking that this government has chosen to scapegoat cyclists when there is clearly a confluences of factors that have led to the gridlock we see today: lack of transit options, underfunded transit, concurrent construction projects on major streets, on street parking - to name but a few. Furthermore, it is shocking to me that a conservative government is once again resorting to meddling with municipal affairs when there are much bigger issues facing the province.\nPerhaps I would be more convinced by this government's plan to prevent and remove bike lanes if they provided actual data and studies that proved that bike lanes are the cause of gridlock. As of right now this plan seems purely political and another example of the Ford government's insistence on grievance politics rather than sound governance.\n"

        "comment": "Cycling is a healthy, cheap, low-impact, and space-efficient mode of transportation for our cities but it can only become widespread if people have access to a comprehensive network of safe bike infrastructure. We are making good progress toward that goal but this legislation threatens all of that work with red tape and even regressive removal of existing infrastructure. Doubling down on car dominance of our public spaces at this critical juncture may relieve some congestion in the short term but will ultimately entrench us deeper into car-dependency. We will never escape traffic congestion and we will struggle to meet our environmental goals as long as people have no choice but to drive.\nOn a personal note, I cannot afford a car and rely on safe bike infrastructure to buy food, get to work, and see my friends. This legislation directly threatens my personal safety and freedom to access parts of my city that are currently too unsafe to travel to outside of a car.\n"
