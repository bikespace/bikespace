I live in downtown Toronto (m5R), and the driving is impossible around me.\nAlso please remove the ridiculous bike lane on Bayview South. Currently no cars are allowed to go north from the waterfront up to River Street (it\u2019s for bikes only!!!!) and I\u2019ve rarely seen a bike on that route.\n"

Too craven to stand up for what is right? The plan isn't even clever or devious - it's transparently idiotic. It will not serve to reduce congestion in the least, but it will make driving less safe for cyclists, pedestrians and drivers; it will make Toronto look like a provincial back water; it will hurt the businesses along Bloor, Yonge and University; and it will make Toronto a worse city in every way.\nCongratulations everyone! You have *checks notes* owned the libs. Imagine having a majority government in the biggest and economically most powerful province in Canada, and then spending all your time and energy interfering in local Toronto decisions. Forget housing, education or healthcare, you have put your brains together and decided to focus on selling the Green Belt, ruining Ontario Place and breaking contracts at a price tag of a billion dollars.\nTo the ambitious young political minions reading this, is this what you what you wanted your life to be? Is enacting spiteful, harmful public policy why you went into politics? Have you no self-respect at all? Ontario deserves better than this. Toronto deserves better than this. You deserve better than this.\n"

The PCs are supposed to be the party of less government and yet here is another example of a municipality needing to defer to an ideological provincial body rather than address its own needs. I am embarrassed to live in this city and this province. Toronto always wants to be New York so here's a chance to follow their lead and add more bike lanes, not rip them out.\n"

        "comment": "The additional bureaucracy and bigger government proposed here is baffling. Leave municipal decisions to municipalities and start fixing real problems like healthcare, mass transit, and cost of living.\nBike lanes serve to reduce the number of vehicles on the road by providing a safe alternative to driving. Removing bike lanes will only serve to increase traffic as cyclists return to cars (such as myself) and cyclists will now block an entire lane of traffic without a dedicated lane regardless. There will be no reason not to ride down core streets and block traffic if there isn't a better, safer option with a dedicated bike lane.\nIf reducing traffic congestion were a real concern, solutions to get people out of cars and into denser forms of transportation would be the priority. Instead, the province's Metrolinx project are languishing.\nIf emergency vehicle response times were a real concern, then there are simpler measures such as removing parking around intersections and clamping down on fraudulent handicapped permit usage that would lead to real results.\n"

        "comment": "Climate change, caused and accelerated by Green House Gas (GHG) emissions, is threatening our lives, prosperity and future.\nTransportation is the largest source of GHG emissions in Ontario, largely caused by cars and trucks. To reduce transportation emissions we need more transit and active transportation (walking and cycling).\nTo encourage more cycling we need safe, physically separated cycling infrastructure. We already see rising ridership, even though the cycling network in Toronto is incomplete as of yet.\nInstead of trying to tell Toronto how to run the city, to score some cheap political points, your government should invest in municipalities to build more safe and physically separated bike-lanes. Such an investment by the Ontario Government would foster more active transportation that is emissions free, affordable, convenient, fast and healthy.\nPlease concentrate on your provincial work and ensure that you are build more public transit. For example, you could demand that the Eglington Crosstown has to be up and running in the 1st quarter of 2025. Or you could invest more money to electrify Go trains and thus further reduce GHG emissions from the transportation sector.\nDestroying Toronto's investment into safe cycling infrastructure is not the answer, it is just wasting time and money, increasing Ontario's GHG emissions, and at the same time endangering the health and safety of Ontarians that decide to use a cheap, healthy, convenient and fast way to get around, a bike.\n"

        "comment": "I am begging you to make evidence-based decisions. A few people complaining that bikes cause congestion does not make it true. If all the people on bikes got into cars, that would make it worse.\nBike lanes save lives. Doug Ford knew this in 2018 when he biked with Jagmeet Singh. I don't know what has changed since then.\n- bike lanes save lives\n- bike lanes are better for businesses along those routes (again, see the evidence, not a few uninformed and self-serving anecdotes)\n- bike lanes are better for the environment and contribute to better air quality\n- bike lanes are better for emergency vehicles because bikes can get out of the way quicker\n- bike lanes are important for people with disabilities (yes, bikes can be mobility devices, in addition to the lanes being used by wheelchair users and mobility scooters) - removing these bike lanes could be a violation of AODA\nThere is absolutely NO evidence at all that bike lanes cause congestion. They are merely being scapegoated for short-sighted transportation policy.\nAnd Doug Ford also said that municipalities know what's best for themselves, so he has no reason to inflict his opinion on the municipalities. I'm afraid this is merely pandering to his base in advance of an election, which is a crappy way to govern.\nPlease, please, please refer to evidence on this. I am begging you. Your decision will kill people. Please don't do this.\n"

        "comment": "It\u2019s hard to imagine a bigger waste of provincial resources than this proposal. If the city consults with the people who live and work in that community and they agree that there should be a bike lane, why would the province ever need to step in? To defend whose interests? People who have driven in from other municipalities?\nNot only is it ridiculous from a political-economic standpoint, but the proposal likely wouldn\u2019t even achieve its goal. Study after study shows that adding more lanes for cars does not actually reduce congestion. Construction makes congestion worse; construction of the kind required to remove (popular and well used) bike lanes.\nBike lanes make drivers and cyclists safer, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and encourage a healthy lifestyle. Allowing the province to veto\u2014or, even more absurdly, force the removal of\u2014a bike lane is simply a way for the government to drum up support among its car-reliant base at the expense of the rights and desires of those living and working along these bike routes.\n"

In the past 30 years of biking in Toronto, I have been hit by no fewer than 5 cars.\nThe last accident could have KILLED me had the SUV driver been going any faster -- and that accident could not have happened had the bike lane that is now finally on Woodbine Avenue been there then! That bike lane, had it been installed earlier, would have saved the healthcare system all of the money it cost to hospitalize me, perform 2 surgeries to fix my broken bones, etc., never mind the time and lost productivity because I had to be off work for months to recover.\nThis Proposed Bill ignores all the research that shows very conclusively that bike lanes reduce gridlock and emissions. This Proposed Bill inflicts wasteful and onerous expenses as well as unnecessary red tape on municipalities that need every dollar to deal with the actually urgent issues like housing. The Proposed Bill also sets a dangerous precedent and erodes democracy by overriding municipal decisions, made by representatives who have been elected to make determinations on local issues.\nI most strongly object to the proposal to remove already existing bike lanes in Toronto. This is a callous and daft idea. The bike lanes on Bloor, Yonge and University make Toronto more cosmopolitan, more livable, prettier and enhance the safety and physical health of Torontonians and our visitors. Above all, when well constructed and separated from traffic, bike lanes are literally LIFE SAVING!\nPlease, do not allow this Proposed Bill to proceed any further.\n"

City residents can hold local officials accountable for all decisions about infrastructure. The Province would be egregiously overreaching to step in and negate these local decisions.\nI get around Toronto by every mode - on foot, cycling, transit and driving. I have made extensive use of the existing network of protected bike lanes, and I see a pressing need for more bike lanes to add connectivity to reach a complete grid network. I strongly object to this power grab to undo what local democracy has already decided to build!\n"

As someone who has previously been hit by a car while I was in a non-separated bike lane and got a concussion despite having a helmet on and obeying the rules of the road, I cannot believe that my life and that of countless cyclists including my young kid is not of value.\nHow can you value cyclists less than car drivers?\nStop Bill 212. Do not take bike lanes away from cities and do not require cities to apply for additional layers of bureaucracy to provide the best roads for all of their residents.\nI pay for those roads and deserve to have my life as well as that of my kid protected. My kid literally begs me to go in the bike lane as I insist she go on the sidewalk because of the level of danger involved in riding on the road, unless it is a completely separated bike lane. What should I tell my kid? The premier of your province wants to get rid of bike lanes because he doesn't care about your life or that of your mother's and that of many cyclists.\nStop Bill 212.\n"

        "comment": "I'm EXTREMELY disappointed that the Province of Ontario would think removing bike lanes would do anything to improve gridlock.\nThe population of Toronto has growth significantly over the last number of years, as you are aware, and to accommodate this growth we need to prioritize active and public transportation NOT getting residents to travel around by car. Cars take up the most space on our roads, contribute to CO2, do not promote a healthy population, and cause pedestrian and cyclist fatalities. I have no idea why the province would want to promote this type of transportation rather than putting in place investments and policies than promote public transportation and active transportation. From my perspective, we should be investing provincial resources to promote this type of transportation. We should be making it easy for residents to cycle to their destinations by adding bike lanes throughout the City of Toronto.\nFurthermore, why is the province overstepping into municipal governance. The City of Toronto is responsible for the roads and movement of residents within the city, NOT the province.\n"
