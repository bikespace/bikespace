        "comment": "I don\u2019t like this proposal. Many studies have shown that adding bike lanes reduces car traffic and congestion, and adding more lanes to cities would not make cars move faster unless there were no traffic lights. If the province is serious about gridlock, why not focus on more efficient smart traffic lights and intersection designs that include turning lanes so cars aren\u2019t stuck behind other turning cars?\nEven if bike lanes did make traffic lanes move more slowly, how many biker-deaths is worth it for faster traffic? In a province with a healthcare crisis, it seems unconscionable to prioritize (assumed, but not proven) slight time gains in a non-active form of transportation over the lives and safety of bikers who use a form of transportation that makes them, and the province by extension, passively healthier.\nThis act should consider street parking lanes rather than (or in addition to) bike lanes. Street parking lanes take up as much or more space than bike lanes, and involve more interactions with traffic that could cause lanes to stop and congestion to increase. For example, when someone is parking on the street, they generally block a lane and briefly stop traffic there. As well, street parking is incredibly inexpensive given the cost of space anywhere else in the downtown of cities. Removing street parking on major roads would be cheaper, faster, and likely more helpful for traffic than removing bike lanes.\nRemoving bike lanes is not a sensible or serious proposal for reducing grid lock, and it has a myriad of downsides which make it an actively harmful decision.\n"

This government is being ridiculous, wasting tax payers money for plans that defy logic and reason.\nPlease put money and time into projects that matter and will help people in Ontario.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes provide an accessible, affordable and necessary transportation option. There is limited room for volume on available roads that are alleviated by reducing cars through trains and alternate means of transportation - this provides effective and expedient strategies to allow large numbers of people to move through a dense city. The volume of a car, SUV, truck, and possibly most often with a single person driving, is arguably the greatest contributor to gridlock. It would be wise and grounded to evaluate this condition before targeting bike lanes, which occupy a fraction of vehicular volume.\n"

        "comment": "I am a driver, and a cyclist, and a pedestrian.  I have benefitted hugely from the implementation of bike lanes:\n#1:  It is based in populist ideas of how traffic works, rather than actual traffic management science.  I beg this government to actually talk to experts in how and why traffic congestion forms.  The idea that removing bike lanes will improve congestion goes against the way reality works.  Removing bike lanes increases congestion (from bikers who will now drive), and increases death and injury for bikers who continue to bike on roads without protected lanes.  That is, more injuries, more accidents, more congestion.  If this government is serious about reducing congestion, then they should be investing in improvements to regional transit to give people non-car options for getting around.  Building more highways funnels more cars into a city where there just isn't enough room for them, creating more, not less, congestion.\n(Also, having parking along main roads closes a lane of traffic, and I don't see this bill suggesting taking out parking.  Taking out a bike lane *is* taking out a lane of traffic, and often one with more throughput than the car lanes.)\n#2:  It is a huge waste of money doing something unnecessary.  We already have a level of government to manage municipal roads -- our municipal governments.  They have traffic experts and city planners and we pay them to do the work of planning this stuff.  Having another level of government paying people to double-guess the experts -- apparently based on nothing but the Premier's \"feels\" -- is a waste of taxpayer money.  We already have more qualified people doing the work -- leave them alone.\nTraffic congestion *is* cars.  Anything you do to encourage more driving will increase traffic.  If the Provincial Government is serious about wanting to reduce traffic congestion and get people to places faster, they would focus on building more frequent and reliable regional transit, to give people more non-car options.  This bill will achieve the opposite of what it sets out to do, at a completely unnecessary cost to the taxpayer.\n"

If bike lanes are removed, I will still ride my bike. I will slow down traffic, I will cause congestion. The bike lanes allow for us to ride in safety and to get to our destinations quickly. It is anti-democratic and a gross overreach of provincial authority to override our municipal councils to ban local development decisions.\nBike lanes are efficient, cheap, save lives, and improve traffic according to every peer reviewed study. I will link to this recent one done by the university of Toronto: https://news.engineering.utoronto.ca/machine-learning-analysis-sheds-li\u2026\nI quote the article: \"Another key finding was that there are some routes that appeared to be essential no matter what strategy was pursued.\"\n\u201cFor example, the bike lanes along Bloor West show up in all of the scenarios,\u201d says Saxe.\nThis regressive policy should be immediately withdrawn.\n"

Passing this legislation will (a)not alleviate traffic congestion, (b)will lead to more injuries and deaths, (c)encroaches on the autonomy of municipalities, and (d)leads to more bloated and less effective governance.\nIn order for Ontario's cities and municipalities to grow and thrive, local governments must be able to properly plan for appropriate transportation infrastructure and make decisions that best serve their local economies and the health of their citizens. Decisions about adding active transportation infrastructure must remain in the hands of officials responsible to local constituents and the transportation experts working for the municipalities. It is neither within the province's jurisdiction nor its mandate to get bogged down in local decision-making \u2014 there are much more critical, province-wide issues that Ontario must address instead.\nAny move to make it more burdensome to build walking and cycling infrastructure within municipalities will result in greater expense and worse health outcomes \u2014 and will only make gridlock worse, not better.\nThe installation of protected bike infrastructure in my municipality has made it easier, safer, and more joyful for me to move around. I fear that blocking new infrastructure (or even worse, removing existing infrastructure) will pose a direct threat to my health and safety.\nThis proposed legislation is not responsible and it is certainly not conservative by any definition of the word. I will be urging my local representatives and my MPPs to vote against this bill. I will also be personally asking my family members who live elsewhere in rural Ontario \u2014 family members who are very concerned about my own health and safety \u2014 to pressure their own MPPs to vote against this bill as well.\nThe conservative and responsible position is to allow municipalities to add in active transportation infrastructure as they deem fit \u2014 and to see the improvements in local economies and public health that immediately follow.\n"

        "comment": "I appreciate the government's efforts to reduce gridlock and prioritize efficient transportation. However, the proposal requiring municipalities to seek provincial approval for bike lanes that remove a traffic lane seems to overlook the benefits of dedicated cycling infrastructure. Research has shown that bike lanes can reduce congestion by promoting cycling over car use, leading to fewer vehicles on the road, as seen in cities like New York and Paris. Additionally, induced demand suggests that adding more car lanes does not solve congestion in the long term, while safer, dedicated bike lanes can encourage more people to cycle. This reduces traffic and emissions, improves safety for cyclists and pedestrians, and can even boost local business activity.\nBike lanes should be seen as an integral part of a modern, sustainable transportation system. Giving the province veto power over municipalities' bike lane plans could undermine local knowledge and priorities. A more collaborative approach between the province and municipalities that recognizes the benefits of cycling infrastructure is essential.\n"

        "comment": "Subject: Closing Loopholes in Bill 212: Support for Highway Act Amendments\nI am writing to bring your attention to potential loopholes in Bill 212 related to modifications to the Highway Traffic Act. While I support the bill's intent to limit bicycle lanes where car lanes are affected, I believe certain provisions could be exploited or misapplied without stricter definitions and processes. Below, I outline the key amendments, concerns, and areas where further clarity is needed to ensure the legislation is effective and fair.\n1. Ministry Approval Requirement:\nMunicipalities must seek Ministry of Transportation approval for bike lane designs that reduce the number of lanes available for motor vehicle traffic.\nThis adds a potential bottleneck, which could delay or block bike lane projects, especially in larger municipalities with multiple proposals.\n2. Traffic Flow Considerations:\nThe Ministry will assess whether a proposed bike lane would \"unduly diminish the orderly movement of motor vehicle traffic.\"\nThe term \"unduly diminish\" is subjective and open to broad interpretation, which could lead to inconsistent decision making.\n3. Existing Projects Exempt from New Rules:\nBike lanes already under contract or in progress before the bill\u2019s enactment are exempt from these new requirements, creating inconsistencies across municipalities.\nSome projects could bypass approval simply because they were initiated earlier, regardless of their impact on traffic.\n4. Regulatory Discretion:\nThe Minister has the power to exempt municipalities or highways from these new rules through regulation.\nFor example, if Mississauga were granted an exemption, it could proceed with the Bloor Street bike lanes without needing additional data or ministry approval. This creates opportunities for projects to proceed without meeting the law's intended standards.\n5. Information Requirements for Traffic Data:\nMunicipalities must provide traffic data to support bike lane designs, but the bill does not specify the type, quality, or relevance of the data required.\nMunicipalities could technically submit any data, including offpeak traffic numbers, minimal reports, or misleading statistics, to meet the requirement. This leaves room for weak or irrelevant data to influence decisions.\nIdentified Loopholes and Risks\n1. Ambiguity in Definitions:\nThe bill does not clearly define what constitutes a \"reduction in marked lanes for motor vehicle traffic.\" Municipalities could argue that certain bike lane designs do not meet this definition and avoid ministry approval altogether.\n2. Broad Exemption Powers:\nSection 195.2 (7)(c) allows the Minister to exempt entire municipalities or highways from the bill\u2019s requirements.\n If Mississauga or another municipality is granted an exemption, they could implement bike lanes that reduce car lanes without providing traffic data or ministry oversight, leading to unequal treatment between cities.\n3. Lack of an Exemption Process:\nThe bill does not specify how exemptions should be requested, which gives municipalities leeway to bypass formal processes. For example:\n    No clear application procedures, timelines, or evidence requirements are outlined.\n    A city like Mississauga could informally request an exemption\u2014for instance, through a letter\u2014without proper public consultation or input.\n    The Ministry could grant exemptions without public explanation, leading to a lack of transparency and accountability.\nTo close these loopholes, I recommend the following improvements to the legislation:\n1. Define Key Terms: Provide a clear definition for what constitutes a reduction in motor vehicle lanes to avoid misinterpretation.\n2. Standardize Data Requirements: Establish specific criteria for the type, quality, and timeframe of traffic data to ensure decisions are based on relevant and accurate information.\n3. Formalize the Exemption Process: Introduce clear guidelines for municipalities to request exemptions, including application procedures, timelines, and public consultations to ensure transparency.\n4. Limit Discretionary Powers: Require public disclosure and justification for all exemptions granted by the Ministry to ensure fairness and accountability.\nI appreciate the intent of Bill 212 to balance motor vehicle and bike lane infrastructure, but these gaps need to be addressed to prevent the legislation from being misused or inconsistently applied. I trust the Ministry will take these concerns into account and amend the bill accordingly.\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\n"

        "comment": "A completely asinine and half baked idea meant solely to pander to Ford's political base. Cyclists have a right to be safe on the roads and removing bike lanes to create more lanes for cars will have zero effect on reducing gridlock. Study after study have shown that the most effective way to reduce gridlock is to remove cars from the road, and creating, rather than destroying cycling infrastructure, is the best way to do that. To absolutely no one's surprise, however, Ford is yet again showing his utter contempt and disregard for experts who dedicate their careers studying these topics, all in the name of winning an election. Beyond the sheer stupidity of shirking mountains of data opposing this idiotic decision (and spending millions of tax dollars to rip up bike lanes that in some cases were recently completed), this bill further degrades our ability to choose more eco-conscious means of transportation as we approach a climate change tipping point. Finally, not a single person has ever travelled to a world-class city (all of which promote rather than deter bicycles) and thought \"you know what his place needs less of? Cycling infrastructure\".\n"

Removing them would discourage cycling and increase traffic congestion, while diminishing the progress made toward sustainable urban mobility.\n"
