        "comment": "This bike lanes conversation breaks my heart. I don't understand why this is even open for discussion. I've been riding my bike to the downtown central part of Toronto since 1972 for university + then work + as a means of transportation generally. I have only recently become nervous + apprehensive. Drivers are so aggressive with construction obstruction + congestion making them make quick + impulsive manoeuvres. I was relieved when cyclists were given serious consideration + cars might not be given priority. I'm fortunate enough to have lived in Europe + cycled in bike friendly communities where cycling is a way of life. It is so distressing knowing our future generations are already compromised by the foolish + selfish behaviour by the adult population of the past + present. Pollution is a problem. The loss of green space + permeable ground in our city will exacerbate our current + future weather related challenges by creating more hard road surfaces. We need better public transportation + a safer cycling + walking environment. I'm astonished that any expenditure to rip out existing bike lanes would even be considered when that money could be put to the better use of creating new less or non-polluting options. Please make a commitment to protect cyclists + our environment.\n"

For our members \"Share the Road\" is not a slogan but a core value grounded in safety for both\nriders and motorist alike.    I must voice my opposition to the proposal that the Goverment of Ontario to require approval for bike lanes in municipal roads that are not part of the provincial highways network.  The  issue is one of juridictional authority.   Municipalities are responsible for the planning and implementation of transportation infrastructure and do so in accordance with their own authority and consultation with engineers, local residents, motorists, cyclists, businesses, and other stakeholders.\nThis Bill is an overreach of provincial oversight into municipal affairs.\nWhile I recognize the need for proper planning of all roadways in Ontario for safety, traffic management and cost, the final decision must rest with the respective taxpayers, planners and goverment of the effected municipalities.\nRespectfully submitted\n"

        "comment": "I am not someone that usually comments on legislation, but I feel very passionately about bike infrastructure, and the specific mention of ripping out the new(ish) bike lanes on Yonge, University, and Bloor in Toronto doesn\u2019t seem to make sense. It seems like so much of the reason why these bike lanes want to be removed is due to low usage, but when starting to make the bike network it was understood that we wouldn\u2019t see its maximum potential as far as usage until the network started nearing completion, but we are not near that point yet, with a lot of fragmented and disconnected segments that would need to be finished before we can start seeing the return on investment. I don\u2019t understand why we would actively try to go backwards saying that we\u2019ve built doesn\u2019t work when we haven\u2019t finished building all of the connections needed to make it a finished network. I am disgusted as to what this would entail for Toronto and the rest of the province, as someone who spends a great deal of time in both Guelph and Toronto.\n"

        "comment": "It is absolutely atrocious that the provincial government believes it has the authority to bypass any opinion or rule of the city and spend taxpayer money to rip up bike lanes that are keeping vulnerable cyclists alive and actually reducing traffic by providing alternative transit options. We are hitting a record high number of people who have been killed on bicycles this year because we have not done enough to create safe cycling infrastructure and the notion of reducing what we are trying to build is just mind-blowing. The evidence for not going ahead with this project that was presented at the city council meeting is clear - tearing up these bike lanes will NOT improve traffic and there are no alternative side streets on which they lanes could be placed without obscene amounts of money being spent, property being acquired, etc. This is clearly an issue that Doug Ford is trying to use to distract from other problems that is government has already/will continue to create such as the Eglinton LRT.\n"

        "comment": "I object to Bill 212 for every possible reason, but let me outline my top objections:\na)  It is a firm case of provincial overreach, governing that which is within the City of Toronto and governed by the City of Toronto Act.\nb)  The Ontario Government has not consulted with sufficient members of the affected communities, so has no idea if this is what the voters want or not.\nc)  The Ontario Government has not conducted any research to determine if the changes required by the bill will in fact achieve the stated goals of reducing gridlock or saving time.  It will undoubtedly cost MORE time for the many users of the bike lanes (including food delivery services), and the construction work required will cause more gridlock for years.\nd)  The bill does not specify who will pay for any work required under the bill.  I support the City of Toronto's decision asking the province to pay any and all costs related to the design, implementation or traffic management that would be required.\nPlease repeal this flawed bill immediately. The Ontario government must focus on provincial areas of responsibility such as providing public healthcare, building housing, and stop destroying the province by paving arable land, building unnecessary highways, and wasting effort on silly tunnel ideas.\n"

        "comment": "This bill would be detrimental to Ontario and Toronto in several ways.\nRemoving automobile lanes in favour of expanded bike lanes improves safety of roadways by inducing less automotive demand and usage, removing the most dangerous element on the road network today - the car. It allows room to provide enhanced protection to cyclists along these critical thoroughfares, far more efficient than taking winding back streets.\nFurthermore it increases business along these roadways by encouraging cyclist usage, a demographic more likely to stop mid-trip and purchase goods/services than someone in a car with a set destination and little desire to park up in the middle of their trip to grab something at a cafe or other small business.\nThere are many more concrete arguments as to why bike lanes are essential and the current ones along major thoroughfares must be kept and expanded. I will conclude by saying that this bill is a counter-productive effort on the part of the Ford administration to speed up Mr. Ford\u2019s commute to Queens Park under the guise of a bill to facilitate travel across the city, which will only result in less cheap, efficient and easy transportation for many, decreased business for some, and the deaths of far too many cyclists on unprotected main routes should the bill go forward.\nSincerely,\nA Toronto cyclist and driver, frequent user of Yonge, University and Bloor bike lanes.\n"

The city's data show that these lanes reduce gridlock by removing cars from the roads with safe, environmental, healthy transportation alternatives which millions of Torontonians like myself use regularly. Governments ignore science at their peril. If this provincial government wishes to declare war on the large municipalities to score political points with its base, ignoring the rights and wishes of the local citizens, it will pay an enormous political price.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are important. The more people who feel safe riding a bike in the city, the fewer cars will be causing congestion so people who need to drive are unable to get where they're going. It's better for the environment to facilitate non-polluting forms of transportation. It's also good for businesses along bike lanes. It's often easy to park a bike when a shop catches your eye. Bike lanes, like sidewalks, and parks and trees, are an integral part of liveable cities. Please protect the ones we have and build more.\n"

        "comment": "I'm very concerned about the idea of removing bike lanes in my neighbourhood (West end of Toronto).  With higher density housing in local neighbourhoods (related to new condo and housing developments, which are important and needed), the number of people on the streets is ever-increasing.   Forward-thinking policies are needed which discourage people from considering individual vehicles the main or best option for travel around an increasingly densely populated city.    Building more and better public transit options, and increasing separate lanes for smaller vehicles is necessary for allowing people to get around safely, with far less congestion.    Refusing to change with times and insisting that \"most\" people \"need\" cars for transportation, while making alternatives (such as public transit and biking) unsafe and undesirable is going to put Toronto in a terrible position in upcoming decades.  When a city such as Toronto is congested,  both the economy and quality of life for residents suffer.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose this bill, as someone who commutes regularly by bike. I try to cycle year-round. In Hamilton, the construction of bike lanes has proved the idea of \"build it and they will come\". In the past decade, I have seen the number of cyclists explode, especially as people feel safer cycling on the city.\nThis bill will make people less safe and force them to purchase vehicles, worsening traffic. This will become exponentially worse with the population growth in metropolitan areas and suburban areas alike, and cities will be unable to fix this. Why ban the solution?\nAdditionally, the first purchase of my bike as a teenager unlocked so many areas of the city for me. I was finally able to get a better job, go to the mall, and volunteer regularly. I, along with many others, cannot afford the costs with maintaining a car. What will happen to us who cannot afford cars? It will become significantly more expensive, timely, and difficult for me to go to work, go to school, and even buy groceries. With the current difficulties regarding cost of living, this makes life so much harder. Why hurt us lower income citizens?\nHaving been hit by a turning car, I would feel far less safe cycling. I have seen those in our community--neighbours, friends, loved ones--become critically injured, and even pass away. Ontarians, children and elderly, have died due to a lack of safe cycling infrastructure and will die as a result of this bill. Why make our cities less safe?\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nI'm writing to state my opposition to Bill 212 which proposes ripping out stretches of bike lanes along several Toronto streets, namely Bloor street. I'm a Toronto resident; I live along Bloor St. West and work on the Danforth.\nThe Bill suggests bike lanes congest car traffic; this is simply not true and has been refuted time and time again by numerous studies conducted in major cities all over the world.\nThe Bill also suggests that businesses are adversely impacted by bike lanes which is also untrue. Economic Impact Studies done by The Centre for Active Transportation in 2009, 2010, and 2017 all suggest the opposite; most customers are arriving by foot or by bike. Not by car.\nIn my own experience working for a small business on the Danforth for several years now; most of our customers arriving from outside the immediate neighborhood are arriving by bike or by public transit and very few by car.\nWhen the TTC was rumored to go on strike early this year I was relieved in knowing I could bike a straight line from my doorstep at Spadina and Bloor all the way to my job on Danforth past Chester Ave. in less time it would take on the subway and save myself the $40 or so it would have costed to get an Uber.\nRemoving parts of these bike lanes, some only just completed within the last few years, would be costly, further congest roads already heavily burdened by construction, fly in the face of Ontario's climate commitments and would remove a valuable way of transportation for many thousands of Torontonians.\nKindly,\nRenee\n"

        "comment": "I'm both a car commuter and an avid cyclist from Guelph and I'm concerned bill 212 will endanger me without leading to any noticeable improvement in congestion. It is not true that eliminating a driving lane in order to free up space for bike lanes causes congestion. I know this because I both drive and bike, during rush hour, on local roads that have already been put on a \"road diet\" to reduce from 4 lanes to 2 lanes + 1 turning lane + 2 bike lanes, and I can tell you there is no slow down or congestion that I can see. Much congestion is caused by left-turning vehicles and  the middle turning lane does a great job at diverting the turners out of the way of the ones going straight. Adding bike lanes, even at the expense of a car lane is a win-win because as a cyclist I get a few feet of space that is vital to my safety and the drivers are motoring right along in their lanes with no slow downs. My own street that I live on has bike lanes and I see many cyclists pass by from my front window even in the winter months. By contrast, without a bike lane I feel nervous, vulnerable and I constantly have to wonder if the driver approaching me from behind is paying attention. After seeing that an elderly Guelph woman was recently killed while riding her bike on a 4 lane road with no bike lanes, bill 212 feels especially upsetting to me. Biking to my grocery store, doctor's office and hair salon has brought me exercise, a noticeable improvement in mental health, fresh air, a social outlet, affordability (my gas bill actually went down!) and a deeper bond with my neighbourhood. I truly believe bill 212 will take these benefits away from me without any tangible benefit to me or my fellow Guelphites.\n"

        "comment": "Last year, I was biking down Front St. outside Union Station during the morning rush hour, and fell off my bike fracturing my arm. Being a road without a bike lane, I was trying to avoid car and cyclist traffic by staying close to the curb, but instead hit the curb and fell onto the sidewalk. It took the fracture 8 months to heal which required multiple hospital visits and greatly impacted my ability to complete day to day activities and as a result my mental health.\nI now only bike on roads with a bike lane, intentionally adding extra time to my commute and leaving streets without bike lanes just for cars. Bike lanes are essential to safety and mobility for me, as biking is my primary mode of transportation, living downtown in an area not well served by the TTC and who cannot afford a car. I encourage you to consider cyclist safety and health care costs of removing bike lanes.\n"
