        "comment": "I am writing regarding the proposed framework requiring provincial approval for municipal bike lanes. This proposal raises significant concerns when evaluated against both the fundamental rights established in the Environmental Bill of Rights (EBR) and the Ministry's Statement of Environmental Values (SEV).\nFundamental Right to a Healthful Environment The EBR, as referenced in your SEV, establishes that \"the people of Ontario have a right to a healthful environment.\" This fundamental right must be understood to encompass our urban environments, where the majority of Ontarians live, work, and move through daily. Consider that:\nUrban environmental health directly impacts human wellbeing through:\nAir quality at street level where people walk and bike\nNoise levels that affect mental and physical health\nSafe spaces for active transportation and community interaction\nAccess to sustainable transportation options\nStreet-level temperatures and urban heat island effects\nOverall quality of life in our communities\nBike lanes contribute substantially to this healthful urban environment by:\nCreating safer streets for all users, including pedestrians\nReducing local air pollution exposure through decreased vehicle traffic\nDecreasing noise pollution that impacts sleep, cardiovascular health, and cognitive development\nEnabling active transportation that improves public health\nBuilding more livable, human-scaled urban environments\nSupporting sustainable urban development patterns\nProviding equitable access to transportation options\nThe proposed framework, by creating barriers to bike lane implementation, risks infringing upon this fundamental right to a healthful environment. The EBR's mandate \"to protect, conserve and where reasonable, restore the integrity of the environment\" must apply to our urban environment where environmental quality directly impacts human health and wellbeing.\nSpecific Concerns with the Proposed Framework\nContradiction of Multi-Modal Transportation Goals Your SEV explicitly commits to \"promoting a multi-modal transportation network, including active transportation.\" Most notably, your SEV specifically recognizes that improving \"public transit and active transportation networks\" helps \"manage congestion and reduce gridlock.\" However, the proposed framework:\nContradicts your own policy position that active transportation helps reduce congestion\nCreates new barriers to implementing active transportation infrastructure that could help manage gridlock\nPrioritizes single-occupancy vehicle traffic over sustainable transportation options that could reduce overall congestion\nUndermines your priority of \"increasing transit ridership\" by making it harder for people to bike to transit stations\nContradicts your commitment to \"promote an integrated transportation system that facilitates the use of public transit, active transportation, and other modes\"\nPlaces an undue burden on municipalities trying to develop integrated transportation networks that could help reduce gridlock\nEnvironmental Assessment Concerns While the proposal states that \"implications to the environment will be considered,\" this approach appears insufficient given your SEV commitments to:\n\"Integrate sustainability into the ministry's decision making, programs, policies and operations\"\n\"Reduce transportation-related air emissions\"\n\"Reduce transportation-related discharges of contaminants to water\"\n\"Support the Government of Ontario's initiatives to conserve energy\"\nThe framework should require comprehensive environmental impact assessments that consider:\nAir quality impacts\nStormwater runoff contamination from increased vehicle traffic, including:\nOil and gasoline leaks\nTire particles and microplastics\nBrake dust and heavy metals\nRoad salt and de-icing chemicals\nSediment and debris\nThe cumulative effect of these contaminants on local watersheds and water quality\nThe relative benefits of bike infrastructure, which produces virtually no water pollution\nClimate Change Obligations Your SEV specifically commits to:\n\"Reduce the impact of Ontario's transportation sector on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions\"\n\"Increase the availability of sustainable modes of travel\"\n\"Support Ontario businesses in developing sustainable new mobility technologies and innovations\" The proposed framework makes it harder to achieve these objectives by creating additional obstacles to sustainable transportation infrastructure.\nEvidence-Based Decision Making The proposal's narrow focus on traffic impacts:\nIgnores your SEV commitment to consider integrated \"social, economic, and scientific considerations\"\nCreates an asymmetric burden of proof that applies only to sustainable transportation infrastructure, where:\nOnly bike lanes must be justified with data\nNo similar requirements exist for car infrastructure\nMunicipalities face extra administrative burdens for sustainable options\nThe default assumption favors car infrastructure without equivalent scrutiny\nOverlooks the comprehensive benefits of bike lanes, including:\nReduced air pollution from decreased vehicle traffic\nSignificantly lower noise pollution, which research has linked to:\nCardiovascular disease\nSleep disturbance\nCognitive impairment in children\nMental health impacts\nReduced property values\nImproved public health outcomes through active transportation\nEnhanced road safety for all users\nEconomic benefits for local businesses and communities, including:\nIncreased retail spending from bike and foot traffic\nHigher property values on calmer, more livable streets\nReduced road maintenance costs\nGreater neighborhood desirability\nMore equitable transportation access\nMunicipal Planning Integration Your SEV emphasizes \"promoting the integration of transportation, land use and environmental planning in decision making.\" However, this framework:\nUndermines municipal authority to implement context-appropriate transportation solutions\nCreates regulatory uncertainty for municipalities planning long-term transportation networks\nMay discourage municipalities from pursuing active transportation projects due to additional bureaucratic requirements\nCould delay implementation of urgent safety improvements\nRecommendations:\nRevise the framework to include comprehensive evaluation criteria that align with your SEV and the EBR's fundamental right to a healthful environment, including:\nEnvironmental benefits (both natural and urban)\nPublic health impacts\nSafety improvements\nEconomic effects on local businesses and communities\nAccessibility enhancements\nClimate change mitigation potential\nIntegration with existing transportation networks\nEnsure the \"specified criteria\" mentioned in the proposal:\nReflect the full range of benefits that bike lanes provide\nConsider both immediate and long-term impacts\nAccount for municipal transportation master plans\nInclude environmental and health metrics\nSupport the achievement of provincial climate targets\nRecognize the value of creating healthful urban environments\nModify the data collection requirements to:\nInclude metrics beyond just traffic flow\nConsider seasonal variations in cycling usage\nAccount for induced demand in both driving and cycling\nMeasure safety improvements and public health outcomes\nEvaluate impacts on community wellbeing and urban environmental health\nI urge the Ministry to align this framework with both its own environmental values and the fundamental right to a healthful environment established in the EBR. The current proposal risks undermining Ontario's progress toward creating healthier, more sustainable, and more equitable communities for all residents.\n"

        "comment": "As a North York driver, it is absolutely ridiculous to remove bike lanes. Bikes are going to be on the road regardless as people need to commute and that\u2019s not solely done by car.  If the dedicated lane for bikes is removed, the bikes will ride on the road. Traffic is only as fast as its slowest participants. So forcing mixed traffic will make traffic worse not better. It also means that as drivers we have to be in conflict with bikes and someone is going to get hurt.\nRipping out bike lanes is a massive overreach, will waste a ton of taxpayer money and will do nothing to decrease congestion.\n"

        "comment": "The removal or the environmental assessment for highways is not acceptable especially when running through important ecological areas. The fact that this was buried in a bill that also looks to take away bike lanes and other important infrastructure is disappointing.  The removal of newly built lanes is a waste of time an money. It also ignores the the safety of those who commute by bike. I live in Toronto and drive in the city, I prefer to drive to on roads with dedicated bike lane because it removes the bike from the flow of traffic.\n"

        "comment": "As a novice/casual cyclist who rides for transportation, the presence of bike lanes is crucial for my ability to get around on my bike. Toronto has made great strides in its cycling infrastructure in recent years, incentivizing myself (and many others) to choose cycling over driving. However, there is much work to do if Toronto wants to be considered a world class city in this regard. Studies have shown \u2014 and cities such as Amsterdam, Paris, London, Copenhagen, and Montreal have demonstrated \u2014 that we can create demand for cycling if we provide the infrastructure, even in cities with cold winters.\nFor each bike on the road, imagine if that cyclist no longer felt safe on their bike and opted to drive instead. Said a different way, each cyclist represents up to one less car on the road. Cycling infrastructure is crucial for reducing gridlock and slows the speed of traffic, ultimately making roads safer for drivers, pedestrians, and cyclists alike.\nIt is time for the province to catch up with the modern world, or at least get out of the city\u2019s way as we incentivize green, active transportation; provide safe transportation options so folks can opt not to drive; and ultimately get more cars off the road to reduce gridlock. Instead of bike lanes, let\u2019s focus on enhancing public transportation and completing long overdue transit projects to provide more options and get more people out of cars.\n"

        "comment": "This comment concerns PART XII MUNICIPAL BY-LAWS AND BICYCLE LANES.\nI would like to express my disagreement with the province's proposed measures to limit the construction of bike lanes in Ontario. Concerns include:\nNecessity\n- The government has failed to provide sufficient evidence that bike lanes meaningfully contribute to traffic congestion in Ontario.\n- The government has failed to provide sufficient evidence that removing bike lanes on highways will meaningfully alleviate traffic congestion in Ontario.\n- The government has failed to provide sufficient evidence that adding to highways will alleviate motor vehicle congestion (i.e., does not consider the phenomenon of induced demand).\n- The government has failed to demonstrate that municipal governments do not already conduct sufficient analyses to determine traffic congestion impacts of bikes on highways that they manage.\n- The government has not articulated how it is better placed than municipal governments to determine what transit modes to prioritize according to the needs of their constituents.\n- The government has not articulated why motor vehicle traffic should be prioritized over othe transit modes.\nProportionality\n- The government appears to be using a handful of bikes lanes in the Greater Toronto Area as pretense to justify its incursion into areas of all municpalities' remit. (I live in Ottawa; we have two short protected bike lanes downtown off of main arteries -- why does Ontario need weigh in on their existance?)\n- The government has not considered why it is targeting bike lanes, but not other infrastructure that that affect motor vehicle traffic on highways, including, inter alia, on-street motor vehicle parking, public transit, and pedestrian infrastructure.\n- The government only requires municipalities to conduct analyses of bicycle lane impacts on traffic congestion, but does not require that the province conduct impact assessments on the removal of bicycle lanes.\nHarm\n- The government has not conducted risk analyses and assessments to determine the potential impacts of its proposed restrictions on bike lanes.\n- Impacts may include, inter alia: environmental harm, increased fatal accidencts, increased injury rates, poorer health outcomes, economic impacts on local businesses, community impacts.\nJustification\nThere are many other concerns Ontarians have with this proposal. Not least, many citizens are frustrated that this Government is turning active transit infrastructure into a political wedge issue. Unfortunately, this Government appears uninterested in addressing the root causes of the traffic congestion, including surban sprawl, lack of safe, effecient multi-modal transit options that force more people into cars, insufficient public transit investment, and an cultural fixation with the automobile. Rather than work to have serious discussions with Ontarians about what the data tells us, the Government has opted to instead offer poor solutions chasing after fictional problems.\n"

They cannot afford cars and cycle to and from work. two of my three sons have had a friend killed while cycling in Toronto.\nWith the cost of housing so high for young people in Toronto, they need to use their bikes for transportation.

        "comment": "In Ottawa, bike lanes on Laurier Ave and Metcalfe have protected cyclists and encouraged an increase in the share of cycling in transportation for the past several years, including pre pandemic.\nThe impacts have been minimal on traffic flow, because these lanes were used for parking outside of rush hour, and blocked by cars stopping for minutes at a time waiting for passengers during rush hour. On Metcalfe, before the bidirectional bike lane was installed, the lane was too narrow to accommodate traffic, thus it sat empty for all but the most courageous/reckless drivers. I was one of them who would navigate it, and saw it as my own personal speedway, but that is not a great excuse to remove the bike lane now.\nMoreover, these lanes connect to other cycling infrastructure. Removing or moving them to side streets would introduce other bottlenecks for cars due to the need to redesign smaller intersections to protect cyclists, reduce the effectiveness of Ottawa's cycling network and reduce cycling's model share of transportation.  All of this would increase traffic congestion.\nI cannot comment on the issues allegedly caused by Toronto bike lanes, but in Ottawa, the impacts of them, if any, are minimal. Please do not refer to Ottawa municipal bike infrastructure as an example to support this legislation.\nIf none of this convinces you, then it doesn't really matter.  Legislation such as this will cause induced demand and increase gridlock to such a degree that traffic will be safer to navigate by bicycle since most cars will be stationary or slow moving. I have lived in cities with pro car policies and in urban centres, traffic congestion has brought traffic to a standstill, without exception.\nCars cause traffic jams, not bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "I drive my car and also ride my bike in Toronto. The reasoning behind removing bike lanes is simply illogical. Is the hope to discourage cyclists from using the roads altogether? If so, I can guarantee that will not happen. It wouldn\u2019t discourage me at all and I\u2019m not a die-hard cyclist by any means.\nThe only thing removing bike lanes will do is make it significantly more dangerous for both cyclists and drivers to get around the city. It will create more traffic and gridlock because there will be far more opportunities for cars to get stuck behind cyclists in a shared lane and not have the space to go around. Or even worse, drivers will try to pass unsafely.\nHaving separate bike lanes makes getting around the city much easier, safer and less stressful as both a driver and cyclist because I know where to expect everyone to be on the road. Aside from this, to think that the money we as tax payers have contributed to bike lane infrastructure would just be thrown out the window is infuriating. All the time, money and resources that have been put into building out the bike lanes completely wasted - what an absolute shame.\n"

        "comment": "This is an egregious waste of taxpayer dollars and well outside the jurisdiction of the provincial government. The people of Toronto voted for the representatives who backed this bike lane and paid for it; it is an affront to democracy to undo acts of other levels of government. Even if this legislation were to pass, it would certainly not be retroactive. The premier clearly has a conflict of interest in this matter as the route he is targeting is on his commute to work. This is also an underhanded way to pass legislation designed to remove requirements for environmental assessments to enable him and his associates to pursue construction projects that will directly benefit him once out of office. I would say that this warrants investigation from the appropriate ethics/integrity adjudicator. I would encourage Doug Ford and his party co-conspirators to do what the rest of us to do have our voices heard and vote in municipal elections, or use his position to advocate rather than enact arbitrary laws based on his whim. I understand that may be an unreasonable expectation however as recognizing that others have value and that you are not special requires adult-level intellectual functioning.\n"

        "comment": "Thank you.\nI'm tired of cities making it harder and more frustrating to drive in order to appease a minority of citizens who do not even use the amenities they call for.\nWhen I lived in downtown Ottawa, I would constantly sit in traffic on O'Connor Street and watch as the new bike lane sat under-used. Some days not a single bike would pass by in the 15 minutes I would be waiting. On weekends, I would watch as cars bottlenecked at the South end of Elgin, unable to turn onto Queen Elizabeth Drive due to it being closed for bike use. You know; the road that runs parallel to one of the nicest dedicated bike paths in the country, and is across the canal from one of the other nicest dedicated bike paths in the country.\nCycling infrastructure is important and cyclists deserve safe passage, but punishing commuters who have no choice but to use their car is not the answer. Especially when they are given no say in the matter.\n"

However the removal of bike lanes and the suspension of installing new bike lanes is not a solution.\nBike lanes remove traffic from congested roads - cycling in the downtown area of Toronto is often a faster, cheaper and healthier transit choice.\nCycle lanes provide a safer path for cyclist to travel and typically fee up a traffic lane for car traffic. Removing cycle lanes will not improve traffic flow, it will create unsafe road conditions for a large number of road users including children.\nStreet cars, buses, car parking, left turns (where no turning lane exists) slow traffic as well, but this proposal will not address\n"

        "comment": "This is a stupid proposal, and wildly unsafe. This proposal essentially says that the province has the right over how a municipal roadway is used, and not the municipality it belongs to. This proposal implies that the province will take ownership of the roads. This will raise provincial taxes. As well, this proposal will actively get cyclists hurt. There are no \"side-street\" alternatives for midtown Yonge and Bloor St West, there are only other arterials that are kilometers away. Why wouldn't the cars take those alternative arterials, since they're in a climate controlled cabin?  The cyclists will still need to ride on Bloor and on Yonge, and the only difference will be that they will have to take the lane to ensure their own safety, forcing car traffic to go around. If cyclists don't take the lane, they will be subject to attempted vehicular assault and manslaughter. The premier and the minister of transport are essentially saying that road safety does not matter to them. Furthermore, the rest of the bill seems to strip away property rights from Ontarians, environmental protections, and further municipal power by overruling bylaws.\nThis is a bad piece of legislature, and I sincerely hope that this is some sort of extended joke. The removal of bike lanes will cost Ontarians hundreds-of-thousands of dollars so that the premier and his ministers can drive to work faster for approximately a year or so before the traffic adjusts to the capacity and becomes overloaded. In the city voted to have the best public transportation in North America. As the regional transit system is being overhauled and upgraded and the local transit is seeing a change in leadership. I, for one, refuse to pay for this as a tax payer and will seek actions to disrupt attempts to remove the bike lanes which I have frequently used for years.\n"
