        "comment": "I gave up having a car more than 11 years ago, after I no longer had kids at home. I live in the West end and bike or walk virtually everywhere, only occasionally taking the TTC. The bike lane infrastructure is so important for safety. The Bloor bike lane is extensively used and has been studied for impact on traffic and local businesses. The statistics on the Bike Share usage in Toronto is extremely encouraging.\nI am very concerned about decision making for local issues being transferred to the province. The old city of Toronto is not Mississauga, Ajax or Richmond Hill - cities built for cars. Most people who live here pay premium rent or property tax for less personal space to have easy access to walkable streets, neighbourhood parks and restaurants, farmer\u2019s markets, theatre, etc. We want less car traffic not more. We want improved public transportation and more cycling infrastructure. We look to Montreal (way worse winters!) and Paris for models to move towards with cycling.\nSome drivers love to gripe about bike lanes, but the data and research doesn\u2019t support them. Many of the traffic problems stem from construction and repair work, which are both constant and poorly coordinated. Toronto is focused on building density - condo towers going up everywhere. Those LOCAL people will mostly be relying on TTC, walking, and biking. We need to improve those options and discourage city car use. Let\u2019s keep the decision making local!\n"

        "comment": "I am a resident of Toronto (growing up in GYA suburbs), car driver (who commutes by car within the city), and recreational cyclist.\nThis bill is short cited, a waste of tax payer money, not efficient, and worst of all does not solve the problem that is the title of this bill.\nRiding a bicycle is dangerous in Toronto on streets without bike lanes. Cyclists have to reside on cycling on roads with moving cars or in a small space between a parked car and moving car traffic. This creates little space to ride safely. Cars can come into the space, parked drivers can open doors and hit cyclists (this happened to me once and I ended up flipped into the air and landing in garbage cans), and pedestrians can walk out of front of bikes. This increases the chances of accidents. And also makes things unsafe for drivers and cyclists.\nI currently commute within the city by car because there is no adequate bike lane infrastructure to get from my home to work. The difference for driving versus cycling is 5 min (45 vs 50 min respectively). The times I have bike have led to some risky rides with cars coming close to clipping me (despite safe and non aggressive riding style). As such I need to drive to be safe. If there were bike lanes and a safe riding commute, I would commute every day and take a car off the road. When I worked downtown, there were plenty of safe routes to take and I would cycle every day.\nThe major issue with traffic in the city is 1) construction blocks major routes and slows everything down. Removing bike lanes just adds more construction and makes things slower. 2) our highways are inadequate for the demand of cars, so more lanes will still lead to more traffic as cars cannot get onto the highway in peak hours. This money would be better spent figuring out solutions to get more cars off the road (bike lanes, transit). Also in the suburbs, it\u2019s the perfect place to add bike lanes and walking lanes along all roads, there is more space and with the infrastructure there will be use.\nThis is not a good bill and a waste of tax payer money. Please be the efficiency party and mandates that you were elected for.\n"

        "comment": "Taking out bike lanes is a bad move\u2014it puts lives at risk and ignores the fact that roads are for everyone, not just cars. Why is the province stepping in here? The city\u2019s supposed to represent what residents actually want, and this decision just hurts cyclists, drivers, and the economy (https://toronto.citynews.ca/video/2024/10/24/annex-businesses-tell-ford\u2026). Instead of ripping up useful infrastructure, maybe the province could get those delayed transit projects done that would help with traffic. It\u2019s honestly frustrating and makes me wonder about the future here, where it feels like everything the province touches gets privatized, defunded, or torn up.\n"

        "comment": "As a resident of Downtown Toronto  I want transit option that work for me. This means that I want bike lanes so I can safely get to work or take my kids to their activities. Driving downtown Toronto is no longer a primary option, we have transit, bicycles and walking. Removing bike lanes endangers commuter lives. It places safety and lives of those in cars above the safety and lives of those riding bicycles.\nRemoval of bike lanes stunts growth of bicycle commuting that we have experienced with the advent of affordable e-bikes. It is a waste of tax payers money and it does not respect the needs of those who live and pay taxes in places like downtown Toronto to have safe and affordable transportation. It is an act of denial by those unwilling to accept that Ontario cities are changing. Toronto is more dense and it needs transport alternatives to cars, something that this government is failing to deliver and this legislation is another example of the complete short sightedness. Places like Toronto do not become unlivable, because cars cannot get around, they become unlivable when governments like this Ontario government fail to accept that the world is changing and there new ways of doing things.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is a huge step backwards in many ways and an extreme disappointment on multiple fronts.\nFirst, the building of Highway 413. The expected benefits are that people will save a significant amount of time travelling on this route. Looking at where the route connects - from the west end of Brampton to the north end of Vaughan, this will not be a popular route. Congestion that exists today won't be fixed by building this highway. Not to mention that building highways generally isn't considered a good way to fix congestion - public transit is. As mentioned on highway413.ca, it's true that the population of the region will continue to grow. It's impossible for everyone to drive a car to get everywhere, as we'll run out of road space for all the cars. Cars are not efficient, bad for the environment, and expensive, and building a highway to allow for more cars will not provide the projected benefits.\nThe second huge disappointment is the addition of removing recently built bike lanes in Toronto. I have personally ridden my bike on these streets due to the addition of the bike lanes. They are a great method of getting around that isn't a car for people who are able to bike. As many studies show, bike lanes do not increase congestion, and provide a much nicer street to walk on when they exist. When streets have too many cars on them, they are loud and not a place people want to be.\nBoth of these endeavours are also huge waste of time and money. The bike lane one is a city issue that should not be in the hands of the Ontario government. The money spent on the highway could be spent on public transit that would improve congestion and many other aspects of Ontarians lives.\nIt's bills like these put forth by the Ontario PC party that would truly make me consider leaving the province, as they will immeasurable long term damage to the province and undo what people have worked so hard for.\n"

I have lived in the Annex near Bloor St for over a decade and am both a driver and a biker. I have driven on Bloor before and after bike lanes and have only seen improvements in car flow and bike flow. These decisions should be left the community who live in the community, see and use the streets. Commuters coming in daily face gridlock as there are many people coming in daily at the same time. Removing a bike lane won't fix car gridlock, and certainly is not a long term solution as Toronto grows and commuters rise. Rush hour happens everywhere. Not only on Bloor St. If you say more cars can fit on Bloor St without a bike lane, where will they be able to rush off to? Will there still be gridlock down Spadina and other major streets where there are currently no bike lanes toward the Gardiner that is backed up? Please consider long term solutions - more public transit and more bike lanes will and have been proven to reduce cars on the road. The Provincial government's consideration for this is deeply disappointing and shocking. They have not provided studies of any benefit, are wasting our money, putting the public in danger and are overstepping the community's decision. Bikers need to use both main streets and side streets to get places in Toronto. Tell me how to get to Union Station on bike without using a major street? Why is the safety of Toronto citizens being taken away who would have to share a lane with a car?\nPlease actually listen to the local community and urban community at large and consider our money, our life and our safety before making these decisions. I don't think the government is naive to the fact that more room for cars does not reduce traffic - I am sure the government is familiar with the many studies, example Cities and planning expert opinions, so as to why all relevant government employees are pushing this ludicrous idea is concerning and questions trust in this government who doesn't appear to be making decisions for public good and benefit.\n"

        "comment": "Take a drive around the city and you\u2019ll realize that the number one driver of congestion in Toronto is construction. The lack of coordinated planning around construction in Toronto is the biggest culprit. Couple that with a transit system that is chronically breaking down and offering reduced service and you have a formula for the extreme traffic slowdowns we witness daily.\nAs a driver, pedestrian and cyclist, I can say that riding my bike reduces the number of potential cars on the road and makes for a healthier commute. We should be promoting both factors. And let\u2019s instead invest money in speeding up construction projects, not creating more inefficiencies by tearing up existing lanes that provide alternate transportation options and ensuring they are safe for our citizens.\nShow some humanity, ingenuity, decency and true problem solving skills. Be a builder not a breaker. That\u2019s what makes for a true community builder and leader who governs for the betterment of society.\n"

        "comment": "As a cyclist in Toronto, I strongly oppose Bill 212, which overlooks crucial safety measures for road users like myself. With cycling becoming a primary mode of transportation for many Torontonians, especially amid growing concerns over environmental impact and traffic congestion, it\u2019s essential that our laws reflect this shift. Unfortunately, Bill 212 misses the mark on ensuring safer infrastructure and enforcement that protects cyclists.\nWe need more than just painted lanes and temporary solutions. Bill 212 should incorporate clear provisions for protected bike lanes, stricter enforcement against aggressive driving, and better intersection designs to prevent the alarming number of accidents that involve cyclists. Without these measures, this bill risks pushing us further from safe, accessible streets, discouraging cycling at a time when we should be promoting it as a sustainable and viable option.\nPlease reconsider Bill 212\u2019s scope and prioritize the safety and well-being of all road users\u2014especially the most vulnerable. Toronto\u2019s cyclists deserve legislation that values their lives and supports a vision for safer, more inclusive streets.\n"
