        "comment": "As a resident of a major city that has a significant problem with fatalities of cyclists, I do not think that the province should be interfering with a city's implementation of bike lanes.\nIf the province wants to help traffic in major cities then the province should be investing in local public transportation, reliable and fast intercity rail, and the development of affordable housing in city centers. Removing bike infrastructure is a waste of taxpayer dollars, and unless the province wants to do studies on where bike lanes should be installed (and foot the bill), the province should not have veto power on municipal issues.\nFurthermore, to include components that seek to remove environmental assessments to expedite the 413 highway, which studies have shown will not reduce gridlock in Ontario, shows that this bill is more about enabling corruption and interference in municipal matters than helping Ontario.\n"

Why should we be making decisions for Toronto to make the lives of those who drive through Toronto easier?  Decisions for the community should be made by that community.   Should we get a government that is pro bike lanes, should they be able to force those bike lanes in places like Fergus and thunderbay?   No.   Those local decisions should be made by locals.  Not by some fat politician who is incapable of riding a bike.   Communities should govern themselves.\n"

        "comment": "The premise for this proposal is not helpful to the problem it seeks to eliminate.\nMore lanes of traffic produce more congestion.\nEven if they did not, at face value this slows down already slow municipal government bodies by requiring an additional person to approve something.\nWhy is the Provincial government trying to be the mayor of all towns and cities?  Allow elected officials to do their jobs.\nPeople see the inaction on the important subjects, matters like these are attempting to be a distraction or are seriously misguided and misunderstood matters for the Provincial government to undertake.\n"

If we keep bike lanes, it promotes more people to BIKE. Which in turn reduces bike lanes.\nI will feel UNSAFE without bike lanes. This is a waste of money.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes will not alleviate traffic congestion; instead, it could exacerbate the problem. Bike lanes provide a safe and efficient alternative for commuting, reducing the number of cars on the road. When people have access to safe biking infrastructure, they are more likely to choose cycling over driving, which directly reduces vehicle traffic. By removing these lanes, we force more individuals back into cars, further increasing congestion, pollution, and strain on existing roadways. Maintaining bike lanes is a cost-effective way to support sustainable transportation, improve overall traffic flow, and contribute to a cleaner environment.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is a terrible idea for so many reasons. Not only does it constitute gross government overreach but it won't even do anything to improve drive times. Having a safe bike lane in the neighbourhood means people will take trips by bike instead of by car thereby reducing the number of cars on the road. I thought the conservative party was in favour of cutting red tape, not adding unnecessary layers of bureaucratic approvals. This proposal is so embarrassing and makes conservatives look like fools and hypocrites. Leave municipal decisions up to the municipalities!\n"

        "comment": "This has to be the biggest overreach into municipal politics ever. also the stupidest idea ever.\nBike lanes promote green commuting and save lives. They reduce the number of cars on the road and replace them with bikes. Few bike lanes means fewer cyclist which means more cars which means more traffic congestion.\nDoug ford has come up with some pretty dumb ideas but this is by far the dumbest and most dangerous of them all.\n"

There is research done in many cities across the world, including New York, Paris, Vancouver, and Montreal, that shows bike lanes have reduced traffic congestion. Bike lane projects also increase the number of customers to businesses along these bike lanes and are supported by business owners.\n"

        "comment": "At a time when inequality is on the rise throughout the province and nature's capacity to absorb greenhouse gases (GHGs) is rapidly diminishing (Oxford University Press, 2024), we must prioritize solutions that reduce traffic density and ensure affordable transportation for all. This bill threatens to exacerbate the province's carbon footprint, deepen social inequities, and increase commuting times for everyone.\nFurthermore, with no significant plans to transition to a cleaner electric grid over the next 10\u201315 years, and several nuclear plants scheduled for maintenance, electric vehicles (EVs) will not offer a viable solution to this crisis in the short term.\nThis bill also contravenes critical legal frameworks, including:\nThe Human Right of Mobility;\nThe Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change;\nOntario\u2019s Provincial Policy Statement (PPS, 2020);\nThe Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe (2020);\nThe Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program;\nThe Canadian Environmental Protection Act (CEPA);\nCanada's Net-Zero Emissions by 2050 Plan;\nThe Paris Agreement;\nUnited Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDG) 11 and 13.\nBy limiting people's capacity to move freely\u2014regardless of income, background, or ethnicity\u2014this bill undermines basic human rights. It also stalls progress on numerous international and domestic commitments to address climate change and social equity.\nNothing gets me more uneven, stressed and awake at night more than what this proposal represents: a step backward. I am deeply concerned that it will lead to a future where environmental, economic, and social conditions worsen for everyone. We must move forward together toward a more sustainable and equitable province. Canada already made 1.6 times more GHG emissions above usual because of the wildfires. Let's work to assure our survival as a species.\n"

Why are we fighting to make this more difficult?\nThis is such an obscene and disgusting piece of legislature that I'm confident that this is a culture war wedge specifically designed to distract from the highway expedition piece.\n"

        "comment": "As a voter who does not have a driver\u2019s license, who rides their bike around the city - out through Etobicoke where I have worked with kids in Driftwood and Albion Heights, bike lanes save me time. They are faster and more direct than our transit system. They are safer than biking on various roads. where I have had more near misses with transport trucks merging into the shoulder to get on to the 427.\nBike lanes give my daughter freedom to get around our neighbourhood - to see friends and get to school safely, to go to the movie theatre. They are an environmental health protection tool; a child is more likely to be killed by a car than be abducted by a stranger. Our priorities are misplaced.\nIf the government proceeds with this bill, there will blood on their hands, plain and simple.\n"

Adding \"one more lane\" has never worked historically.\nPlease focus on matters that have a much bigger impact on Ontarians like our massively underfunded education and heathcare systems.\nMore Ontarians now then ever are living paycheck to paycheck and removing bike lanes is a non issue that distracts from more important critical issues.\nPlease reconsider as this is a massive waste of time and money.\nThank you.\n"

Those who don\u2019t have access to a car will now bike in the street, endangering their lives and slowing down the traffic that cannot easily pass them.\nFocus on public transit and enforcement of those who cause significant traffic issues like those who enter intersections despite not being able to make it through and then block traffic.\nIt is unbelievable that with all the issues causing traffic that the government has chosen cyclists; those doing their part to alleviate the traffic by keeping their cars off the road, stay healthy and reduce emissions, have become the scapegoat for the issue.\n"
