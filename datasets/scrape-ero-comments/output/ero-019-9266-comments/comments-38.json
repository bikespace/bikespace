Removing and hindering bike lanes is only going to increase car commuting and add to greenhouse gas emissions. As an Ontarian, I am embarrassed by this antiquated approach to traffic management.\n"

The only way to relieve congestion is to get people out of their cars (not only through better cycling facilities, but also through more intense neighbourhoods close to where people work, more remote work, and better transit). Please rethink this ill-considered legislation.\n"

I don\u2019t do this for ideological reasons, but rather because it is often the quickest way to get around. I am able to do this because the bike lanes that have been built make me feel safe enough to bike. Without bike lanes I would drive for more of my trips and contribute to worsening traffic. Please reconsider this legislation, people will die if you remove bike lanes and it won\u2019t even reduce traffic. The lanes will just be used as street parking and more cars on the road mean worse traffic.\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nYour decision to remove bike lanes from city streets will take Ontario backwards while other cities are moving forwards.  Young professionals (especially health conscious ones like doctors and nurses) are choosing cities that are vibrant, walkable, and bikeable.  No one chooses a place to live based on how fast traffic can move on city streets.   Other more world class cities are laughing at you and ridiculing your choices.\nRemoving bike lanes and replacing them with car lanes will induce demand for driving and make commute times worse and worse.\nIn addition bike lanes keep cyclists alive.  Removing them will mean the most vulnerable road users including children will die at higher rates on Ontario roads.\nYour costly decision to do this will not get you elected.  It is not supported by young professionals, by families with children, by commuters who understand how induced demand work, or by anyone who walks, wheels, or bikes in Ontario.  This will cost you the next provincial election.\nSincerely,\nAn anonymous middle aged driver\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes do not create more traffic for cars - cars do.\nI support creating more bike lanes and protecting existing ones. I do not support preventing bike infrastructure from being made in order to create more car infrastructure. There is congestion on the roads because Toronto is a populous city that has become more car-dependent post-pandemic. If there were better public transit and biking infrastructure (better as in more safe, accessible, affordable, and widespread), THAT is what would reduce car congestion.\nThis bill sucks and is not in the best interest of the people.\n"

        "comment": "In my humble opinion, this new proposal is a big mistake for many, MANY reasons.\nSafety - Bike lanes improve safety for pedestrians and those who need/choose to bike - Bike lanes provide a safe buffer between vehicle lanes and the sidewalk, which improves safety and comfort for anyone walking (children, seniors, and everyone else).\nBike lanes actually improve safety for motorists - Many areas (especially smaller towns) have excessive amounts of road space. It's a proven fact that as lanes/roads get wider, traffic speeds increase. Where there is excessive space on the road the road space should be reduced to calm driving behaviours. This improves safety for all users, including motorists. Prioritizing vehicle speeds and space over safety will result in more dangerous collisions, car crashes, fatalities, all while increasing congestion.\nSafety - There is (and will continue to be) an increase in other active modes, which can be accommodated in bike lanes - Scooters, skateboards, etc., are used in bike lanes. By limiting the number of bike lanes, the province would also be indirectly forcing these users to either be on the road or sidewalks (most likely they would choose sidewalks, which increases the risks to pedestrians).\nEquity - Favouring vehicle lanes over other modes of transportation leaves some people with little or no transportation at all - kids, young teenagers, newcomers to Canada (who don't have licenses yet), people who can't afford cars/gas, and anyone who has medical issues which makes them unable to drive are more affected than others.\nHealth / Safety - Vehicle lanes should NOT be the priority - Active modes (cycling, skateboards, scooters, walking, etc.) should be the priority as they keep people healthy and reduce the risk of fatal or major injury collisions.\nDuplication - The policy would overstep boundaries - Many of the larger municipalities already have frameworks for decision-making, including multimodal Level of Service guidelines. There are already frameworks in place for making informed, well-thought-out decisions at the municipal level, so why would the province feel a need to overrule these existing policies?\nLocal context - The decision-makers would have little to no knowledge of local context - The policy seems to be written specifically for the GTA, not for other regions of the province. There are many factors to consider when making these high-level decisions, and it seems like an awful idea to have some bureaucrat in the GTA decide what is best for other municipalities that they may have never even stepped foot in.\nCost Duplication - The policy would be costly - Taxpayers are already paying for engineering studies, etc. at the municipal level. Why should we also be paying for someone at the provincial level (living in the GTA) to review the same engineering studies that municipal engineers are already reviewing?\nEconomy - The policy would impact the economy - Adding barriers to construction would slow or halt many municipal construction projects. If the province were to disallow safety improvements such as these, that would be millions of dollars of lost opportunity for the engineering/design and construction industries.\nCycling convenience - Moving bike lanes to side streets is not the answer - There are several reasons for this (many destinations are on the main streets, often main streets are the more direct/less complicated path, often main streets are longer than side streets, often these side streets do not have traffic signals when they cross main roads, etc.).\nCongestion/Safety - Some cyclists will just move to the general traffic lanes if there aren't bike lanes - I can't see why the premier would think that it's a bad idea to have safe facilities for cyclists, rather than have them in the general traffic lane. If I were cycling and my choices were the general traffic lanes of the main street or a circuitous route along a side street, I would choose the general traffic lane.\nCongestion - Other cyclists will choose to drive instead of biking/skateboarding/scootering - Bike lanes are added to streets to help offer an alternative to driving. In some cases, if a cyclist chooses to bike to their destination, that's one less car on the road. Reducing the number of bike lanes (or making them inconveniently located on side streets), would increase the number of cars, which would increase congestion, and subsequently increase response times for emergency vehicles.\nOptics - The policy would be regressive and would put Ontario on the map for being a car-dependent bureaucracy rather than being progressive and forward-thinking - Many jurisdictions are working on their vision zero policies and aiming to make transportation more equitable, accessible and safer. This policy would be entirely backwards. We should be making things better, not worse.\n"

        "comment": "As a citizen of Ontario and Registered Dietitian, I urge you, please do not rip up our bike lanes.\nThere are many stats as to why this will not help traffic congestion (please see link attached), but I would also like to share my personal story to help the stats come to life.\nI work in a hospital in downtown Toronto and commute every day by bicycle.  With housing prices as they are, I cannot afford a car and parking. Cycling to work is faster than taking TTC for me!\nI have been bicycle commuting for over 10 years and can tell you 100% that the Bloor bike lanes, including on Bloor St West, have increased my safety on the road, and also increased the number of co-cyclists I see every day alongside me.  They have also made me comfortable using a bicycle as transportation with my 2 year old daughter as well.\nI am deeply concerned about daughter's future with global warming.  Bicycles are one way that we can do a little more to mitigate the negative effects of pollution.\nAs a Registered Dietitian, we also learned in our public health class that we need to \"make the healthy choice the easy choice.\"  By having bike lanes on roads that help us feel safe cycling and give us an efficient route to key locations, we are promoting this.  My heart is also warmed to see more and more senior citizens and families travelling by bicycle: e-bikes in particular are making cycling more accessible to the masses and are gradually becoming more affordable.\nI used to take the winters off cycling, but being pregnant during the peak pandemic kept me on my bike a full winter as I wanted to avoid close contacts on the TTC (and my pregnancy related nausea made stuffy bus rides hard).  This opened my eyes that cycling throughout the winter IS very doable and enjoyable -- there are many many days where the bike lanes are clean and dry, and with the right outerwear it is no problem.  I am seeing more and more cyclists through winter now too -- and Scandinavian countries are definitely a good model for this, where 80-85% of cyclists continue throughout winter!\nI'd also like to add the I cycle several km on Bloor St in Toronto every day during rush hour on my commute-- and traffic is not bad at all.  Cars are moving along; the odd place they are bunched up it is when they are waiting for a red light to turn green and then the road ahead has already cleared.  It is construction projects where I've seen the traffic jams lie.  Ripping out bike lanes would mean more construction!  It would also pain me to see the financial investment of bike lanes lost, and tax money wasted removing them.\nIn summary, I beg you to NOT remove existing roads, and let cities who know their communities best make decisions about existing bike lanes.  Please, instead invest the time, resources, energy into improving public transit.\nI can honestly say bike lanes have changed my life for the better by getting me to work faster than the TTC can, improving my physical and mental health, and knowing that I am helping to minimize the effects of climate change for my daughter's future.  And I am not alone- every day I am in good company of many other cyclists.  Sometimes I count the cars and the bikes at a red light and there are more bikes!\nRemoving bike lanes will not remove cyclists-- we will not go back, cycling and public transportation are the future -- but will only increase traffic by slowing cars down to go around us, all whilst putting us at risk of harm or death.\nPlease, please think about safety and the environment.  Please, focus on improving public transportation, not removing bike lanes.\nTo quote Doug Ford himself from TVO's \"Political Blind Date\" in 2017:\n \"We have to do everything we can to make sure there\u2019s never a death in the city. One death is way too many when it comes to bicycle riders. We have to make sure that they\u2019re safe.\"\n"

The city is also capable of assessing appropriate bike lanes and I am against restrictions on them.\n"
