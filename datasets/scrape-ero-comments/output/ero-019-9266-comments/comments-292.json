        "comment": "Hi, I'm a research scientist at a biotech startup located on University avenue and I use the University bike lanes daily during my commute. The bike lanes allow me to commute faster and safer in an eco-friendly fashion.\nIn addition to myself, the University avenue bike lanes are used by the brightest and most dedicated scientists in Canada, who help drive forward the biomedical innovations that benefit all Canadians. Besides our scientists, these lanes are also used by our frontline healthcare workers who provide world class medicine to our sick and vulnerable.\nRemoval of these bike lanes will significantly affect the commute and well-being of our Canadian scientists and healthcare workers. The absence of these bike lanes will ultimately strangle our innovation pipelines, and weaken the quality of care we receive.\n"

Reversing course on advancing the ability for a growing population to move around the city without requiring more cars is a disgusting act of ignorance.\nBeyond the greenbelt scam, the Ontario place farce and all the dispicable things this party has done, removing bike lanes and destroying the positive good they bring to the city is a slap in the face to voters and the tax payers.\nDO NOT REMOVE THE ABILITY FOR ALTERNATE MODES OF TRANSPORT.\nTHINK FORWARDS. NOT BACKWARDS.\n"

        "comment": "New bike lanes should absolutely stay where they are, at least for several years to have reliable usage data. I have recently started to bike to commute, because bike lanes make me feel it is safe enough to bike during busy morning hours.\nIf they want to address congestion, the province should get the transit system right by completing the LRT lines that are long overdue. They will certainly help improve congestion by encouraging people to take transit rather than driving. The province should stay out of the bike lane matters at least until they deliver what is properly their responsibility to reduce congestion (transit).\n"

        "comment": "\"We have to do everything we can to make sure there\u2019s never a death in the city. One death is way too many when it comes to bicycle riders. We have to make sure that they\u2019re safe.\"\nThat was the Premier back in 2017 on TVO's Political Blind Date. \u201cYou\u2019re nervous when there\u2019s no bike lanes. At least I was,\u201d he said. And I agree.\nI am deeply concerned about rumoured provincial legislation leaked in a CBC report back on September 19th that would limit building new (and possibly remove existing) bike lanes. This represents a massive overreach that would effectively limit the toolkit my municipal government has to address issues that are important to me like cleaner air, eliminating serious injuries and fatalities from traffic collisions, and even tackling gridlock and congestion woes. That the Premier, the Minister of Transportation, and the Minister of Infrastructure have all refused to deny this is being actively considered is extremely unsettling.\nMunicipal governments have the local knowledge and contextual understanding necessary to effectively address specific community transportation needs. Any provincial legislation that would limit municipalities from serving their communities ultimately undermines local governance and the ability of municipalities to protect the well-being of their residents. All levels of government have a clear public health obligation to ensure roadways are safe for all users.\nFrom a recent Ipsos poll commissioned by the Toronto Region Board of Trade, 86% of respondents agree that there is a traffic and congestion crisis in the region. But when asked about the causes of congestion, folks can plainly see what\u2019s right in front of them: 68% say too much construction and mismanagement of construction schedules, and 57% say too many cars and trucks on the road. Only 21% say the main reason for traffic congestion is due to \u201cother on-street uses (e.g. bike lanes, parking, CafeTO)\u201d. To be clear, that\u2019s not even 21% blaming just bike lanes. That number includes concerns about on-street parking and business-boosting initiatives like streetside patios and cafes. Even with bike lanes consistently and without evidence being scapegoated, the majority of folks refuse to take the bait.\nI urge you to reject making my safety (and my loved ones\u2019 safety) a pawn in a larger culture war. Riding a bike is not a left-right issue. In Toronto alone, six people have been killed riding their bikes so far this year\u2013more than the previous three years combined. The timing of this all is deeply invalidating to everyone who has lost a friend or family member in a traffic collision. Bike lanes save lives. Not every trip will be bikeable, and not every person will choose to ride a bike. But let\u2019s use evidence-based solutions to keep people moving across the province, and not take away the democratic voices of my municipal leaders and my community.\n"

        "comment": "I disagree with this entirely. The bike lanes reduce accidents and provide an alternative mode of travel for residents. This is clearly an attempt to garner support from the suburbs. Toronto residents want to keep these lanes. Hospitals wanted the lanes on University to improve commutes for their staff. Also, have fun sharing the lane with 100s of delivery workers.\n"

In addition, why are we removing these bike lanes when it is clearly reducing congestion?\nThe government of Ontario should be spending it's time focusing on figuring out why every public project it attempts to push is massively over budget and has no accountability, maybe focus on Metrolinx and the fact that the Eglinton crosstown is almost a decade overdue with no government oversight\nThis is absolutely disappointing of a government with a majority power that should be for small government but is instead poking their nose in this stuff\n"

        "comment": "This bill goes against all facts and science on solving congestion. The only proven way to reduce traffic congestion is viable alternatives to driving, and effective bike lanes are part of that solution. Removing bike lanes and encourage more people to drive will make congestions much worse. If bike lanes were the problem, surely there wouldn't be any congestion on Highway 401 as there is not a single bike lane there. If anything, this bill will make congestion worse for Toronto. Our future generations will look back at us with disgust and contempt for missing all the opportunities to make our cities better places for its residents.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes does not reduce congestion nor solve gridlock. Separated bike lanes ensures safety and predictability of ALL road users. They also stimulate economic activity for local businesses and another option to move throughout the city.\nBikes are environmentally friendly, supports personal health and wellbeing and also happens to be a mode of transportation. Having bike lanes accessible lets cyclists come into the city in a way that is safe to spend money at local businesses and by having them separated from car traffic, ensures their safety and also the safety of drivers as it will reduce the risk of accidents by unpredictable behaviour.\nRemoving the existing bike lanes will be costly, inefficient and will not materially impact the current traffic situation within downtown Toronto. As a resident of this city for the past 20 years, the expansion of bike lanes has made roads safer and better for everyone: pedestrians, drivers, transit operators and cyclists.\n"

Its main purpose is not to shuttle traffic to and from the suburbs.  It should not be the subject of provincial abuse, let alone oversight.  Should the province approve every parking spot?  It should not.\nThe province and city each have roles.  The province should do a good job on its portfolio and not a bad job on someone else's.  Those lanes are more important to good government than the ones on the road.\n"
