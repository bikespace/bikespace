        "comment": "To Katerina Downard,\nI am writing to express my objection to Bill 212 - Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024, specifically regarding the framework that would require the removal of traffic lanes for bike lanes. Reducing bike lane infrastructure would be a significant step backward for our urban development goals and overall community well-being.\nBike Lanes Alleviate Traffic: Evidence shows that bike lanes help mitigate car traffic by encouraging a modal shift from cars to bicycles, thereby reducing congestion. In Montreal, the Express Bike Network (EBN) has demonstrated clear traffic benefits by improving access to key downtown areas and allowing safer street sharing among cyclists, pedestrians, and cars. This infrastructure promotes smoother traffic flow, helping reduce overall congestion on the roads. In Seville, Spain, the introduction of an 80-mile bike network resulted in biking rising from 0.6% to 7% of all trips within six years. This shift not only reduces traffic but also lowers the need for car-related infrastructure.\nHealth Benefits and Inclusivity: Bike lanes also provide substantial public health benefits. They promote physical activity, which is critical in combating health issues like obesity and cardiovascular disease. Further, bike lanes are an inclusive solution, providing mobility options for those who cannot drive\u2014whether due to disabilities, age, or financial constraints. In Montreal, the introduction of safe, protected bike lanes has been particularly successful in attracting a diverse range of cyclists, including those who may not have otherwise used bikes for transportation.\nEnvironmental Impact and Urban Revitalization: Moreover, bike lanes play a key role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to cities\u2019 climate goals. Montreal\u2019s EBN, with its extensive and safe bike paths, supports the city\u2019s broader sustainability objectives by fostering greener transportation options. Additionally, research from Montreal shows that bike lanes can revitalize urban spaces by increasing foot traffic to local businesses and improving neighborhood livability\nRemoving bike lanes would be a regressive move, undermining efforts to create multi-modal transportation networks that accommodate all residents. Instead, preserving and expanding bike lanes will lead to a more inclusive, healthier, and sustainable urban environment.\n"

        "comment": "The provincial government SHOULD NOT be involved in municipal decisions regarding bike lanes. Road infrastructure in Toronto is completely different than road infrastructure say, in Woodstock. We need more access to safe bike infrastructure, and cater less to vehicles. Get rid of street parking on major throughways and maybe that will help the gridlock. Maybe tackle how expensive it is to live in the city and people wouldn\u2019t need to drive in every day. Stop funding the police and put that money into making public transit better. Making the city less bicycle friendly is only making the traffic situation worse not better.\n"

        "comment": "I do not support the exemption from the Environmental Assessment Act for or related to Highway 413.\nThe area where the highway is intended to be built is environmentally sensitive land. Once paved over, that land is lost as a carbon sink, a natural habitat for native flora and fauna, and as a floodplain/natural flood control measure\u2014forever.\nThis is yet another short-sighted policy that will result in disastrous outcomes for the environment.\nIn regards to bike lanes, installation of bike lanes also have the added advantage of making the entire streetscape safer to use for all mobility modes; cars, bikes, pedestrians, and all others. Their existence can save the lives of cyclists and many others.\nSix cyclists have died on Toronto streets this year, and that is six too many; innocent lives lost because the victims were trying to get across town. Utterly senseless, with families shattered as a result.\nI reject Bill 212 entirely.\n"

        "comment": "This is terrible legislation. Removing existing bike lines is a waste of money. It is also an overreach of provincial power.\nData proves that the number of cars on the road must be reduced to reduce gridlock. Alternative methods of transportation, such as public transit and bike lanes, work. Therefore, improve public transit, keep the bike lanes and make more safe bike lanes.\nAlso, change zoning laws to allow for more mixed-use neighbourhoods so more people can live close to where they work so they do not have to commute, or at the very least, live close to shops and services so they can access the majority of what they need either without a car or with a very short drive.\nInstead of wasting money removing bike lanes, Ontario desperately needs healthcare and education improved.\nAlso, exempting 413 lands from environmental assessments is another short-sighted policy that will result in disastrous effects on the natural environment. The land where the highway is intended to be built is environmentally sensitive. Once paved over, that land is forever lost as a carbon sink, a natural habitat for native flora and fauna, and as a floodplain/natural flood control measure. The proposal that this highway should be exempted from any environmental assessment to expedite development suggests the government doesn\u2019t care whatsoever about the environment and, again, is not serious about eliminating gridlock: as mentioned above, the concept of induced demand means that on completion, it will create more gridlock and spew more harmful greenhouses gas emissions into the atmosphere.\n"

How is it ok to actively discriminate and further disadvantage multiple demographics by further impeding their ability to get around the city? Why does the provincial government continue to screw over those with disabilities, marginalized communities, those of low SES. The government is supposed to be for the people not actively trying to kill them. The bike lanes are much needed improvement. They help keep people safe and allow people more options to get around the city.\nTHE BIKE LANES NEED TO STAY.\n"

        "comment": "Bloor is the backbone of downtown Toronto's transportation network. It should accomodate all transportation modes (cars, public transit AND bikes).\nEast-west thoroughfares are hard to come by in this city. The fact that every block was built up independently means minor streets are almost all disjointed and don't run for long stretches. This city's design is practically begging us to move towards the \"15 minute city\" concept. These streets will always struggle to accommodate our population's transportation needs if we don't reduce the need to travel long distances.\nThe best thing we can do to reduce congestion is to continue building transit lines (genuinely huge kudos to all the progress being made there) but also to find ways to reduce the frequency and distance of car trips.\n"

There is complete lack of rationale to remove existing bike lanes along with installation of future ones.\nMunicipalities have publicly endorsed master transportation plans and the province is overstepping its reach.\nFurther reducing the Ea for the needed highway 413 is in detriment of the public interest. Staffs professions ethics need to be followed and adhered to by decision makers.\nHas anyone in MTO heard of induced demand? Creating bike lanes that are seperated will support reduction of congestion.\nThis is a poor decision by the cons.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my deep concern and opposition to Section XII of the Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024. The provision that would require municipalities to seek provincial approval to construct or maintain bike lanes, particularly when they replace motor vehicle lanes, undermines the autonomy of municipalities like Toronto to make critical infrastructure decisions that prioritize safety, sustainability, and quality of life.\nBike lanes serve as vital infrastructure that protect cyclists from motor vehicle accidents, reduce congestion, and encourage environmentally friendly commuting options. The removal of bike lanes or the limitation of municipalities' ability to create new ones is a step backward in promoting road safety and reducing our carbon footprint. Protected bike lanes were designed to safeguard vulnerable road users, and stripping municipalities of the ability to manage their own streets will put countless lives at risk.\nMoreover, allowing the Ministry to reject or review bike lane projects based on traffic flow, rather than safety and sustainability concerns, sends a clear message that the convenience of cars is being prioritized over the safety of cyclists and pedestrians. This bill appears to promote car dependency, which contradicts the goals of reducing traffic congestion and environmental impact.\nI strongly urge the government to reconsider these changes, particularly in urban centers like Toronto where cycling infrastructure is critical to managing traffic and supporting sustainable transportation options.\nPlease reconsider Section XII, and allow municipalities to retain the authority to manage their own bike lanes without interference from the province.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is a bad idea for several reasons.\nFirst, it seems like an over-reach of the provincial government into municipal jurisdiction, and one that would set a bad precedent.\nSecond, removing bike lanes will make it unsafe for cyclists and does nothing to help the environment. Bike lanes encourage people to ride their bikes to work, rather than taking their car, because they provide a safer way to travel by bike. Bikes produce zero emissions compared to cars. We should be encouraging and supporting people who commute by bike. Moreover, many delivery companies such as UberEats, etc. use cyclists in cities to deliver goods. Bike lanes make cycling safer for employees of these delivery companies. Removing bike lanes will be hazardous to these workers.\nThird, provincial government time and money would be MUCH better spent on completing and improving alternative modes of transportation like light rail (e.g. finally finishing the LRT along Eglinton).\nThe bottom line is, if you want to decrease grid lock, then you need to get people out of their cars and into public transportation and bikes. People commute in their cars for convenience, yes, but also because there is no better alternative in many cases. Ask many car commuters and they will tell you that they would happily take a light rail, commuter train, bus, subway, etc if only these options were more frequent, more reliable, and had better coverage.\n"

        "comment": "I am supportive of some items in this Bill. Particularly, requiring provincial approval for bicycle lanes that remove a roadway lane promotes driving over active transportation, causing more gridlock. Additionally, requiring provincial approval will lengthen construction and building processes, which I thought was the direction the provincial government was heading, this seems to contradict other Bills. Additionally, requiring less environmental studies to build highways is extremely harmful, and a massive risk that should not be taken in 2024! Why doesn\u2019t the provincial government invest more in alternate transportation such as high speed rail, and make taking more sustainable, higher capacity transit a more attractive option. This is what will reduce gridlock, not building more lanes and highways. The more you build, the more traffic will use these roads, creating a never ending cycle unless investment is made in higher order transit. Please give Ontarians options for transportation and please stop forcing driving upon the public by only investing in vehicular infrastructure.\n"

It does not pollute the environment and gives me an opportunity for physical activity, which keeps me healthy.  I ride in bike lanes because they provide a level of safety. I am a parent of 2 and am middle-aged.  The activity I get from riding my bike has kept me from getting heart disease and type 2 diabetes, which makes me less of a burden on the healthcare system.  I\u2019m almost 50 and don\u2019t need any medications to manage my health.  This is not something everyone can say.\nYou should know that I was almost hit twice last week on roads without bike lanes.\nI suppose if they get taken out then my best option for safety would be to occupy the middle of a lane, as it would be the only place for me to be.  I think that could cause further congestion but if there\u2019s only one lane then that\u2019s where I should be.\nThanks for giving me the right to the road.  I only had 5% before (% of the road a bike lane occupies), but now I will have 100% of a lane of traffic.  This will absolutely make things safer.\nThank you for looking out for all the parents who want clean air for their children and grandchildren and for gig workers who use bikes to deliver us food when we get hungry.  We will enjoy the space!  You don\u2019t have to worry about getting doored when you are in the middle of the lane.  What a relief.\n"

        "comment": "Taking away bike lanes is counter intuitive to the goal that is trying to be reached. By dedicating the lanes to cars it makes active transportation impossible and more dangerous. Cities should be focusing on solutions to allow people to have access to more space and time efficient solutions instead of forcing everyone to drive. By taking away these cycling lanes, people who would potentially bike are disincentivized due to the dangers.\nHaving protected bike infrastructure along major arteries will be incentivising users, having it on side streets will lead to half baked cycling solutions where it isn't efficient at all to use. The focus should be on creating seperated, safe and well thought out solutions which promotes the average person to cycle instead of taking a car. The more people taking transit / cycle to their destination means there is less people on the roads. This allows the people who need to be on the road to complete their trip with less traffic. Cities should prioritise people, not cars.\n"

It seems like a waste of money and time, where it would instead make more sense to provide cities with guidance on how to best gauge whether biking infrastructure is right for them, how to standardize their biking infrastructure, etc. It especially doesn't make sense to make considerations on tearing out biking infrastructure that's already been put in place.\nIn addition, the decision to lump in legislation on highway construction alongside biking infrastructure feels like a masked way to sneak through construction without environmental concern or respecting the correct processes. As an average Ontario citizen who's lived here my whole life, it's pained me to see the Premier put so much effort suddenly into these projects, meanwhile train service across southern Ontario is still progressing as slowly as ever, as are the subway infrastructure efforts. We need to continue to focus on efforts that will truly address congestion and transportation issues which is to give Ontarians alternate transportation options, not build more highways.\nBest regards.\n"
