        "comment": "Try to make the commuting faster, safer and easier. Not the opposite.\nRiding a bike is the best way to commute around the city. It is fast because it avoids traffic. It is easy with the growing infrastructure like bike share services and bike lanes. And it is safe only if we have sufficient bike lanes. By removing the bike lanes, you are only making it harder and more dangerous than ever for thr residents to commute.\nIf you want to solve the traffic, improve the subway system and increase infrastructures for bike riders. This way people will be encouraged to use the optimal and environmentally friendly solutions. Do not make it harder for people to live.\n"

        "comment": "This proposed legislation is a clear misuse of resources. Research demonstrates robustly that bike lines do not increase congestion. Multiple studies cited and summarized in this CBC article (https://www.cbc.ca/news/science/bike-lanes-impacts-1.7358319) confirm this. Furthermore, they are a key element in decreasing reliance on fossil fuels and reaching climate target goals to provide a safe and sustainable future for everyone, both in Toronto and cities across the province. Spending resources on removing already established lanes makes no sense given the vast needs of our transport systems across the province. I live in Ottawa, and it is astonishing how poorly OC Transpo functions. Rather than wasting resources ripping up established lanes (which would also make traffic worse during the construction,  which is what the legislation allegedly intends to correct, despite there being no evidence that bike lanes contribute to worse traffic), those resources could be allocated to improving public transit in cities across the province.\nComments by Premier Ford make it clear that this is a personal vendetta rather than anything based in research or actually improving the lives of Ontarians. From the CBC (https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ont-bike-lanes-1.7369898) he has reportedly \"complained about some bike lanes creating gridlock, in particular a stretch of Bloor Street West that is about a 10-minute drive from his home in Toronto's west end.\"\nFurther increasing our reliance on highways and fossil fuels, rather than investing in green initiatives and sustainability, including public transport and alternatives such as cycling, is the opposite of where Ontario should be moving in the face of large scale climate crisis. I urge the Ontario government to consider research, climate initiatives, and the well-being on Ontarians and reject this short-sighted proposal.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is incredibly arrogant and regressive. Traffic congestion is not a new problem, and different solutions are being attempted all over the world. We have so much data and information on this problem, and the majority of it clear in showing that active transit corridors reduce congestion much more than adding lanes for cars.\nEven if this were not the case, why should the provincial government have anything to say about how my community wishes to structure their transportation network? As residents, we pay taxes, and we elect representatives for our specific needs. Please keep your interests out of my community.\nThe Ford government promised to cut red tape, but this is clearly showing that red tape is only to be cut if money can be made.\n"

        "comment": "The government is acting in bad faith and not following their own legislation by deciding to remove bike lanes without evidence in support of them adding to congestion. All reasonable experts suggest that more lanes of traffic lead to more congestion via induced demand. Bike lanes not only make our cities safer for cyclists but they help to reduce congestion by giving residents choices when planning trips within their cities. Adding red tape that flies in the face of evidence makes me lose faith in this government\u2019s ability to effectively govern.\n"

I strongly, from a rational perspective of wanting more free-flowing car traffic, oppose the proposed framework.\nThe \"Car Freedom Framework\" I propose is to build more opportunities for people to bike and take modern efficient transit (e.g., trains), thereby giving freedom to car lanes.\n"

        "comment": "I'm staunchly opposed to removing any bike lanes in Toronto. Please see my comments below:\nBuilding a World-Class City\nToronto aspires to join the ranks of global cities like New York and Paris, but our resistance to essential infrastructure like bike lanes holds us back. These cities have embraced cycling infrastructure as part of their transformation into complete communities where people can live, work, and play without relying on cars.\nTraffic Reduction\nContrary to popular belief, bike lanes actually help reduce traffic congestion. By giving people safe alternatives to driving for short trips, we remove cars from the road. This benefits drivers by reducing overall congestion, particularly during rush hour.\nSafety First\nBike lanes save lives - period. Protected cycling infrastructure significantly reduces collisions between cyclists and vehicles, making streets safer for everyone, including pedestrians and drivers.\nEconomic Benefits\nStreets with bike lanes see increased foot traffic and local business revenue. When people can safely bike to shops and restaurants, they're more likely to stop and spend money. Studies show cyclists actually spend more at local businesses over time compared to drivers.\nStrategic Corridors\nMajor arteries like Bloor Street are crucial for bike infrastructure. These continuous east-west routes allow cyclists to efficiently cross the city, just as drivers rely on these streets. Removing bikes from these corridors would force cyclists onto smaller streets, increasing travel times and pushing more people back to cars.\nAdditional Benefits:\n- Environmental impact: Increased cycling reduces emissions and improves air quality\n- Public health: Active transportation helps combat sedentary lifestyles\n- Cost-effective: Bike lanes are significantly cheaper to build and maintain than car infrastructure\n- Social equity: Cycling provides affordable transportation for all income levels\n- Community building: Bike-friendly streets encourage more neighborhood interaction\nConclusion:\nBike lanes aren't just about cyclists - they're about building a more livable, prosperous, and sustainable city for everyone. The evidence from cities worldwide shows that investing in cycling infrastructure pays dividends in public health, economic growth, and quality of life. Toronto can't afford to move backwards by removing bike lanes if we want to compete as a truly world-class city.\n"

        "comment": "As a city resident, I believe our communities should be designed to support more active modes of transportation like biking and walking. This piece of legislation makes it unsafe for thousands of bikers who use these roads to commute to work and school everyday. All across the world, governments are looking to reduce their environmental footprint but the Ford administration is pushing people into being more dependent on cars. Who are these policies profiting? Not the people, not our communities, not our environment. Oil is an expensive and increasingly scare commodity, and our current oil and petroleum consumption will have to be reduced significantly in the next decade. Using cars is not a financially or environmentally sustainable mode of transportation. This legislation is pushing us to use more petrol and diesel, that the same governments will not be able to provide affordably in the next few years. It is shortsighted and results in a bad precedence for future bike lane constructions across the province. I oppose it in its entirety, and urge the government to put forward policies that promote healthy communities and lifestyles.\n"

Removing the bike lanes will be dangerous for cyclists and non-cyclists with constant threat of getting run over by a large vehicle. We should be pushing for more bike lanes instead of fighting against them.\n"
