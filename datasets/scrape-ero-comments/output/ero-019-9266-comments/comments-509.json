This will create more pollution, put more people in danger, and create even greater gridlock due to the induced demand for cars. Please reconsider, as it would make the city safer, more accessible for those that live there, cheaper to live in, and ease traffic if this bill does not pass and bike infrastructure continues to be developed\n"

Bicycle lanes offer some sort of alternative to that and it would be a very backward and illogical move to revert.\nPremier Ford and Government, we are calling on your leadership to ensure that you do not overstep formal jurisdiction to interfere with Toronto Bicycle lanes. Please get the province moving with the transit projects you PROMISED to be delivered.\nPremier Ford, your goal should be to provide as many Ontarians as possible with more transportation options, not remove them to please a select few.\nPlease do the logical thing, Premier Ford and Government. Please protect the Toronto bicycle lanes and ensure that various transport methods are available around the province, other than cars. Please protect the Yonge Street bicycle lanes and ensure they are not removed. Please protect all Toronto bicycle lanes and ensure they are not removed!\nYour next election and political credibility will depend on it.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to Bill 212. This bill is deeply misguided and will have devastating consequences for Toronto, contributing to the very problems it claims to address. As a concerned citizen and a constituent, I am committed to doing everything within my power to prevent its passage. I urge you to consider the long-term effects this bill will have on our city and province.\nCountless studies show that bike lanes alleviate congestion through the phenomenon of induced demand, where more road space for alternative forms of transportation reduces the number of single-occupancy vehicles on the road. Cities around the world have used bike lanes and public transit investments to improve traffic flow and provide safer, faster alternatives to driving. Expanding lanes for vehicles while reducing infrastructure for bikes, on the other hand, has been proven to worsen congestion. Toronto already faces significant traffic issues, and adding more car lanes will only exacerbate these problems.\nWe are living in a time when Canadians are increasingly aware of the environmental and social impact of their choices. More and more people are turning to cycling, public transit, and carpooling as practical and responsible commuting options to reduce carbon emissions and shorten commute times. It is shocking that Bill 212 would attempt to undermine these positive changes, especially given the pressing need to address climate change.\nAdditionally, my fellow constituents and I are appalled by the bill\u2019s attempt to eliminate the environmental assessment for the proposed Highway 413. This reckless approach bypasses crucial evaluations needed to understand the environmental and societal impacts of new developments. If our government ignores these assessments, it risks irreversible damage to Ontario\u2019s natural landscape and fails in its duty to future generations.\nPlease reconsider your stance on this disastrous bill. As long as it remains associated with the current government, I will work alongside other citizens to stop it through peaceful democratic means, including protesting and campaigning to protect our community and environment.\nThank you for your attention to this urgent matter. I look forward to seeing a decision that values the well-being of all Ontarians, present and future.\n"

        "comment": "As a city of Toronto resident and daily commuter whose means of getting to work is via bicycle 365 days a year, I stridently oppose the government of Ontario's overstepping into municipal affairs, to dictate where bike lanes can and cannot go. This bill represents gross governmental overreaching, and tearing up existing bicycle infrastructure is additionally a disrespectful waste of taxpayer money that could be spent on real issues like affordable housing. Bike lanes save lives, improve cities and local businesses, and encourage LESS gridlock by offering alternatives to yet more cars on the road. Before the bike lanes on busy roads like Bloor and Yonge Street, I never felt safe on my bike and had many close calls with being doored, cut off, and subject to driver aggression. Now, many more cyclists feel comfortable and able to get around the city, and data-based reports have shown there is no impact on gridlock within Toronto whatsoever from bike lanes which close down a car lane. Save Toronto's bike lanes from baseless claims of 'gridlock,' and value residents lives over vehicles.\n"

Even walking on the sidewalk seemed unsafe. Walking to Islington subway station is now relatively pleasant.\nWalking to shops on The Kingsway has a village feel similar to Bloor West Village. This is positive as I spend more time and money in the neighbourhood. From my perspective, it is helping local businesses thrive.\nI also drive and use Dundas W when needing to head eastbound\nI use the subway rather than drive when heading eastbound on Bloor\nI ride my bike and now use the lanes with confidence. I would never ride my bike on Bloor without dedicated lanes.\nI\u2019m not anti-car but we have too many on Bloor Street - as per above, there are viable options\nSincerely,\nB/\n"

        "comment": "As a young professional in a world of wide ranging opportunities, one of the most attractive features of Toronto has been its non-driver friendly infrastructure. Making my home here has been significantly dependent on the TTC and bike friendly roads and paths. On the other hand, I have seen accident after accident among friends and have lost people I love due to unsafe conditions on certain high traffic roads. As someone who has personally survived hit and runs and multiple car accidents, I cherish roads with additional designations and safety for bikers. We as a city need to promote safety for bikers and that will not come by reducing lanes on major streets. In fact, I fear we will only lose more lives to worse conditions. Toronto has the opportunity to be a leader on the global stage when it comes to providing for the majority of citizens who are distinctly not car driving commuters. Most of us get to work and where we need to be by biking, walking, and TTC. We should be promoting healthy activity rather than making it significantly less safe for bikers. If we get rid of lanes, bikers will be forced on to sidewalks as we already see on these busier streets such as Bloor. We specifically see this with Uber and Doordash bikers. Avoiding unsafe roads, they ride on sidewalks. Their lives matter and their service has come to be relied upon by large portions of the population. We cannot take for granted their labour and their lives nor can we ignore that this proposal would benefit the business class above commuting workers who are simply trying to reduce their emissions and remain active. Our health and safety deserves to be taken seriously and so I am strongly against this proposal and would propose instead further development of bike lanes and pedestrian safe infrastructure. Thank you for your time and consideration.\n"

        "comment": "This proposed bill causes me great concern:\n1) The decision seems to be based on political strategizing, not real evidence or data. Prioritizing the interests of Conservative car-drivers (and having an axe to grind against progressives) is clearly more important than anything else.\n2) I thought fiscal responsibility was a priority of this government. We've heard about \"stopping the gravy train\" for years, so how does that square with removing infrastructure that has already benefitted from significant public investment? What a colossal waste of taxpayers' money.\n3) The fact is, existing cycling infrastructure in Ontario is mediocre at best. For that reason, I don't cycle the streets and I worry when my husband bikes around our city.\nWith some notable exceptions (e.g. the new cycling lanes along Plains Road in Burlington), most of the infrastructure does not fully follow best practices. Countless cities in Europe have demonstrated that cycling infrastructure does what it's intended to do -- reduce traffic congestion, decrease pollution and increase healthful living -- when it is fully supported and implemented in a robust manner. That means using curbs and bollards to separate cyclists from drivers.\nIt makes zero sense to implement bike lanes across Ontario using half measures, and then remove them because they're \"not working.\" You either commit to success or you commit to failure.\nThe bottom line: we need to lean in to building this infrastructure, not pulling out bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "There a few things I have issue with this bill. Mainly that it prioritizes people whose preferred mode of transport are cars, and not bikes. Why should someone who drives a car get preferential treatment over bikers who use their bike as their preferred mode and primary mode of transport around cities.\nCities should have the ability to improve the lives of their constituents without overstepping of the provincial government. City voters elect their local council with certain issues in mind, such as safe and fast bike transport. Adding this bill will create more bureaucracy to an already slow system.\nAnother are the stats about only 1.2% of people use bike for commuting in Toronto. That is misleading. In areas that there are more and developed bike lane infrastructure the number of people commuting and doing errands on bikes are higher. Imagine if we had the same network of safe bike infrastructure as we currently do with car infrastructure. That number would be much much higher. This can be seen around the world and even in Canada with cities such as Montreal.\nBike lanes are a great way to get individuals out of their car and onto smaller infrastructure. For every person who swaps their car for a bike, it means more space for the people who still need to drive, which reduces traffic.\nIn Ottawa I use my bike as a way to move around the city. There are times I wish there was a more direct safe bike route. Sometimes on what could be a 10km trip I will opt to do a 15km trip to avoid some streets to stay on some of the cities bike lanes instead. Even though I am an experienced cyclist I still prefer the calmness of Multi-use path ways and dedicated bike lanes compared to sharing a lane with cars.\nWhich brings me to another point. I think both cyclists and drivers would prefer cyclists to be in their own bike lane. Having cars move around you is nerve wracking and I have had close calls with aggressive drivers. Having bikes taking up part of a car lane also slows down traffic. It would be ideal to have a completely different infrastructure for mid speed movement such as bikes. We already separate cars from walking with sidewalks.\nThe argument about moving bike lanes off of main roads isn't of actual benefit to bikers. Main, straight corridors are great for bikes and cars to share. The reason why some of these streets are already busy with cars is because of the direct route. Why should we inhibit that same benefit from people commuting on bikes, or scooters?\n"

        "comment": "Toronto has many problems. Too many bike lanes is certainly not one of them.\nThere is an abundance of data that shows that the only measures that can curb congestion in urban areas is to provide safe and efficient alternatives to car use such as public transportation or cycling.\nInstead, the focus on more car traffic endangers the most vulnerable road users, pedestrians and cyclists. The transportation minister's argument are essentially non-sense, and he must be aware of this.\nArgument 1. Not everyone can ride a bike.\nThis is true. But not everyone can drive a car. But they do it anyway because they don't have an alternative. And endanger others in the process. I encourage you to cross any of the busier Toronto intersections on foot during rush hour, or just stand and watch and see how dangerous it is with constant near misses.\nArgument 2. Only X% of people bike. This is because it is incredibly unsafe to cycle in Toronto. I used to cycle my daughter to school when there was a safe bike lane. This has been closed for highway construction. The distance remains the same, but I would now have to cross the 401 on the Don Mills bridge, which is just not safe on a narrow pedestrian strip next to 3 lanes of traffic at 60-70kmh. So now I have to drive and add to congestion.\nThe decisions you make now will shape how transport will look 30 years from now. 30 years ago we didn't know that focusing on car use is a non-viable strategy. Now we know. It is time to start moving towards sustainable, safe, efficient and evidence based solutions. Not populistic election projects.\nI'm happy for bike lanes to be on smaller streets, but then do go ahead and build them. Many European cities went down that way over the last years and their safety and quality of life has increased dramatically as a result. There is no reason this can't work here, it just needs to start somewhere.\n"

Become an actual symbol of the first world and build efficient rail networks to get people and goods out of gridlock.

My commute to work has been shortened by an hour each day, I have visited many more of the shops along Bloor this year than ever before, and I have reduced my time spent in a car tenfold.\nToronto gridlock is terrible. I used to drive in and out of the city before my current job. But no sane person should be driving down Bloor street in an SUV during rush hour traffic. The only way to fix Toronto's issue is to provide people with alternatives to driving into and throughout the city. That comes from TTC, GO trains, and bikes.\nFinally, Toronto is turning into a vibrant, attractive city with a high quality of life. It is drawing workers and corporations from all over the world. People want to live in an accessible city. Bloor Street and University Avenue are more welcoming now than they have ever been before, and small businesses are receiving so much more bike and foot traffic. Returning these streets to inefficient, glorified highways will reverse this impact and make the city a less appealing place to live and work.\nGridlock is important. But this is not the way to fix it. Keep the bike lanes on University and Bloor.\n"

This comes after some amazing progress in the development of safer bike lines in the city. What a shame and a waste of public funds it would be to undo all of this good.\nThis is my feedback as someone who both drives and cycles in downtown Toronto. The Yonge, University and Bloor bike lanes have made my experience as a driver and as a cyclist immensely better from a safety perspective. If we want less cars on the road at one time, we need to enable more people to get on their bicycles. I don't know anyone who regularly cycles in this city that has not had their own close calls or accidents with a motor vehicle. This is just another factor making people more hesitant to make more efficient use of our public roads. Bike lanes give us the confidence to not take the car every single time we need to get somewhere.\nExtra car lanes have never been the solution to traffic. Not in Toronto or any other major city. As we continue to build up the population, we need to better utilize the space we have and bicycles are an excellent way to do this.\nAs a final point, public transit is another solution and making our roads more bikeable supports the ongoing transit investments by making it easier for a larger subset of people to make use of them, bridging the gap for those who are just out of range of existing/future stations and stops.\n"
