        "comment": "Biking on roads in Ontario could be much a better experience if this bill were passed. It seems that the bike lanes in Kingston, my current place of residence, were an afterthought, hurriedly squeezed in on busy thoroughfares as an attempt to appease a growing number of bikers. The limited road-space allocated to bikers can be unsafe, which discourages commuters from traveling via bike. Not only is biking a great cardio exercise (without feeling particularly strenuous), it's also more environmentally friendly than gas-powered cars. In this way, larger bike lanes are conducive to the provinces' existing environmental initiatives.\nA bike-friendly community is a safer, healthier community. If this bill is enacted, no one loses. Thank you for taking the time to read my appeal.\n"

        "comment": "This is an astoundingly stupid waste of provincial government time and resources.\nCountless international and local studies and data points demonstrate that bicycle lanes strengthen local economies by increasing traffic to small businesses, improve emergency vehicle response times, improve local residents happiness, improve safety for cyclists, and advance our progress on climate objectives.\nLeave municipal affairs to city council and focus on actual meaningful issues in our province. This time, attention and money would all be better spent on improving public transit, getting the Eglinton and Finch LRTs completed,\nThe last thing we need is to tear up streets AGAIN to remove infrastructure we have already paid for, in order to accomplish nothing. Cars are the cause of traffic, not bike lanes. Bike lanes protect cyclists from harm, isolate them from the flow of vehicle traffic, and keep them off sidewalks where they pose a risk to pedestrians.\nDo your jobs, and stay out of municipal issues. If a city council wishes to change their approach to cycling infrastructure, then they can pursue that.\n"

        "comment": "The construction of bike lanes at the expense of vehicle lanes, while potentially disruptive for those driving personal vehicles, presents an opportunity for and encourages modes of transport that are more efficient and environmentally friendly. People will and should be encouraged to bike to nearby destinations and take public transit (especially if HOV lanes facilitate it), which will contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emission, and in the case of biking, can improve the health of those partaking.\n"

        "comment": "This is a horrendous bill that fails to acknowledge already determined facts about roads.  You\u2019re over reaching your authority and meddling in municipal decisions.  Bike lanes and local infrastructure are the purview of each municipality and not a decision for the province.  If you have a problem with local municipalities making decisions decided by local citizens through voting, you\u2019re opposing the democratic society the people of Ontario deserve\nThe province should not acknowledge the need for the 413 and should not build it.  It is a catastrophic waste that will result in further infrastructure costs including road maintenance, snow removal, grade and so forth as well as consume greenbelt land that is needed for Ontario\u2019s self reliance by promoting local food production.  The land is also important to prevent flooding and reducing damages from the impacts of climate change.\nIf you\u2019d like to actually reduce gridlock, strategies are needed for mass public transit.  Trains and subways would be fantastic across southern Ontario and take thousands of cars off the road to allow drivers to move freely while still getting people where they need to go.\n"

        "comment": "I live and work in downtown Toronto. I have lived here for 15 years, long before bike lanes started replacing car lanes. I have commute about 10km each way daily to work. I commute by various modes -- sometimes car, sometimes bike, sometimes public transit. Long before there were bike lanes on Bloor, Richmond, etc., cycling was the fastest way to get to work. Driving has always taken between 35-50 minutes -- even before the removal of car lanes for bike lanes. This has NOT gotten worse with the removal of car lanes. Show me a traffic study that says it has. Rather, the only thing that has changed is that biking has become safer and more enjoyable. As a mother of two young children, I do not wish to die on my way to work as I am forced to weave between cars. Also, the number of cyclists has increased, removing people from cars that create gridlock. Look at any great European city and you will find bike lanes dominate - Amsterdam, Copenhagen, London, Stockholm, even New York City -- all places that have invested in active transportation because they know that getting people out of cars is what reduces gridlock, not making more room for cars. There are mountains of data to back this up. The best way to reduce gridlock is to encourage other forms of transportation, not make more room for cars. Invest in more bike lanes and more transit and stop meddling in municipal affairs.\n"

        "comment": "The provincial government's decision to limit the installation of bike lanes by municipalities is not based on facts. I have several points to make as follows:\n1) Most streets do not have bike lanes, yet there is congestion and bumper-to-bumper traffic every day. This is because the cause of traffic jams is NOT bike lanes or cyclists -- it is too many motor vehicles (many with single occupants).\n2) Vehicle parking -- even along major streets, often both sides -- has removed far more vehicle lanes than bike lanes have.\n3) Research in Toronto has shown that bike lanes result in MORE business for retail and services along main streets.\n4) The government professes to want people to get home to their families. Bike lanes make streets safer for cyclists, drivers, and pedestrians because cyclists are in their own lane rather than mixing with traffic or riding on sidewalks to avoid more vehicles. This is a safety issue, at a time when Toronto has seen increased cyclist deaths. The government is further endangering cyclists by blaming them for problems they do not cause (see point 1 above), thus enboldening critics of cyclists looking for someoen to blame for traffic jams.\n5) Tearing out existing bike lanes is a waste of taxpayer money regardless of which level of government pays the bill.\n6) The Transport Minister seems unaware that cyclists ride in rain, heat, cold, and light snow.\n7) Cycling is a healthy activity that is easy on infrastructure and the environment. It should be encouraged.\nIn short, bike lanes solve problems; they do not create problems.\nThank you.\n"

        "comment": "I think this move by the Government is a bad one, it is going backwards. If we provide adequate public transportation this would not have been an issue as there would be lesser number of cars on the road. With very poor attention to public transportation infrastructure and lack of mass transit throughout the province the government is forcing people to use the cars. This is also a financial burden on many young people who are barely able to make their ends meet. They would opt for bicycles for mobility, if you make that option either unavailable or unsafe it\u2019s long term effect will be harmful to the society at large. I hope the government will consider suitable alternatives.\n"

There have been motorcyclists and cyclists killed in traffic by motorists on my intersecting streets, which have no cycling lanes. I would like to commute but do not feel safe doing so.  It would benefit so many people in my area of town to have more cycle lanes, promoting safety and health. Please consider this proposal for high traffic areas; while it seems counterintuitive to reduce gridlock by reducing lanes, providing feasible alternate commuter methods supports the reduction of grid lock in the long run.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is downright awful policy that will do nothing to relieve congestion in the long run and will result in many more injured and dead cyclists. Do your research on induced demand and consult and truly world class city - increasing public transit and safe cycling options is the only way to create sustainable healthy and efficient transportation systems. I cycle on bloor street every day with my two year old child and cannot imagine doing so without the safety of a bike lane. The major arterial roads are the best place for bike lanes as there are not options to get across the city otherwise and residents will not want major bike highways on side streets. Plus bike lanes on major roads bring significant business and are essential to food couriers, who use them to pick up and transport food. Please think holistically and long term in considering this policy and make cycling safer and more appealing so more people are inclined to leave their cars at home and take a bike! How about that for congestion reduction strategy. ALSO the argument that bike lanes are only used in summer is bogus - I and many other cycle year round, and if there is slightly less demand for the TWO months a year when there is snow on the ground, so be it. PLEASE reconsider this legislation - stay out of municipal transportation planning and let cyclists live.\n"

        "comment": "I am a civil designer in the transit sector designing light rail and roadways in the city of Toronto for 7 years. This is the single worst policy that I have ever seen. The risk to life imposed by this bill would be incomprehensible. Based on the design process in toronto which is already drawn out this would lead to an extra level of beaurocrasy and waste of taxpayer money reviewing bike lanes where the local municipality knows best.\nIf passed this would be an embarrament to the city of toronto that would be spoken about in engineering classes worldwide as a failure of policy.\nIf you are making a decision like this you should speak to transit engineers, no politician should be making this type of decision without the support of the amazing engineers and planners of this country\n"

Oh, and stop signs too.\nPlease consider removing all on street parking spaces where they take up a lane. In many places these parking spaces cause bottlenecks where traffic could instead, just flow smoothly.\nPlease consider the paradox that more lanes equals less congestion. This is only true if the number of cars on the road remains the same. If more lanes equals less congestion, then why is there still congestion? There are more roads than ever before! More roads = more congestion.\n"

        "comment": "Dear Premier Ford and the Honourable Prabmeet Sarkaria,\nI wanted to get your help in changing a serious flaw with the Bill 212 - Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act. I was looking it over and it appears geared to \u201csave drivers and businesses time and money\u201d, instead of saving regular people and business time and money. It is a small but critical nuance, as cars are inefficient for moving large numbers of people around, and do not have the same impact as other modes of transportation in helping businesses. For example, the article for City News dated October 24th 2024 shared that the Bloor Street BIA said that their bike lane has been good for business. This is largely because more people can make it to business in more efficient ways. If you are hoping to help regular folk, I would recommend that you instead focus on helping to provide more than one mode of transportation to destinations, and if you are really unsure about bike lanes, please give municipalities the funds to help collect data on their use.\n"
