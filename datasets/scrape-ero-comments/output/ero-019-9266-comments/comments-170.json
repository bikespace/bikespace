        "comment": "I am against this proposal for the removal of bike lanes to create space for car lanes and for the provincial government to be involved in the creation of bike lanes as numerous studies have repeatedly shown that adding more car lanes and highways only increases gridlock and congestion. Many locations in our downtown cores have small businesses but little to no parking or limited capacity to host cars due to the city plan. These areas and their businesses are more easily accessible by public transportation and bikes which makes it more important to increase funding to public transport and increasing the infrastructure for dedicated safe bike lanes.\nIncreasing car lanes will only increase congestion and will have increasingly negative environmental and health consequences.\nOntario need high speed rail connecting more of Ontario to take cars out of roads and reduce car congestion from out of city commuters. Ontarians need higher frequency and more interconnected public transit systems to connect local residents to their neighbourhoods. Ontarians need more dedicated bike lanes for recreation and a more energizing commute. Bike lanes and public transportation systems are more beneficial to our health and happiness on an individual, municipal and global level.\n"

People who drive cars are not second class citizens and their needs should be considered in proportion to their road use. Having said that cyclist safety is an important consideration and should be part of the evaluation of future routes.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is insane, cannot understand how such a blatantly partisan bill is even being considered. Open corruption is the name of the game in this province lately. Eliminating bike lanes!? What year is this? The authors of this bill deserve jail time. Allowing environmental exemptions to build a useless highway just to pad developers pockets. Ontario really has a unique distinction of being the province most capable of finding the worst possible solution to any problem. Beating Alberta in ignoring environmental concerns is a real accomplishment. Ford and his current government make me ashamed to live in this province.\n"

        "comment": "Adding one more lane will not resolve traffic in any city. What will resolve logjams is an upgrade and investment into our public transit systems.\nBikes lanes help reduce traffic as they remove people who would ordinarily take a car/bus/train out of our roads. It's a great cardiovascular exercise that our population needs the side effect of which is a healther population that doesn't strain our already strained healthcare infrastructure.\n"

        "comment": "Even if it were just about bike lanes, this bill would be utterly idiotic. Bike lanes are a near-universal net good. Even if it weren't for the fact that they encourage biking and get cars off the road, bicycle-vehicle collisions, injuries and fatalities continue to occur at a completely unacceptable rate, meaning that this decision to put additional red tape in the way is directly against the public good.\nMoreover, the bill contains language completely unrelated to bike lanes, specifically relating to removing environmental assessment steps for highway construction and speeding land expropriation for the same. This signals the bill's true intention: this shortsighted, dangerous stance on bike lanes is nothing more than a smokescreen providing cover for yet more accountability dodging related to the proposed highway 413, a highway that expert planners agree is unnecessary and a massive waste of taxpayer money, and serves only to benefit property developers with direct personal and financial ties to Doug Ford.\nAs this bill is coming from a position of brazen bad faith, is against the public good, flies in the face of all logic and proposes regulatory exceptions for a matter of significant conflict of interest, I urge that it be scrapped in its entirety.\n"

        "comment": "Currently municipal transportation decisions are made by municipal officials informed by local knowledge and in consultation with local residents. I am not supportive of this legislation and the removal of local authority to make decisions around bike lanes. The addition of bike lanes and the creation of defined cycling routes increases local economic development opportunities and supports economic diversification efforts. If anything, provincial legislation should encourage and provide incentives to  municipalities to adopt forms of active transportation during this critical period were Ontario residents are directly experiencing the impacts of climate change. I strongly discourage the government from approving and enacting this legislation.\n"

        "comment": "This is such a braindead move. Why would you continue to waste tax payer money on removing bike lines when they\u2019re already built? Nice ones at that. Most importantly, congestion and car traffic would increase if there are no viable alternatives, if I can\u2019t bike, walk, or use public transportation, then I\u2019d have to drive like every other person who would\u2019ve biked or walked. Adding more cars on the road, and no, more lanes will not fix the problem, it would just encourage more people to drive (induced demand). Building bike lines should remain at the municipal level as cities know their local area, while the provincial government should focus on larger problems like our poor healthcare and education systems. Also having more bike and pedestrian friendly spaces reduces carbon emissions and promotes exercising. Also it\u2019s prohibitively more expensive owning a car than a bike, particularly impacting people who can\u2019t afford a car or cannot drive. Bikes also don\u2019t ruin roads as much and as quickly as cars, making them financially and ecologically better in the long term. Please, I feel it\u2019s always one step forward and two steps back when it comes to public transit/walkability development in Ontario. This legislation would be a huge step backwards in making cities sustainable in the long run.\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nI am a Toronto resident. I am begging you to please not rip out any bike lanes. My husband rides his bike to work every day. It\u2019s what we can afford. I am already incredibly anxious every time he leaves home. It\u2019s already so dangerous out there for pedestrians and cyclists. He promises me to stick to roads with safe bike lanes. But sometimes they don\u2019t exist and if you rip up the ones he uses his life is going to be in danger. Please don\u2019t do this.\nAll evidence, within Toronto and around the world show that bike lanes make for better safer more liveable cities.\nThere is no logical reason to remove bike lanes. If there aren\u2019t bike lanes cyclists get to take up lanes on the road. Wouldn\u2019t that just make more congestion.\nWe need more bike lanes not less. I would ride my bike to work as well but there is no current safe route for me. I\u2019ve been waiting and waiting hoping that one day there would be a full bike on eglinton. But now that\u2019s even in jeopardy.\nAre there not better things that the provincial government can spend their time in. Leave these decision s up to municipalities.\nI really hope these comments actually get seen by decision makers. No offence to the amazing admin workers that work behind the scenes but sometimes it feels like these feedback forms are just for show. Because it really doesn\u2019t seem like anybody actually listens to the people.  The people of Toronto want bike lanes the businesses in Toronto want bike planes families in Toronto want bike planes to keep our loved ones safe.  Why does the government want to make unsafe cities? How does that make any sense?  Why are these decisions being made by people who commute into the city? Why isn\u2019t the government listening to the people who actually live in the city and want to make it a better place?\n"

Cars are a horribly inefficient method of transportation, let alone their environmental impact. Encouraging the use of these inefficient vehicles is the wrong decision here.\nThis is also a major overstep of provincial powers. The government is strong arming power away from their people that live in those areas and shifting it to a bunch of people who may not even visited that city before.\nHorrible policy from a horrible government. I can't wait to donate my $200 rebate cheque to your opposition.\n"

One big reason why I had decided to move from Toronto to Ottawa was because of how unsafe the city was for bikers. I would often arrive to my Bay St desk in tears because I would be yelled at by drivers who were frustrated by the bumper to bumper traffic. Ontario has no right to try to eliminate bike lanes when those contribute to a greener city, less traffic and a healthy city. I strongly oppose this and certainly will make that known with my vote at the next provincial election.\n"
