We have to do everything we can to make sure there\u2019s never a death in the city. One death is way too many when it comes to bicycle riders.\" \u2013 Doug Ford\nBike lanes aren\u2019t just lines on the road they save lives. Here\u2019s why we need to keep them:\n* They keep people safe. Bike lanes give cyclists a dedicated space, making the road safer for everyone.\n* They\u2019re good for business. Cyclists often stop to shop at local businesses, bringing more customers to our communities.\n* They help the environment. More people on bikes means fewer cars on the road, reducing pollution and our city\u2019s carbon footprint.\n* They\u2019re great for health. Riding is an easy way to stay active and helps reduce healthcare costs down the line.\n* They make the city more accessible. Bike lanes offer everyone a low-cost, easy way to get around.\n* They reduce congestion. When more people bike, fewer cars are on the road, freeing up space and easing traffic for everyone.\nAnd honestly, this should be the city\u2019s decision, not the province\u2019s. Local communities know best what works for their own streets. Let\u2019s make sure our city keeps moving forward, not backward.\nStay in your lane, keep our bike lanes!\n"

These bike lanes were implemented after research, community consultation and reflect the needs and interests of the city of Toronto. I use the Bloor and university bike lanes to commute to work and appreciate their space to protect my safety.\nI will not support this government\u2019s short sightedness on wasting government money on things that are not within its purview. Let the city of Toronto manage itself. The provincial government should be focused on broader issues like health care.\n"

        "comment": "I am writing to express my strong opposition to Bill 212 as it relates to the removal of existing bicycle lanes and support for the continued implementation and retention of bicycle lanes across Toronto. As a resident, voter and taxpayer of the City of Toronto and the Province of Ontario, I believe that protected cycling infrastructure is essential to enhancing urban mobility, improving public health, and addressing the growing environmental challenges we face.\nBicycle lanes offer a multitude of benefits to the city and its residents. First and foremost, they promote sustainable transportation by encouraging more people to choose cycling over driving. This not only reduces traffic congestion and pollution but also contributes to our collective goals of lowering greenhouse gas emissions. With cities around the world prioritizing active transportation as part of their climate action strategies, it is crucial that Toronto and Ontario remains leaders in this space.\nThe Toronto Official Plan has set out clear policy objectives that promote active transportation over private vehicles since it was adopted by City Council in 2002 and the Province in 2005. Specifically, Section 2.2.4 of the Official Plan states:\n4. The City\u2019s transportation system will be maintained and developed to support the growth management objectives of this Plan by:\na) developing the key elements of the transportation system in a mutually supportive manner which prioritizes walking, cycling and transit over other passenger transportation modes.\nIt is unclear how the proposed Bill 212 aligns with the long-established policies of the City of Toronto's Official Plan.\nIn addition to environmental advantages, dedicated bike lanes significantly improve safety for cyclists, pedestrians, and motorists. By providing a clear separation between different modes of transportation, these lanes reduce the likelihood of accidents, making the streets safer for all road users. Research shows that cities with robust cycling infrastructure see a notable decrease in road injuries, which can help alleviate strain on emergency services and healthcare systems. This is good for the taxpayers of Ontario.\nMoreover, bicycle lanes enhance overall urban livability. They provide affordable, accessible transportation options, fostering greater equity among residents, particularly those who may not own vehicles or prefer not to rely on public transit. They also contribute to the health and well-being of residents, encouraging physical activity and reducing the risk of lifestyle-related illnesses.\nWhile some may argue that bicycle lanes take away space from cars, it is important to recognize that the long-term benefits of a multimodal transportation network far outweigh any perceived inconvenience. By prioritizing cycling, walking, and public transit, Toronto can create a more balanced, resilient, and future-ready transportation system that benefits everyone.\nAs Toronto continues to grow, it is essential to invest in infrastructure that supports sustainable, efficient, and healthy forms of transportation. I urge you to not only retain but expand the network of bicycle lanes throughout the city and the province, ensuring that Toronto remains a livable and environmentally responsible city for generations to come.\nThank you for your attention to this important issue. I hope that the Province of Ontario will revise its approach to bicycle lanes in Bill 212 and continue to prioritize the implementation of bicycle lanes as part of its vision for a safer, greener, and more connected Toronto and Ontario.\n"

        "comment": "An evidence based approach needs to be applied to this issue. The rights of drivers are not primary over non-driving citizens. In order to reduce gridlock we need to look to alternative modes of transportation as cars are clearly an inefficient mode of transportation and this government needs to apply the common sense it supposedly loves. This is without considering the untold tax dollars of the tax payers that will be wasted exacting this personal vendetta.\n"

STAY in YOUR LANE and out of Toronto municipal decisions.  Why spend more taxpayer dollars for no benefit to congestion?!  Review of new proposed bike lanes? - OK IF it's impartial and wholistic to all forms of transit...  spending $$ to make changes that already cost $$ is WRONG\n"

        "comment": "The removal of cycling tracks and bike lanes will not achieve reduced gridlock in downtown Toronto, it will do the opposite.\nThe removal of bike lanes will only increase traffic for a variety of reasons:\n1. Cyclists will continue to use the roads despite it not having a bike lane, which results in cyclists biking in the lanes with the cars.  There is not enough room in the lane for cars and bikes to share the road side-by-side, so cars will need to drive around the bike.\n2. A lot of cyclists will 'take the lane' because it is their right to do so, so cars will be driving behind cyclists going slower than traffic.\n2. A number of cyclists might choose to drive instead because of the dangers of biking on the road with cars, leading to more cars on the road.\nWith the cost of living going up, we should be encouraging people to use whatever method of transportation is best for them.  The bike lanes are seeing higher than ever use.  The more a mode of transportation becomes more readily available, more people will use it, it's induced demand.  The more car lanes that are built, the more cars will use it, which will directly result in more cars on the road, and increase gridlock. The more bike lanes built, the more cyclists will use it.  One more cyclist in the bike lanes means one less car on the road.\nWhen speaking specifically about the bike lanes and cycle tracks in Toronto (University/Bloor/Yonge), the transportation needs of residents of Toronto should be prioritized.  Prioritizing the transportation needs of the residents of Toronto does not mean discounting the needs of people who need to drive into the City.  These three roads are 100% arterial roads for cars, bikes, pedestrians.  I personally use 2 of the 3 major roads to get to work by bike. I use these roads because they are the most direct route to work.  There is no cycling infrastructure on secondary roads that would allow myself or any cyclist to get to point A to point B in the same amount of time as these roads do.\nThere is no one demographic of cyclist. The bike lanes and cycle tracks are used by all - people who are commuters, people going out for a leisure bike ride, parents dropping their kids off at activities and school, people running errands, people getting from point A to B, tourists, etc.\nThe removal of cycle tracks and bike lanes will lead to cyclists being killed. Protected bike lanes are crucial as a means to keep our Toronto residents safe.\n"

        "comment": "Most municipalities have too many bike lanes built mostly for politically connected, more affluent residents.  They are poorly used and very expensive to build.  We call them vanity projects.\nWhat is sad is that there are miles of little used bike lanes, but the province and the municipalities cannot built surfaces, turf or tracks for children, youth, families and seniors to use.  For example, in our municipality of London Ontario, there is not 1 (one) usable track surface for school use or community use.  Further there is no governance or leadership for planning the utilization of school facilities in after hours.\nAsk the club system, families and residents what is more important, bike paths or better sports/community facilities for sports and personal use.  The club system is dying because they cannot find usable, affordable facilities. Bike lanes should be last priority.  Fix the school assets, make they usable for the community and fix the governance of these scarce assets due to lack of leadership, partnership skills and funding gaps.  This is an easy problem to solve.\nJoe Ryder 519-860-2222\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is reactive, careless, and not evidence based. Bike lanes increase business for businesses on major roads, make it safer to get around, and contribute to making Toronto a world class city. For the vast majority of people in Toronto, biking is an excellent mode of transportation. I regularly use Bloor and University to commute safely to work. The majority of Canadians don\u2019t have the luxury of putting their feet up in their suburban home (Etobicoke) and weekend access to a massive cottage (Muskoka).\nThe solution is obviously to get cars off the road. To do this, bike infrastructure needs to be improved, public transport networks expanded, and by prioritizing initiatives that reduce CO2 emissions.\n"

It also is a very quick way to get across bloor street and without it, will just make traffic worse as people won\u2019t want to bike because it will be unsafe and they will chose to drive instead. Toronto needs MORE bike lanes, not less and removing the bike lane would be a massive step in the wrong direction. As someone who uses the bike lane every day, it is an essential part of thousand\u2019s of Torontonians daily commute. It also increases the walkability of the area and has been made being a pedestrian on Bloor feel more safe and enjoyable. It\u2019s very upsetting that it\u2019s removal is even being considered.\n"

Instead, developers are building entire towers with bike parking. It's cheaper, and it gives people options. But will people want to live in these buildings if they can't get from home to work safely? This is the biggest thing the City of Toronto has done to make housing more affordable, and removing bike lanes jeopardizes developers taking advantage of it.\n"

Traffic for miles and empty bike lanes.\nNot to mention how ageist and ableist the bike lanes on a main hub like Bloor street are as well.  If you are young or old, you are not welcome on Bloor.\nAs well, Amber Morley's very undemocratic approach to bike lane implementation has been very disappointing, refusing to listen to both the voting public and the data which has shown barely a 3% usage of total traffic on Bloor West.    She is driven only by ideology and activism which is not what an elected official is there to do.\nThank you for introducing common sense and keeping traffic moving, diverting bike lanes off the main arteries of this city.    It's a win for all.\n"
