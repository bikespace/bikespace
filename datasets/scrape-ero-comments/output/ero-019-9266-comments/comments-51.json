        "comment": "This is an egregious breach of powers, and yet another attempt of Doug Ford meddling in Toronto politics. How is it that this proposal says bike lanes built in the past 5 years will be assessed, yet just this morning Premier Ford came out and specifically said Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue in Toronto will be targeted?? How has the Province determined this already? In what study? Oh right, there is no study because nothing is evidence-based anymore.\nIt is disappointing that the Province does not support active transportation as we are in the middle of a climate emergency. Further, please explain to me how removing bike lanes on these arterials will move vehicular traffic faster!?!?!  Because it won't. You are ignoring a large collection of transportation studies and evidence that suggests the opposite. Why are you focusing on tearing up existing bike lanes? Spend that energy completing regional transportation projects (i.e. Eglington Crosstown) instead, per your purview. That will get people moving efficiently.\nStop the war on cyclists. It is dangerous and illogical. Shame on you.\n"

These bike lanes allow for an environmentally friendly commute to work and recreation on the weekends. Removing the bike lanes will not improve traffic and instead make it worse as it will just put cyclists in front of cars. Cyclists, which typically move slower than cars will now take space and force vehicles to move slower.\nThis bill is WRONG and should be reevaluated by unbiased experts.\n"

Now we have more cars on the road, more pollution, and this will do absolutely nothing to reduce traffic. Bike Share Toronto statistics are clear, bike usage is growing year after year in the city of Toronto. Stopping people from using bikes and forcing them to use their cars is going to make gridlock and pollution worse. This is a bad legislation.\n"

It\u2019s important for municipalities to continue to enjoy the freedom to make decisions that will affect their constituents without provincial oversight.\nGridlock would be reduced by investing in transit and making it convenient for users and convincing them to choose less car trips, buying back the 407, or freeing up our allotted federal funding for housing near transit or bike lanes that will give people the option not to use a motor vehicle.\nGiving folks the option to use other methods doesn\u2019t mean we want to get rid of cars, we just want other options that don\u2019t mean we have to drive because it\u2019s the most convenient way to get around.\n"

Dedicated cycle tracks allows for smoother traffic. There should be consideration of removing on-street parking for major Toronto streets. While cycle tracks support reducing congestion by providing an alternative to driving, on-street parking results in a closure of a traffic lane for single occupancy vehicles to stay idle. Lack of cycle tracks will lead to deaths.\n"

        "comment": "There is lots of evidence that adding car lanes does NOT help in aiding congestion. Repurposing bike lanes into car lanes therefore is completely counterintuitive and will likely worsen congestion, transportation costs, and heighten emissions. People will be left with less choices and will be forced to go for a miserable drive instead of enjoying exercise and fresh air on their bikes. Give people choices for their commute and make sure cycling can be a safe and convenient choice. Providing safe,protected,separated bike lanes will encourage more people to try out biking and has the promise of easing congestion in this manner.\n"

        "comment": "Strongly opposed to this. As someone who actually lives in and travels around Toronto, rather than just driving in on weekends, the issue is not bike lanes or cyclists, but rather that there are TOO MANY CARS. Traffic is composed of cars, and if you make it more difficult for people to get around without a car, then you will increase the amount of cars on the road, thereby worsening traffic.\nThe streets in Toronto with the worst traffic have no bike lanes. Regularly, when cycling on those streets, I and other cyclists cruise past gridlocked cars without an issue. It reiterates the point that traffic is caused by too many cars.\nIf the province instead strengthened its commitment to supporting the freedom of Ontarians to choose how they get around cities by providing them with more, useful, non-car options, then we would see a meaningful impact on traffic. The building of the Ontario Line and the expansion/modernisation of GO's rail network are bold steps in the right direction. We need more action like that, and action that will give locals the freedom to leave their car at home and get around the city by bike, streetcar, or subway. Don't go down this communist path of having a central politburo decide how everyone should live. Give us the freedom to decide ourselves.\n"

        "comment": "If the government had consulted with any transportation engineer before drafting up this bill, they would have learned that adding bike lanes REDUCES traffic in the long term. By creating safe routes for cyclists to get to work, school, or run errands, you are reducing the amount of cars on the road. Trying to get rid of existing bike lanes and creating hurdles for installing new bike lanes does not make logical sense. I am vehemently opposed to this bill. I find it disrespectful that it would even be proposed, because it shows how little effort and research my government representatives put into their bills and laws. I would expect elected officials to do research and consult with professionals, rather than doing whatever they want and creating more gridlock and traffic in this province, because they based their decisions on common misconceptions and not facts. Make it easier to build subways and bike lanes, make alternative modes of transit fast and convenient. Prioritizing cars will just make more people drive, which will create more traffic. This bill does not make sense and should be trashed.\nBike lanes can and are used year round. Ontario winters are getting shorter and warmer, thanks to the government's lack of action on curbing climate change (for example: making it harder to build bike lanes and getting rid of existing bike lanes, to favour gas guzzling, greenhouse gas emitting vehicles). They also accommodate round 7500 people per hour. Meanwhile roads for cars accommodate only 1600 people per hour, as a HIGH estimate. I have included a link to this study below.\nPlease do your research and get rid of this bill. It will only make things worse.\n"

Bike lanes are great but should be seasonal (very few people use them in the winter), and should be strategically installed on certain streets. This bike lane removal idea is only part of the solution - help is really needed in a city that has such a dense downtown area and no real bridges to speak of.\n"

        "comment": "We are writing to express my strong opposition to the Ontario government\u2019s recent bill that would allow the province to ban and remove bike lanes.\nBike lanes are not a luxury, but a necessity for creating healthier communities, addressing climate change, and reducing congestion. Minister Prabmeet Sarkaria\u2019s claim that \u201cnot everybody can use a bike to get around\u201d ignores the crucial fact that not everyone can drive either. Young people (and those who otherwise do not have the ability to drive) deserve a safe method of getting around their communities. Bill 212 ignores their need for safe cycling infrastructure to be able to go about their daily lives.\nCars are an expensive privilege not everyone can afford. The current Ontario government claims to be focused on reducing the cost of living for Ontarians, yet seems to believe that cars should be the primary method for people to get around. Focusing on cycling and transit infrastructure would show that you actually care about lowering the cost of living for your constituents. Removing bike lanes or stifling their implementation is a step in the wrong direction, for the cost of living crisis, Ontario\u2019s transportation network, and its environmental commitments.\nBike lanes reduce the number of cars on the road by encouraging people to use sustainable modes of transportation. They are vital for providing people with safe, practical alternatives to driving. Without these alternatives, we force more people into cars, leading to more congestion, more pollution, and a less healthy population. If the goal is to make cities \u201ca better place, an easier place to get around,\u201d as Minister Sarkaria suggests, removing bike lanes will do the exact opposite.\nCycling infrastructure is a cornerstone of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. At a time when we should be ramping up efforts to combat climate change, Ontario is instead considering policies that will encourage more driving and the destruction of green spaces, as seen with the exemption of Highway 413 from the Environmental Assessment Act. This is a direct attack on our environment and flies in the face of the urgent need to lower emissions.\nCities like Vancouver have demonstrated the immense success of bike lanes in reducing congestion, improving public health, and boosting local economies. Since the introduction of protected bike lanes on streets like Burrard and Dunsmuir, cycling trips have increased dramatically, with over 100,000 bike trips counted monthly at key intersections. These bike lanes have also contributed to a significant decrease in vehicle traffic and greenhouse gas emissions, while making the streets safer for all users, including pedestrians. Vancouver\u2019s investments in cycling infrastructure have not only helped the city meet its climate goals but also fostered a more vibrant, livable urban environment. This is a clear example of how expanding, rather than removing, bike lanes can bring positive outcomes to a city\u2019s transportation system.\nCycling infrastructure, particularly the implementation of protected bike lanes, plays a critical role in increasing road safety and reducing deaths for both cyclists and pedestrians. Studies have shown that streets with dedicated bike lanes experience significantly fewer traffic collisions, as they provide clear, separate spaces for cyclists, reducing the chance of accidents with motor vehicles. In cities where bike lanes have been introduced, such as New York and Vancouver, fatalities and serious injuries involving cyclists and pedestrians have dropped dramatically. By creating a safer environment for all road users, bike lanes help prevent tragedies on our streets and make our communities more walkable, accessible, and livable. Removing or restricting bike lanes would only reverse these safety gains, putting more lives at risk.\nWe implore The current Ontario Government to recognize that the path forward is not to dismantle our existing bike lane networks but to expand them. The future of Ontario\u2019s cities depends on fostering sustainable transportation options, and bike lanes are a key part of that future. The only solution to congestion is viable alternatives to driving, and bike lanes provide one of the most effective and proven alternatives.\nWe hope The current Ontario Government will reconsider supporting this legislation and instead advocate for policies that support active transportation, protect the environment, and create healthier, more livable communities.\nWe wish to emphasize once again: The only solution to congestion is viable alternatives to driving. Removing bike lanes is an outright terrible idea that is bad for everyone.\nSincerely, a young Ontario couple who enjoy cycling\n"

        "comment": "This is an embarrassment-- a complete waste of time and money that will have the opposite effect of what is intended. We are in a climate crisis and so much data from other cities indicates that bike lanes REDUCE congestion, so I can only conclude that the actual point of this legislation is to antagonize people out of malice. People in the future will laugh with derision at this moronic bill, and will have to pay even more money when they inevitably reverse it to try and achieve the kind of better world that this current government is not interested in. Absolutely embarrassing.\n"

Bikes and bike lanes are not the issue when it comes to creating a more navigable city and reduce traffic and stress.\nPlease reconsider this and focus on alternative methods.\n"
