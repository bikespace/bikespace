        "comment": "This proposal appears to be targeting the City of Toronto for spiteful purposes.  Studies show that bike lanes and wider sidewalks improve access to businesses and do not reduce the number of people that can flow through a transportation corridor.\nPlease rescind this proposal - I am very much opposed to it.  We need more bike lanes, and they need to be on arteries that people want to travel on.\n"

        "comment": "This legislation is emblematic of the current provincial government's total inability to address the real needs of the populace. I cannot imagine a more irresponsible ignorance of essential environmental and labour standards, not to mention the completely asinine waste of resources which would be dedicated to the micromanagement of municipalities. This legislation has absolutely no business becoming law in a sane society and I would be personally curious to know who has been trying the shoelaces of the politicians who thought this was a good idea to bring to the legislature.\n"

        "comment": "I am a recreational (non commuter) cyclist and support well designed and implemented infrastructure, but the poorly conceived , designed and executed lanes on arterial roads are disastrous. I live close to the Bloor Street extension from Runnymede west and it is a complete disaster gridlocking traffic twice a day and very very little used by cyclists even in clement weather. When the subway breaks down (regularly) it is an utter end to end gridlock.\nThe times the city staff communicated at the community meeting at Etobicoke Vollegiate were a joke, rush hour commute times on that stretch have quadrupled. Why did the city remove two FULL traffic lanes? Why not one bi-directional with a centre lane that switches directions with rush-hour flow (like Jarvis) The community no longer trusts what City transportation says as its so biased and misrepresented. The trust has been broken.\n"

        "comment": "This is adding more unnecessary red tape for municipalities to build their roads, neighbourhoods, and communities. The Provincial government should leave local road design to the respective municipalities.\nThe Provincial Government should instead focus on regional transit, fixing Metrolinx to be more effective, and getting our much delayed transit projects on time and under budget. We all know that efficient transit is the best way to get people moving. Please look at precedents and data from major cities around the world.\nIf you are looking for better legislative ideas to reduce gridlock, may I suggest:\n1) higher taxes for extra-large personal vehicles and light trucks to discourage their use; as they take up more road, highway, and parking space; contributing to gridlock. Smaller cars are also more manoeverable for allowing emergency vehicles to pass.\n2) more stringent drivers licencing requirements and testing; as bad driving and road accidents cause major gridlock everywhere - from highways to local roads.\n"

        "comment": "I oppose this proposal because it is anti democratic, reduces local input into decisions that change our neighborhoods, make our roads less safe, waste tax payer dollars and increase greenhouse gases.\nIt is anti democratic and wasteful because it will override decisions made by our elected municipal government and rip out infrastructure already paid for by the municipality. Bloor street is not a highway, it\u2019s not simply for crossing the city, it is a vibrant neighborhood where people live. It\u2019s also an area where we shop and play, and the business improvement area in the annex supports the bike lanes because they improved business in the area.\nBiking has to be a part of a multi modal transportation network. We all need to be able to choose the best mode of transportation for a given trip- including walking, transit, bikes, and yes, cars too. By adding bike lanes, more Ontarians feel safe to ride. People won\u2019t start riding if they aren\u2019t safe. Side streets are not the place for bikes- we need a network that lets us get efficiently from point a to point b. Side streets are harder to navigate and are mazes of one ways.\nIf you really want to increase lanes for traffic, consider instead removing street parking. Streets should be for people to get around not for storing unmoving vehicles.\n"

It is very abhorrent to see that this is a mega/almost omnibus type Bill which is being pushed under the guise of \u201climiting bike lanes\u201d when it is serving a broader purpose of paving vital agricultural and ecological lands due to the Highway 413. Very disappointing move from the provincial government.\n"

        "comment": "I am strongly opposed to this proposal concerning municipal bike lanes.  In Kitchener, in the Region of Waterloo, where I live, planning for bike lanes and cycling routes has taken place over years and included consultation with all stakeholders.  Plans have been made in order to preserve efficient car and bus travel through the cities of the region.  I have driven in this Region for 30 years and have experienced no disadvantage as the bike lanes have been added.  The  lanes are planned so that cycling routes are connected throughout the region and, as the number of cyclists has increased, car traffic congestion has not.  In such matters, on which only local municipal governments hold expertise and ability to plan,  the involvement of the Provincial government is completely unhelpful and inappropriate.\n"

        "comment": "I am completely against ripping up bike lanes. It will not reduce traffic, and will just cause induced demand - meaning that gridlock may ease at first, but as it does so will the number of people driving increase, and we\u2019ll be in the exact same boat. Toronto has come so far in terms of bike infrastructure and usage has grown significantly every year. I pay an insane amount for rent in this city, and for the priorities of suburbanites that don\u2019t even live here be put over the wishes of locals is heartbreaking. The amount of food delivery drivers that rely on bike lanes cannot be understated, and their use of the bike lanes is a win for all. If bike lanes do get ripped out, the death of the cyclists that will come from collisions are on the hands of Doug Ford and Prabmeet Sarkaria.\n"

        "comment": "There is a sore lack of logic behind the proposal to remove existing (some, brand new) bike lanes in the city of Toronto, where an overwhelming amount of Torontonians do not drive or own their own vehicle/have parking space, cannot or would rather not rely solely on our (underfunded and unsafe) public transit system, and can (and do) make use of the accessible, low cost, healthy, non-intrusive transit option that is cycling. Looking to all other growing city centres of the world, the trend is towards cycling and similar modes of transport, and trending away from increased motor vehicle use, for obvious reasons. There is no question that, as a city grows and the number of people per square kilometre climbs, a car (that most often is only holding one person) is the least efficient method of moving people, compared to a bus, subway car, or bike lane. Lastly, I\u2019ll point out that the Ontario Government is attempting to punch their way into intracity transit, where it has no business being. Stay in your lane.\n"

        "comment": "As someone who has bike commuted for 25 years, the growing trend of protected bike lanes has been welcome. Bike lanes, like all infrastructure should be well planned. In my experience, good local planning happens when it is directed from the local level. The bike lanes here in London have made a significant difference to may safety as a cyclist and have had no meaningful impact of my ability to drive through the city. Yes, driving through London is miserable, but this is related to population growth and few alternatives to driving. Furthermore, all the research suggests that bike lanes make good economic sense for local businesses. I have real concern that this legislation will hamper local business, make cycling less safe, cost significant tax dollars, and lead to almost no change in congestion on our streets. If the province wants to be helpful on bike lanes, develop informed best practices that will use bike lanes strategically to reduce the number of people on our roads and drive up profits of businesses for whom the presence of bike lanes has often led to economic growth. Yes, curmudgeonly neighbours don\u2019t like the looks of them, but they are demonstrated to be effective and keep people safe. This legislation works against that.\n"

Pushing cyclists back into regular traffic is an awful idea.\nIt is clear that the Ford Government doesn't understand the simple concept of \"induced demand\". Adding more lanes does NOT solve traffic. Only investing in alternative means of public transit solves traffic, and cycling lanes is a core part of that. Cycling lanes also makes our cities more pleasant and approachable for pedestrians, less polluted, and less noisy.\n"

        "comment": "This does not seem, to me, to be a proposal made in good faith to benefit drivers in Ontario. Were it truly the case that the objective is reducing gridlock, the actions that the province proposes should effectively reduce the high number of cars on the road - the precise cause for gridlock in the first place.\nRemoving bike lanes WILL result in more bikes in car lanes which does not serve the objective of reducing gridlock.\nShould cyclists be dissuaded from cycling they may instead opt to commute by car, adding more cars on the road, which does not serve the objective of reducing gridlock.\nAdding more traffic lanes in service of reducing gridlock is not sustainable either. If the province prioritizes infrastructure for driving over other alternatives, will this lessen or grow the number of cars on the road over time?\nPlease consider the perspective that gridlock can be reduced sustainably by, instead, investing in infrastructure that makes alternative modes of commuting - cycling, public transit, walking, and so on - more appealing than driving. This is how we can effectively reduce gridlock in Ontario without stripping vital, modern transportation infrastructure.\n"

        "comment": "We need safer streets which means less highways, and less vehicle lanes. Cities should be walkable our reliance on cars is ridiculous and more lanes doesn't mean less traffic. It just means more congestion and more cars. We need streets where we consider transportation BESIDES cars. So walking, cycling, jogging. the Ontario Government has no business getting involved in how cities operate bike lanes. Toronto is so congested and instead of finishing the many transit projects it's ridiculous that the Ontario Government wants to get involved by adding more construction which is already bad for the environment. In fact the provincial government should be giving more funding to cities to improve their biking lanes and improve accessibility for families to travel by foot without having to depend on cars. I DO NOT agree with giving the Ontario Government more power, cities and municipal governments should not have to consult with the Ontario government.\n"

        "comment": "This framework, while representing an unreasonable overreach of the provincial government into municipal affairs as well as running contrary to the mandate of the Minister of Red Tape Reduction, is also premised on faulty information not supported by any evidence whatsoever.\nThe capacity of a roadway of mixed traffic is between 600 and 1600 passengers per hour. Given that for free flowing traffic, a lane occupancy of 12 cars per lane per mile (7.44 cars per lane per km) is required, and the average car occupancy is 1.4 persons, this means that the capacity of a free-flowing roadway occupied by cars is 10.46 persons per km per lane. At a speed limit of 50km/h, this results in a capacity of ~500 people per hour.\nBy comparison, a bike lane has a capacity of 7500-12000 persons per hour, depending on the width of the lane, making it far more efficient than a vehicle lane, with public transport coming in at higher capacities.\nGiven the above data, by removing or preventing bicycle lanes, the government would be actively increasing traffic congestion by reducing mode shift, as removing other options for transport forces people to use cars as a sole method of transportation, which will naturally be far in excess of the 500 persons per hour limit of free-flowing traffic.\nThe effect of this framework would be the exact opposite of its stated effect, and should not be adopted.\n"
