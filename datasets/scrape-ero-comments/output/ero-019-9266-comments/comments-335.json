        "comment": "I DO NOT SUPPORT removing existing bike lanes in Toronto or any other municipality. Further, I do not support the Government of Ontario overseeing future bike lane construction in Toronto.\n1. Removing existing infrastructure will create new construction headaches.\n2. Removing existing infrastructure will release carbon to the atmosphere.\n3. Removing existing infrastructure costs money.\n4. Toronto vetted its bike lanes. They work. Ridership is up from 665 000 riders in 2017 to 5.7 million in 2023.\n5. Remove STREET PARKING on major arterial roads which are meant to MOVE PEOPLE. Bike lanes are travel lanes that move people.\n6. I support CONGESTION PRICING like seen in London and New York City. We need this sort of pricing especially now with the planned development at Ontario Place - it has always been a traffic nightmare to drive there and I would point out, there are no bike lanes impacting that congestion.\n7. Bike lanes provide the MISSING LINK between transit and final destinations - this is key to the success of public transit.\n"

Leave the bike lanes alone and focus on Healthcare, schools, etc.  You are putting people who ride bikes at risk.  An unnecessary risk.  Stay out of city policies.\n"

        "comment": "I live in Toronto and I drive a car 90% of the time. However, the areas in which the Ontario government is proposing closing the bike lanes (Yonge St, University Ave, Bloor Street) are areas in which I use TTC or walk or ride a bike.\nContinuing to have the downtown areas fully accessible by car is not feasible, is environmentally unsound and not sustainable with the increasing population in Toronto.  Bike riding is a healthier option - physical activity leads to better health which leads to less money required for healthcare services.\nI understand the need for commercial vehicles having access to these areas, hence the remaining vehicular lanes in these areas can be used for their purposes.\nFrankly, although Bill 212 alludes to the Ontario Highway Traffic Act, I am of the opinion that it's really nothing more than Premier Ford involving himself in a matter that is more of a municipal affair.\nSection 2 of the Reducing Gridlock Act provides an exemption from the Environmental Assessment Act \"for enterprises, activities, proposals, plans and programs for or related to Highway 413, including the Highway 413 Project and the Highway 413 early works projects.\" Again, another ploy by Premier Ford to insert his lack of concern for environmental procedures which will have a disastrous outcome for the environment.\nThis Bill should not move further. It will provide opposite effects - gridlock will increase, public health and safety will be harmed and it will destroy the environment.\nI am more than willing to give my $200.00 'rebate' from Premier Ford, to go towards much more needed areas in which the Conservatives should be focusing their time: providing affordable apartments/housing (without putting the money in the hands of their developer buddies) reducing grocery prices and concentrating on densifying the downtown core so people can more easily commute rather than taking their cars.\nPlease, please stop Bill 212 from moving forward.\n"

It seems like nothing you choose for us align with what we want or will actually result in improvements. It's so annoying.\nIn the case of Bill 212 it literally goes against facts! Removing critical bike lanes like those proposed in Toronto and prohibiting future ones across the province will lead to increased gridlock of CARS and will not save time.\nI'd like to be able to drive my car and get somewhere when needed, please. I don't want everyone driving if they don't have to so that when I do need to use a car to drive somewhere there will be less traffic and I can move in my car safely without bikes in my lane unnecessarily! They will slow my commute down and make it more likely I'll hit them accidentally.\nVote NO to Bill 212. It will just make things worse!\n"

        "comment": "To whom it may concern:\nI am a physician working at St. Joseph's Health Centre, but living in the East End of Toronto. The Bloor bike lane has been an integral part of how I get to work every day as a frontline healthcare worker. It helped me avoid the crowded subway so that I did not get sick myself and could continue my healthcare work; it helped me avoid multiple TTC closures this year so I could get to work on time and not have to cancel appointments; it helped me get home safely at night after a 14 hour call shift without being afraid of being hit by a car on my way home. Its closure would force me to use the Lakeshore bike lane, which, while safe, is not cleared in the winter and has no winter maintenance requirements. This would force me back onto the subway in the middle of flu, COVID, and RSV season, increasing the potential of me having to miss work due to illness.\nAround the world, bike lanes have actually contributed to reduced gridlock and traffic, and have taken cars off the road, improving the environment and reducing traffic at the same time. It is ill-informed to believe that adding more car lanes will reduce congestion, as this has been disproven time and time again, especially with the widening of Toronto's highways.\nI am not the only healthcare worker in this predicament -- I am pleading with you to see the importance of this bike lane to the functioning of our hospitals and our city. I am pleading with you to read the dozens of studies that have been done around the world demonstrating the importance of bike lanes on major streets, and how they have been extremely helpful to the cities that implemented them.\n"

        "comment": "I live downtown near Bloor Street, and I actually drive more often than I bike. Nevertheless, I condemn Doug Ford\u2019s personal vendetta against Toronto\u2019s bike lane infrastructure. The vast majority of urban planners and traffic experts, people who trust data and not just their gut, agree that bike lanes reduce congestion and make streets safer for pedestrians, cyclists and drivers alike. As someone who sometimes drives Toronto\u2019s streets, I appreciate the separation of bikes from cars on the roads. I don\u2019t have to creep along behind hoards of bike riders, nor do I have to deal with the unpredictable behaviours of riders dodging between cars and hiding in my blind spots. Removing existing bike lanes will only ensure that drivers are slowed down and that more riders will lose their lives. That last part might not mean anything to someone who doesn\u2019t have neighbours, family and friends who ride, but I do. There is a ghost bike memorial up the street from my house already, and I am not keen to see even more.  In addition, removing existing bike lanes will be a wasteful endeavour on top of what we as a province have already wasted breaking contracts (e.g., alcohol sales) and selling off land (Ontario Place) for the benefit of Ford\u2019s cronies. The idea of adding even more red tape for cities to improve infrastructure by making them get approval to add bike lanes is a blatant power grab. So much for small government! Instead of constantly trying to be mayor of Toronto, which we have already rejected, Ford should spend OUR money on the things we actually lack, such as access to public healthcare, daycare, addiction programs, affordable housing and public transit. If Ford wants to be mayor that badly, he can run again. Until then, he should stay in his lane.\n"

For 8 months of the year I commute to my office by bike, saving me money and giving me exercise. Please don't take this away. Let cities think through their infrastructure - the province should be thinking about highways and the like.\nWe need more commuting options in Toronto, not less. If the province wants to fund more public transit that connects ontario to toronto I'm all for it - there are currently 0 go trains that leave Toronto in the mornings and connect to other hubs like waterloo for example. That seems like a much more worthwhile project to spend time and money on. Get ontarians moving across ontario more easily please!\n"

        "comment": "I am a lifelong cyclist and driver in downtown Toronto. My experience has been that the safer the bike lane, the more users there are. Likewise, the wider and more plentiful the car lanes, the traffic is faster and and of higher volume. In my neighborhood in Little Italy, the bike lanes are packed at rush hours. I think the impression of empty bike lanes is caused by the size difference between vehicles, ratio of 4 bikes to 1 car.\nOff topic, what I really wish is that the streetcar would be treated like blood in our veins. You got to keep it moving at all costs. Like in New York, car travel should be slow and comfortable and transit should be full and fast.\nThank you\n"

This would align with the province\u2019s commitment to reducing carbon emissions and encourage active transportation. This bill is the opposite of those goals. It encourages more traffic by prioritizing vehicles and making citizens that choose other forms of transportation less efficient and more dangerous. This bill will make cycling in Toronto more dangerous.\n"

Pilots in other Canadian cities, such as Montreal, show that bike lanes remove cars from roads, thus easing congestion, to say nothing of the improved health and environmental benefits of active transportation. In a basic sense, bikes take much less space than cars, and most cars have a single occupant, so swapping cars for bikes alleviates traffic.\nSecond, Toronto is a city full of cyclists, and removing dedicated bike lanes will simply make things more dangerous - and there are already too many injuries and deaths for cyclists. Also, downtown Toronto, including Bloor, just got extensive additional dedicated bike lanes - why throw away money by removing them?\nThird, Bill 212 adds an addendum exempting Highway 413 from needing to follow the Environmental Assessment Act - why is this included? Find it here:\nhttps://www.ola.org/en/legislative-business/bills/parliament-43/session\u2026\nThis is dishonest and dangerous - massive infrastructure projects should need to ensure that future Ontarians have a health natural environment.\n"
