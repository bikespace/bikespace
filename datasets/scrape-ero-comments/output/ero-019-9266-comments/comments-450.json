        "comment": "I strongly oppose Bill 212. It represents a massive overreach of the provincial government's power. The province should not be stepping in and blocking construction of or removing bike lanes in cities, as they are valuable transportation infrastructure. Bicycle lanes save lives, help businesses, and provide residents with reliable transportation options. This bill would be a massive step backwards for making transportation efficient and reliable, because more bicycle infrastructure ultimately means more people will opt to bike rather than drive, in turn reducing congestion on roads. It simply doesn't make sense for the provincial government to be wasting time and taxpayer money meddling in municipal infrastructure projects like bike lanes, which have been shown around the world to be a net-benefit for transportation in countless cities. Let local voters decide how their cities should be built. The province does not adequately represent local municipal voters and does not understand our local needs. We need safe and expansive bicycle infrastructure.\nIn addition, rather than attempting to spend billions of dollars on car infrastructure by continually expanding highways (despite the fact that these projects always end up inducing more driver demand and thus likely making car traffic worse in the long run), we would be much better served by investing in public transit infrastructure, which \"pays dividends\" in the long run by reducing the amount of people who need to drive a car every day, freeing up our existing roads, while making transportation more accessible to those for whom driving is not a viable option. This demographic includes children, seniors, people who cannot afford to own a car, people living with disabilities, and more. In short; Bill 212 works against the best interests of Ontarians.\nWhen bike lanes get better there will only be more bikers and it will fix everything. When the bike lanes are properly in place bikers will also be more incline to follow the rules instead of switching between a vehicle to a pedestrian on a bike\n"

        "comment": "while i think the city of Toronto has lacked strategy and commons sense when placing bike lanes in the city - i DO NOT believe it is a good use of resources to remove the ones that are already there unless there are SERIOUS issues ( i.e. emergency vehicles cannot pass, etc.); if the Ontario government is serious about supporting Toronto traffic, they would support better transit rather than making deals to build large parking structures at luxury spas. Leave the bike lanes as is but change the policies so new bike lanes are added more strategically\nALSO- as a driver and pedestrian, I strongly recommend considering licensing bikes. The number of reckless and aggressive bicyclists is increasing. Even with protected Bike lanes, cyclists do not obey the rules of the road, run red lights and very often swerving out of their bike lanes into car traffic- it is unmanageable and dangers. Bikes should have the same responsibilities as any other vehicle on the road.\nFinally- if the city would like to get strategic about bike lanes, all future bike lanes should be winter proofed by having headed pavement so snow does not stay on the lanes. This would allow for bike lane use throughout the winter.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly disagree with both the intent and implementation of this bill. Getting to the point of removing individual bike lanes constitutes major overreach by the provincial government in municipal affairs, and tearing out built bike lanes is a terrible waste of money. Forcing new bike lanes to be approved by the Minister of Transportation adds a ridiculous amount of red tape and will lead to far fewer bike lanes being approved province wide, for reasons that cannot possibly take into account the needs of individual municipalities. Furthermore, it is doubtful that this will in reality save anyone time, instead forcing ever more people into cars, creating more gridlock and emissions. Bike lanes also require much less maintenance than car lanes, so this will also result in higher costs being borne by the taxpayer. I am very disappointed in this bill, which is far more about optics and enabling government bureaucracy than it is in improving the lives of Ontarians.\n"

As a physician, I am fully aware of the growing obesity rates and regular exercise benefits. Not only am I concerned about my own health, but I also wish to be a role model to my patients. I cycle to work whenever the weather permits.\nAside from its health benefits, cycling is an enjoyable activity. Yet, during rush hours in Toronto, cycling is mostly nerve-racking. I am constantly concerned about speedy and irresponsible drivers taking advantage of cyclists to gain an extra minute at the expense of my safety.\nFrom this perspective, bike lanes are vital in a city like Toronto. I would not cycle to work (and drive instead, adding one more car to the traffic jams) if it were not for the wonderful Bloor Street and University Avenue bike lanes that allow me to do so.\nAs a Conservative-minded physician, I urge Mr. Ford and his government to reconsider the plans to remove the main bike lanes in Toronto. This is a great mistake that will not guarantee the PC more votes, but discourage conservative voters like my like-minded friends and colleagues from supporting the party at the next election.\nThere is much that the PC government can do to strengthen voters' support (healthcare investments being the most important cause). Removing bike lanes is not a wise or strategically good choice.\nI count on Mr. Ford's government to change Bill 212 to delete its bike lanes' proposed changes.\nThank you for the opportunity to contribute.\n"

I don't ever bike and bike lanes are an absolute requirement and necessity for the safety of citizens, for the ability for people to choose their own mode of transportation, and to actually Reduce road traffic overall.\nThe bike lanes on Bloor, University and Yonge should all remain and if not, be further upgraded.\nBike lanes need to be upgraded throughout the city and more added throughout.\nPeople have the right to choose their mode of transportation, and with upgrades throughout the GTA to bike paths and public transportation it will give people the ability to choose.\nYou don't see many people biking because the lanes and infrastructure isn't completed and is dangerous because of poor bike infrastructure.\nDo not pass this bill. It's an absolute waste of money just like the rest of your stupid political stunts.\nYou realize the $3Billion you're giving back to people could hire thousands of doctors, teachers, could build hundreds or thousands of homes or rental apartments?

        "comment": "I am opposed to the entirety of the Bill 212 proposal in which \"The framework would enable provincial approval for new bike lanes on municipal roads requiring removal of a traffic lane and for existing ones, where a traffic lane was removed; it also provides for the removal of the bike lanes on Bloor St., Yonge St., and University Ave. in the City of Toronto and to return them to a lane of traffic.\" Cutting down an integral means of transportation that is economical for those who cannot afford vehicles and fundamentally better for the environment will not solve the traffic crisis in Ottawa. Much research has been done into road design that reduces traffic; look at the Netherlands, for example; the leading solution is higher volume and higher quality public transit solutions. In other words, moving more people more frequently = more transport in less time. That would solve the crisis, not the removal of bike lanes, not increasing lanes or the size of the road. Consider other alternatives before striking the heart of public transit for those who use bikes: students, area locals who don't need a car to drive within short distances, children, the elderly, those who like exercise, people who commute to work, people who commute to friends and family. Bikes aren't just a rich man's pastime; bikes are how people get around without forking hundreds of dollars in gas every week to get from suburbia to downtown. Improve the downtown core with more bike lanes, reduce road widths, and generate more reliable public transit infrastructure, and more people would be willing to use it. Cutting costs by making bad trains or removing infrastructure disincentivizes all those things. It pushes more people to drive their 6-seater vehicles with one person at the wheel and nobody else in the car- the epitome of less efficiency, making more traffic.\n"

        "comment": "The proposed Bill is a step backwards in improving traffic flow in Toronto and the rest of Ontario. Adding extra lanes to a road or highway does not improve traffic conditions for drivers and does not address the root of the problem. Improving public transit and encouraging a shift to active transportation, for example by adding separated bike lanes, will help alleviate vehicle traffic. Removing bike lanes does not stop people biking, but does make biking significantly more unsafe. Transportation is one of the biggest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions in Canada, and removing the safe and environmentally friendly alternative of using separated bike lanes means that we will be contributing more to climate change. The GTA is already seeing the impacts of a changing climate, such as increased frequency and severity of flooding and extreme weather events. Removing bike lanes that have already been built is a gross mismanagement of tax payer money. Money that would be better used on a number of initiatives that could help the city and the province prepare for the future instead of moving backwards. This could include improving public transit so less people are reliant on driving for their commute, improving resilience to a changing climate so we're not spending millions of dollars on rebuilding after costly flooding events, and building more separated bike lanes so Ontarians have a safe and environmentally friendly transportation alternative.\n"

I  drive down Hatt Street frequently and rarely see a bike rider on either of the 2 bike lanes . There are many condos in area and there is one lane each way on the street for  cars. I think it is a waste of taxpayer money to put in lanes that are rarely used and in high traffic areas just for the sake of providing bike lanes. Plus the cost of upkeep and snow removal with specialized equipment. Canada towns and cities were not set up like Europe and Hamilton and Dundas are not flat like Amsterdam.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose Ontario Bill 212 (Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024) for several key reasons. The idea that removing bike lanes will alleviate traffic is flawed and lacks evidence. Studies and historical data indicate that removing bike lanes tends to worsen, not improve, traffic congestion. This approach could also increase accidents and fatalities, ultimately raising costs for healthcare, emergency response, and legal systems.\nAs a Toronto resident, I\u2019ve adapted to the city\u2019s needs by choosing cycling for health, savings, and reduced gridlock. I recently moved into a house on Dundas street where there are essential bike routes to avoid car reliance. This proposal, however, penalizes my choices and heightens my risk of injury.\nThe Bloor-Danforth, College, Dundas and  University Ave corridors are ideal for bike infrastructure, spanning the city east to west, north to south. Removing bike lanes will only increase gridlock by encouraging more cars, not solving the problem. Side streets aren\u2019t a safe or effective alternative to cross major intersections like the Bloor Viaduct.\nRather than putting in more redtape and bureaucracy that may compromise public safety and weaken urban infrastructure, Ontario should prioritize finish building the long overdue and over budget Eglington Crosstown LRT, and put more investments in areas like healthcare and education, which directly benefit residents. These investments would better serve the long-term needs of Ontarians than dismantling bike lanes for the sake of traffic flow.\nToronto isn\u2019t just a pass-through for drivers; it\u2019s where we live. We need infrastructure that serves locals, not just those passing through. I will never support or vote for anyone who champions this flawed proposal.\n"

As a cyclist, I've found myself cycling more because of the bike lanes. I feel safe and protected. We need more bike lanes, not less. The city needs to evolve into the future, not take a step back into the past. This bill does not represent folks living IN the city. It is not for folks living in the downtown core and it will impact our lives more than anyone else.\n"

These lanes are essential for residents' health, safety, and financial well-being. Bike lanes encourage physical activity, which improves public health and lowers healthcare costs by promoting a more active lifestyle. They also make Toronto\u2019s streets safer for cyclists and pedestrians by reducing collisions and creating a predictable flow of traffic.\nAdditionally, bike lanes allow residents to avoid the high costs of car ownership, from gas to maintenance and insurance. With a bike, I can sustainably manage my finances, living within my means without relying on a car. Removing bike lanes limits these choices and pushes more people into vehicle dependency, which is neither financially nor environmentally sustainable.\nPlease reconsider removing these critical resources that contribute to a healthier, safer, and more affordable Toronto.\n"
