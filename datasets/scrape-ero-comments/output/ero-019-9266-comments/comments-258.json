        "comment": "I accept that it's the province's right to manage city affairs as they see fit. My concern with this bill is in the summary- \"It would also provide the ability to compel municipalities to collect and provide information to the province on existing bike lanes where a lane of traffic was removed.\" If there's evidence that bike lanes have reduced congestion in the city, my understanding is that the bike lanes would be removed regardless. Why would the position of the government then be to increase congestion in the city while the name of the act is \"Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time\"?\nAs someone who drives for work I am concerned about the government increasing my time on the road.\n"

        "comment": "Please re-consider the bike lane portion of Bill 212.  It is incomplete and appears to be rushed to print as the specified criteria have not been stated.   How can anyone comment fully when all the facts are unavailable?  This framework needs much more work before becoming part of any bill.\nBike lanes are clearly a municipal decision, whether to add or remove.  The provincial government has no knowledge of municipal requirements and no right to override decisions by elected local City Councils.  Any attempt to meddle by the provincial government is clearly an over-reach of power.\nThe removal of existing bike lanes is hazardous for motorists and cyclists who are now accustomed to the routes.  Additionally, there will be environmental damage as lanes are torn up and heavy construction equipment emits more GHGs, in addition to the extra vehicular traffic.  This will lead to more gridlock as road construction crews throughout the municipality will close roads and limit traffic.\nThis bill inflicts more costs on taxpayers who are already overburdened and requires extra work by municipal employees who are already overworked.  There is not one single advantage to anyone in any municipality.\nLastly, it would be helpful if the province were aware of its own regulations:  1)  bike lanes cannot be built on provincial highways and these are the main thoroughfares which most motorists use and 2) by law, a cyclist is entitled to a full lane on our Ontario roads.\nThe bike lanes protect the cyclists and the motorists and decrease the number of accidents/fatalities that would otherwise be caused.\nPlease take time to consider the gridlock if every cyclist exercised their right to a full lane and rode down the middle of the road, blocking all motorists behind them.\nAlso, please consider the road rage and deaths if cyclists are forced to exercise their rights because the safety of bike lanes was denied them by the provincial government.  Lives are in your hands.  People are more important than Bill 212.\n"

        "comment": "If we, as residents, have elected a mayor or city councilor to represent our interests, and we want bike lanes in our neighborhood because we see them as necessary, and as the  needed solution to address gridlock why should the province interfere? The province doesn\u2019t necessarily understand the specific needs of our community when it comes to addressing traffic issues; our elected city councilor and mayor do.  To address our local traffic issues, sometimes a road is needed, other times a bike lane is required, and at other times it is public transit . Often a measured combination of all three is necessary. We may already have one or more of these options, but we often need more of one in particular to effectively tackle the specific issue our  neighbourhood is incountering. As members of thecommunity, we are better equipped than the province to understand which option is needed to meet our specific needs. Why undermine our democratically elected officials by preventing them from acting on the will of the people who elected them and actually tackling  the transit issues of  the community?\n"

        "comment": "Supporting cycling in a major city like Toronto is one of the best ways to reduce the number of cars on the road\u2014too many cars is the CAUSE of gridlock. Therefore, it makes no sense to restrict the creation of bike lanes where they take a lane away from motor vehicles. Spatially, more bikes can fit in that lane than cars, and the more people cycle the less cars there are on the road.\nTo make travel more efficient in Toronto, we cannot rely on cars. We need to transition to cycling and transit. We need push and pull factors to do this. Gridlock is pushing people away from using cars, and fast, safe, reliable cycling and transit infrastructure are the pull factors. Toronto\u2019s pull factors are weak and need investment, but this bill would make traffic worse AND reduce cycling infrastructure. It therefore is a silly and poorly thought out idea.\n"

The safety of cyclists should not be an afterthought to a slight inconvenience to drivers, who are sitting safe and secure in their vehicles.\nCyclists have a right to safe, efficient transportation, and these bike lanes on major roadways have been an incredible boon to safety, and getting more people out of cars and onto other modes of transportation - which is really the ONLY true method of improving traffic.\nIt sickens me that Doug Ford and his government could be so callous to even consider putting cyclists at risk again. I am primarily a driver in Toronto, and would like to see these bike lanes remain, to keep my fellow citizens safe, and make active transportation a viable option to those who can use it.\n"

This was the comment made when the issues of housing came up, one that not wanting to overstep into municipal territory was used as the primary reasoning for not pushing housing reform further. Now it seems when it comes to municipal roadways, the opposite is true, and municipal jurisdiction no longer matters when it comes to wanting to remove transportation options from the citizens of Ontario.\n"

However, it won't actually solve the problem, and moves backwards in so many other ways.\nThis isn't smart, or based in research at all.\n"

This proposal, which will make it more difficult to expand bike lane infrastructure, will do nothing but spend unnecessary taxpayer dollars, increase safety risks for existing and new cyclists, and increase cars on the road (and hence reduce air quality and environmental safety).\nI believe a much more useful provincial intervention into municipal transportation services would be to spend this money on further improving public transit infrastructure and access, which will in turn improve the traffic experience of drivers who are unable to use alternative modes of transportation.\n"

        "comment": "As a resident of Toronto, I am opposed to Bill 212 for many reasons, but I want to focus my comment today on two things.\nFirst, I want to debunk the myth that bike lanes cause traffic congestion. There is no evidence to suggest that bike lanes cause or increase traffic congestion. That idea, the entire foundation for Bill 212, is simply not true. There is lots of evidence to the contrary. Please at least read the linked CBC article. There are also longer reports linked within the article, if you want to learn more. I want to be very concise and clear: bike lanes ease traffic congestion. They do not cause congestion, and they do not make congestion worse. Once again: bike lanes ease traffic congestion.\nSecond, regardless of their impact on commute times, bike lanes save lives. Streets with bike lanes are far safer than streets without them, not only for cyclists, but also for drivers and pedestrians. Removing existing bike lanes or blocking new ones in Toronto, or anywhere else in Ontario, will only lead to more reckless, high-speed driving. I seldom see eye-to-eye with Premier Ford, but I agree when he said: \u201cWe have to make sure there is never a death in the city. One death is way too many when it comes to bicycle riders,\u201d but I would add that the same is true for drivers and pedestrians as well.\nTo summarize, passing Bill 212, removing any existing bike lanes, or blocking new ones, will increase traffic congestion, and senselessly endanger countless lives every single day. By voting \u201cyes\u201d to Bill 212, you will kill people. You will kill cyclists, you will kill drivers, you will kill passengers, and you will kill pedestrians. I hope that this Bill is voted down, but if it passes, those of you who vote \u201cyes\u201d will be directly responsible for these deaths. I urge every MPP voting on Bill 212, protect public safety, protect your constituents\u2019 safety, and vote \u201cno\u201d to Bill 212.\n"

        "comment": "The removal of bike lanes is an overreach by this province that will worsen traffic conditions. It strips away the right for cyclists to use alternative transportation, disregarding those who prefer not to drive. This approach feels stuck in a 1950s mindset.\nEliminating bike lanes will likely lead to more injuries for cyclists, as drivers will be forced to maneuver around them, increasing the risks. Additionally, cycling benefits the environment and promotes better health.\nRegarding Highway 413, it threatens greenbelt and farmland and is unnecessary given the existing 407. Claims that it will save drivers over 30 minutes are misleading, and the actual costs will far exceed estimates. This project will only encourage urban sprawl and car dependency.\nInstead, we should prioritize better public transit and improved healthcare. It's time to stop catering to developers.\n"

Investment in public transit at the intra and inter-region level and local bike infrastructure is much more efficient at moving people than in infrastructure for cars that typically only carry one passenger.\nReducing the power of local municpal government to chose their own solutions to such local concerns will make the problem impossible to deal with efficiently.\n"

        "comment": "I am highly in favour in my support of the removal of bike lanes on major arterial roads where it makes the most sense...by which I mean those roadways that have been reduced drastically down to one lane in each direction to accommodate these bike lanes and which are not even being used by Cyclists.  For example roads like Eglinton Avenue East and Eglinton Avenue West as well as Cummer Avenue in North York.  There is a major uptick in congestion on these roads now that was not there prior and I should know as I have lived by both over the years and witnessed the upheaval to all of them.  Each one of these roads have TTC Bus routes on them in which the buses are now being held up in major congestion and it is majorly impacting the travel time for those Commuters.  Meaning that it is not the better way for those stuck on the bus.  Cummer Avenue has the largest bike lanes on them that I have ever seen and this does not make any sense not when not being used at all and when it has has reduced the roadway down to one lane in each direction, and have taken out turn lanes for both cars and the buses to enter to move out of through traffic.  Because of that point alone there is now traffic on the stretch of Cummer between Leslie and Bayview over to Yonge that I have never ever seen before.  There are also a great many schools on them meaning the Bus is always full all day every day of the week and those Commuters who have to take the Bus are being heavily impacted as well as the uptick in traffic just idling on this road adding to the gas emissions.  Not to mention those rushing to get around it now entering and speeding down the Residential side streets off of Cummer and Bayview just to avoid it all.  Those residential side streets where people live with their families and young children putting them in harm's way.  But worse of all it means that the Ambulance and Fire Trucks located on Bayview Avenue are no longer even able to get around on those roadways to respond to those homes on the side streets nor the Long Term Care Homes located all along Cummer AVenue.  Putting people's lives at risk when every minute counts.  If you are a resident paying a lot of taxes living on this street and off of Cummer it means no longer even being able to get out of your driveway or your side street.  Those bike lanes I believe were put on that roadway to make it safer for drivers but it is actually very much more dangerous as all of us Pedestrians and Drivers can see.  To turn right from Leslie onto Cummer means you are basically up on the curve of the bike lane.  To turn left as well from Leslie onto Cummer is very precarious as well as you are trying to turn into a narrow lane of traffic trying to avoid a head on collision with the other lane of traffic.  The buses have no room within their lane of travel given their size of vehicle as well as trucks meaning they have no choice but to road the centre line into approaching oncoming traffic.  Then as the bus stops to let people on and off drivers are now rushing to go around it once again attempting to pass like this can lead to many head on collisions.  And the worst is in the winter when ice and snow is piled up on the sides of it and there is no room to maneouver leading to many an accident.  So removing these are narrowing the bike lanes on Cummer Avenue should be the first priority.  Thank you for your consideration.\n"

I have chosen to live in Ottawa because I like to bike and it is a reason Ottawa is attractive to so many.

You should be encouraging multi-modal transit options, not trying to get everyone back into their cars. True freedom in transportation is having choice about how you want to get around, all of which options should be safe and affordable. This government has not put forward any evidence that proves removing bike lanes (especially ones from dense urban areas) would have any positive effect on the communities they actually pass through, and frankly it scares me to think about biking alongside motor traffic on roads like Bloor and University in Toronto. The government also needs to understand that bike-able streets create a more pleasant urban environment that encourages economic activity. Beyond my personal fears behind this proposal, mostly for my own safety, is that this proposal seems like a gross over-reach of the province into municipal affairs.\n"
