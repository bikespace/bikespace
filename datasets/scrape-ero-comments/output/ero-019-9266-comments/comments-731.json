        "comment": "Ontario\u2019s suburban-based drivers already now pay far less than their fair share of expenses in Toronto to pay for new infrastructure, infrastructure maintenance, road safety, traffic management, and accident cleanup in the city.\nAlong major TTC subway and dedicated streetcar routes (Bloor-Danforth, Yonge-University-Vaughn-Finch, St Clair, Spadina, Queen, King) there should be sufficient access for emergency vehicles and law enforcement vehicles; all other motor vehicles should pay a metered (time of day and trip length) charge for using those roads. This includes all private vehicles and delivery vehicles, including taxis and Uber, with separate arrangements for disabled travelers. Daily vehicle travel by vehicles based outside of metropolitan Toronto should be assessed charges at least double the charges assessed on Toronto residents.\nBike lanes seem to have improved safety on the roads, both between bikes and pedestrians and between bikes and motor vehicles. They may be necessary but are not sufficient to reduce congestion and to recover the fair charges for the costs imposed by suburban drivers.\n"

        "comment": "This proposed bill is a disappointing government overreach by a premier who promised small government and financial responsibility but insists upon wasting tax dollars by fixating on interfering with a single municipality.\nI urge our provincial government to pay attention to experts. Bike lanes along Bloor-danforth and in the downtown core have resulted in more patronage to local businesses, reduced response times from emergency services and lower congestion. Invest the estimated $48 million into public transit infrastructure (like finishing the crosstown lrt).\nThe added schedule exempting highway 413 from environmental assessment is inexcusable. Premier Ford campaigned on the promise of leaving the green belt untouched. Development in our farmlands will only lead to higher food costs and additional flooding as we saw this past summer. This proposed exemption buried in the bill is underhanded and disgusting.\nThe dishonesty and disregard for the lives and wellbeing of working ontarians will be remembered come election time.\n"

Our cities cannot be centralized only in cars. We gotta support alternative ways.\nI live in downtown Toronto - I don\u2019t own a car simply for the fact it\u2019s not worth all the expenses (own a car in my area just for parking would cost me at least $500 monthly).\nI use bikes, including a membership to city bikes, get to places quicker than any car or other alternative (including ttc).\nThis law also cross the lines of province and municipalities responsabilties - but other than that, put cars on the center of transit (which is already failed) and regress in guaranteeing the safety of many bikers in the city.\nA government that care about urban development would never consider such bill.\nWe gotta evolve, we gotta move forward and create solutions for a new sustainable world.\nCancel this bill. Focus on real problems, and real solutions.\nThank you\n"

Congestion will be the same or worse. Removing the bike lanes will put more cyclists in traffic, putting their lives at risk.

The same amount of traffic will exist, and yet bikers will be placed in a more dangerous position as a result.

        "comment": "I see this bill addendum as a horrible decision and a backwards step for the province to be taking. The bike lanes on Bloor and University are essential infrastructure that I use daily and their removal would put the basic safety of cyclists at risk.\nThe removal of these well used, protected bike lanes would be a huge waste of taxpayer money and would not result in a reduction of gridlock as proposed by the bill. When there are more lanes of traffic, more cars flock to those roads and the gridlock persists. Alternative travel options, such as biking and public transit, are the answer to traffic reduction - not the removal of those options.\nThe proposed provincial approval process for future and current bike lanes would add unnecessary red tape and bureaucracy to a municipal matter that shouldn't have provincial resources allocated to it. It would also slow down local governments trying to implement alternative travel options.\n"

        "comment": "These bike lanes have made it safe and comfortable for me to commute to work by bike - which is actually faster (and sadly, more reliable) than taking the ttc! I also uses the lanes on Bloor almost daily for shopping and to get to my fitness classes. It is most useful to have these lanes on primary, commercial streets where I can access the services I need. I also drive a car on Bloor from time to time and would like to report that the removal of the second lane has reduced the amount of aggressive driving and lane changing which makes for both a safer and more pleasant experience behind the wheel. Honestly, it doesn't feel like the drive takes much longer if at all. Let's not waste tax payer money with regressive steps like removing lanes and moving to secondary streets. We should be looking at solutions that make people want to leave their cars behind!\n"

        "comment": "There are several major items that challenging with this proposed legislation that I disagree with and strongly recommend the Government take the time to consider in its drafting.\n1. This proposal will increase congestion. Per the Bill's name \"Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time\" the proposal to remove existing infrastructure will fail to accomplish this, both for the numerous commuters who use the bike infrastructure AND the vehicle drivers who will be forced to wait through unnecessary construction for the removal. If this was a framework to consider where new bike lanes are placed that may work, but the premise that this will remove is like filling in a subway because the neighbours don't like the colour of the station. If the Province is committed to reducing congestion it should be focusing less on streets in the City of Toronto and more on wider transportation and economic linkages in the surrounding 905 that fuel a congested commute. The Gardiner and major arterials that are the source of congestion; the airport economic zone where traffic routinely standstill. If the Province is committed to building an urban area that is world class why is it trying to fix 'congestion' on Bloor where there has been little discernable impact to commute times pre/post bike lanes.\n2. Use of resources. It is a significant waste of tax-payer dollars in removing existing, well-used, safety improving transportation infrastructure while it is trying to advance a transportation infrastructure plan writ large. If the Province believes subways will be more successful with more unrestricted drivers on the road it need only look at the increase in stunt driving, reckless driving on the Gardiner and highways, increased traffic-caused fatalities, and driving vandalism to municipal speed cameras as evidence. Creating linkages for people who do not drive to access transit improves transit.\n3. Safety. Removal (even proposed) demonstrates that this Government does not value or care for the safety of the average citizen. Bike lanes have been shown beyond all doubt to improve the safety of residents/commuters who use them. This is especially true for children - the lane is safe for their use as well as a buffer from moving traffic. Replacing the lanes with parking even does not improve safety. Following through with removal is a clear sign that the Ministries of Transportation and Infrastructure, as well as the PMO, have lost the plot on their mandates and need to protect citizens.\n4. Livability and affordability. Bike lanes provide a cost-effective, safe means of travel for individuals who cannot afford a car. In a time where the Province has not made housing available, has not created new transportation linkages, and is instead focusing on taking away a commuting/economic connectivity option it is a narrow and short-sighted plan.\nThis framework demonstrates a short-sightedness that requires it be rethought and reexamined. If there is no clear cost estimate, safety consideration, or consideration for its immediate construction impacts it fails all tests for good legislation. The majority of people impacted by this are not car-commuters along bike paths. The majority are users of this infrastructure who are being left-behind by an outdated, car-centric, Government who with the same breath is preaching affordability/transit/livability. Real facts and evidence is not \"hogwash\". Without it this is a bad business deal for the whole Province.\n"

        "comment": "I am deeply concerned by this bill being put forward by Premier Ford and the Ontario PC Government. I live in London, Ontario, where multiple cyclists die every year as a result of collisions with vehicles. These deaths most often happen on our main thoroughfares, such as Hamilton Rd, which cyclists and cars alike must use in order to move efficiently around our city. Hamilton Rd, of course, does not have bike lanes, and every year we increase the number of deaths that take place as a direct result of that lack of infrastructure.\nI'd encourage the government and Premier Ford to consider not just the very real human cost of his proposal to remove bike lanes, but also the resounding consensus in the research. I'll quote Toronto's Dave Shellnut here:\n\"EMS vehicles are not delayed by bike lanes in getting folks to emergency rooms as confirmed by the City of Toronto\u2019s EMS leads.\nThere is not a petition of 50,000 people against the bike lanes on Bloor. It\u2019s more like 13,000 who\u2019ve signed over several years now and Cycle Toronto\u2019s petition in support of bike lanes is approaching that number in just weeks.\nBike lanes are good for business! They boost sales in areas they are installed, attract higher spending clientele, can increase property values, and even attract talented work forces.\nBike lanes do not increase congestion, they move people around more efficiently, create safer driving routes (less collisions, less congestion), and get people out of single occupancy motor vehicle, which actually are the cause of congestion.\nSide streets are not the answer. Unconnected segments of bike lanes that force cyclists to take circuitous routes on various side streets will not encourage people to get out of their cars and onto bikes.\"\nFundamentally, this Bill's foundation is misinformation. In addition to the above points, I would encourage the government to research the concept of \"induced demand\", a well-researched phenomena which tells us that increasing car lanes does not result in long-term improvements in traffic conditions. In fact, adding car lanes encourages more people to drive which actually worsens traffic exponentially.\nIf the goal of this Bill is, as it claims, to \"get people and goods out of gridlock and save drivers and businesses time and money\", then it would be better off proposing the rapid addition of protected bike lanes to create a bike network in every large city in Ontario. The best way to reduce gridlock is to reduce single-occupancy vehicles, and that is accomplished when people can safely choose alternative travel options, such as public transit and active transportation such as bike lanes.\n"

Without those lanes, there is no safe route to get to work. I stop frequently in the shops, grocery stores, and restaurants along my commute home.\nGet rid of the on-street parking instead of the bike lanes. The on-street parking only has spaces for a few hundred cars anyways. It's not efficient for people to park their private property on major streets. Additionally, the on-street parking requires traffic to stop every time a car is trying to parallel park. This impedes the flow of traffic much more significantly than the bike lanes.\n"
