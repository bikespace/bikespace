Like maybe develop the robotics industry or bio engineering or something...\nJust dont do this, I doubt it's gonna bring you that much benefits, and people gonna hate on you and your family. Are you really gonna be happy doing this? Would you be proud sitting in your rocking chair in your 80s thinking about all the bike lanes you've demolished?\nThink about it man, think\n"

Congestion will only increase and the city will get louder and less pleasant to exist in. Not a single urban designer would say that this is a good idea.\n"

Hamstringing a growing cycling infrastructure is one way to ensure people only drive, adding to congestion. Also why is the premier so insistent on becoming the super mayor of Toronto? Focus on the entire province and not just the city where you reside. Stop wasting tax dollars to take out infrastructure already in place!\n"

        "comment": "This bill disregards the countless studies that demonstrate the importance of pedestrian and bicyclist infrastructure. I was only able to attend school in Toronto because of direct and easy-to access bikes, particularly on Bloor St.\nEasy to build, low maintenance bike lanes remove conjestion for cars, public transportation, and parking lots. But only if there aren't barriers preventing cities from creating them.\nCar infrastructure has a long history of muddying public places and endangering the public. We do not need more barriers in the way of improving and developing Toronto (or the rest of Ontario) into a livable, equitable place.\n"

        "comment": "I urge an amendment to exempt bike lanes on low-volume streets and prioritize direct routes for cyclists. Removing bike lanes adds cars to the road, limiting transportation options and increasing congestion for everyone. Circuitous routes force cyclists into longer, less safe journeys, creating a double standard that treats them as second-class citizens and deepens transportation inequity. Allowing exemptions on low-volume streets would support a safe, sustainable, and inclusive system for all road users.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is absurd, bike lanes make it so that i don't need to own a car to live and can save a lot of money, without risking my neck. Cars on average cost over $16,000/year in canada according to a 2024 study. That amount of extra expense every year is simply impossible to fit into most budgets.\nCycling also saves additional money by being built-in exercise, so you don't need to get a gym membership, and spend less on healthcare.\nAdditionally, cycling infrastructure allows teenagers to safely travel around on their own without needing to be chaperoned by their parents. Autonomy is one of the most important things that a teenager can learn.\nThis bill is discriminatory against lower income and younger individuals, and is working to make cities a place that only the wealthy elites like Doug Ford can live. Why does this government want to make life less affordable and more dangerous for every day Ontarians?\n"

        "comment": "Doug Ford, the person that proposed this act, has square root of -1 intelligence and are just doing this for political gains. Bike lanes SAVE LIVES. Doug Ford is willing to sacrifice HUMAN LIVES to advance his political games. Bike lanes also reduces travel time for BOTH bikes and cars, since the only way to reduce traffic is to propose alternatives to driving. Adding an extra lane does not work at all - induced demand means that in a short period of time the road will be just as congested as before. Please stop playing political games and actually enact a policy that helps your citizens!!! The fact that this act was even proposed is an utter embarassment to Toronto, Ontario, and Canada as a whole. Want us to pay carbon tax? How about keep bike lanes to reduce emissions? The whole government is a true circus.\n"

        "comment": "As a driver, I don't want bikes in my lane\u2014it is less safe for me and for them. Bikes slow me down, increasing congestion for cars behind me. Having them moved to separate bike lanes speeds up my commute by getting bikes out of my way. Further, by having more people use bikes, they are less likely to drive, further reducing congestion on the street.\nIncreasing the number of lanes for cars will not decrease congestion for long -- research has long proven that.  Increasing bike lanes will increase the usage of bikes and therefore reduce the number of cars on the road.  I've attached studies on these points.\nMy drive into downtown Toronto would be made far better by keeping these bike lanes and expanding the network, so more people use them and drive less.  The changes proposed by this bill are a waste of money, and time.  The province should be focused on provincial matters, not municipal issues.\n"

        "comment": "Toronto has recently added bike lanes to the section of Eglinton Avenue near my home.\nI am a 74 year old, with arthritis in my knees and very much depend on my car to get me around the city and my neighbourhood.\nat first the bikes lanes irritated me--I found Eglinton to be more congested and the traffic slower.\nhowever after a few weeks i realized that i actually benefit from the bike lanes even though i personally cannot ride a bike. they caused the traffic to slow down in the areas where i shop and made crossing the street much easier. also i felt the street has become much more part of the community that is on the streets north and south of the shopping area and not so much just a speedway for other destinations.\nI see more people with their kids and dogs out on Eglinton. I suspect the local shops are also benefiting from this change of added bike lanes.\nI think it is a mistake and unwarranted for the province to change the decision of the city to add bike lanes. If people in any neighbourhood are unhappy, they can vote out their city councillors and the Mayor.\nI urge the province to drop this legislation. Please leave it up to city voters to decide on bike lanes in their areas through the municipal democratic process and not through provincial legislation.\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nThe growth of biking infrastructure has been wonderful for my family's ability to get around the city. I've been able to get to work faster and more consistently by biking. I know my viewpoint is anecdotal, but peer-reviewed data generally shows that increasing bike lane infrastructure is good for a city. Besides that, I think it's a waste of my taxes to tear out infrastructure that is already built. At the least, leave those in place. Thank you.\n"

Make the city more car friendly will only help traffic temporarily. It will only encourage more people to drive and we will eventually end up with the same gridlock we have now, but without bicyclists being able to get around the city in a safe and efficient way.\n"

        "comment": "(1) Removing bike lanes means cyclists will take up a full lane of traffic rather than half a lane, this will slow down cars and the number of accidents will go up.\n(2) The millions of trips that were taken by bike would either have to be done on transit, by walking or most likely by taking a car which would increase traffic.\n(3) ripping up lanes that have already been built is a waste of money\n(4) bike lanes usually look empty because many more people can travel in a smaller space. Bike traffic flow is a lot better than car traffic at moving people.\nThere are a lot more reasons i won't, just please bring in an expert or go to Montreal or Amsterdam and see what traffic can look like if we make it easier to travel without a car. (the more people choose to travel without a car the more space on the road is available for cars which makes traffic better)\n"

What about the many Torontonian\u2019s who don\u2019t have cars and rely on these bike lanes to safely get to work, shop, exercise or enjoy city attractions? And the studies that show opening up more car lanes does not reduce traffic? And the many new condos being built that won\u2019t even have parking within them, so people can\u2019t rely on their own cars to commute anywhere? Biking is much faster, more reliable and enjoyable than commuting by TTC in many cases. So backwards to be removing bikes. It\u2019s very upsetting for many.\n"
