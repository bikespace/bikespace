        "comment": "November 19, 2024\nHon. Prabmeet Sarkaria\nMinister of Transportation\n5th Floor \u2013 777 Bay Street\nToronto, ON M7A 1Z8\nDear Minister Sarkaria,\nRE: ERO 019-9266 \u2013 Bill 212, Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024 \u2013 Framework for bike lanes that require removal of a traffic lane\nOn behalf of V\u00e9lo Canada Bikes, we are writing to express our strong opposition to the proposed Bill 212, \u201cReducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024\u201d which would require provincial approval for new bike lanes on municipal roads involving the removal of a traffic lane, and would allow for the removal of existing bike lanes where a traffic lane has been taken away.\nAs the national voice for everyday cycling, V\u00e9lo Canada Bikes has been working for 12 years to promote evidence-based approaches to urban planning. We played a leading role in advocating for the establishment of Canada\u2019s National Active Transportation Strategy and Active Transportation Fund in order to support the creation of the very type of safe infrastructure which this bill threatens.\nThis bill represents a serious setback to the progress that has been made in Ontario toward improving road safety, public health, and sustainability. It is based on gross misconceptions about the causes of road congestion, undermines municipal autonomy, and will worsen the safety of vulnerable road users, including cyclists, pedestrians and wheelchair users.\nRemoving Bike Lanes Will Not Solve Road Congestion\nThe assumption that removing bike lanes, to allow for more car lanes, will lead to decreased road congestion is fundamentally flawed and entirely without evidence. Traffic congestion in municipalities in Ontario is driven primarily by over-reliance on single-occupancy vehicles, decades of under-investment in public transportation and active transportation infrastructure, and a lack of policies to reduce car use. When more car lanes are available, congestion actually gets worse due to the well-established phenomenon of induced demand. The removal of bike lanes will not address these core issues but will instead reinforce a car-dependent culture that exacerbates congestion.\nBy prioritizing cars over other forms of transportation, Bill 212 fails to recognize the positive role that bike lanes play in reducing the number of vehicles on the road. Dedicated cycling lanes provide a safe and efficient means for moving people around cities. A two-way protected bike lane can move 7,500 people/hour compared to only 600 to 1600 people/hour for a single car lane. Encouraging cycling reduces the overall number of cars on the road, helps ease congestion, contributes to cleaner air, improves population health, reduces greenhouse gas emissions, and enhances quality of life.\nRather than restricting or removing bike lanes, Ontario should be focused on supporting the construction of multi-modal transportation networks that include cycling, public transit, and walking infrastructure, as these are proven ways to reduce road congestion and improve the overall efficiency of the Province\u2019s transportation system, including for drivers.\nIncreased Risk to Vulnerable Road Users\nA very concerning consequence of this proposed bill is that it will increase the risk of serious injury or death for vulnerable road users, particularly cyclists, pedestrians, and wheelchair users. Removing bike lanes forces cyclists to share lanes with cars, making them more vulnerable to collisions.\nMultiple studies have shown that dedicated bike lanes are a critical element in reducing cyclist fatalities and injuries. Removing them would result in fewer safe spaces for cyclists, thereby increasing their risk of injuries and death. Without safe infrastructure for cycling, we risk a greater number of preventable deaths and injuries on Ontario\u2019s roads, which will place a substantial and unnecessary burden on Ontario\u2019s health care system.\nJurisdictional Overreach and Municipal Autonomy\nAnother troubling aspect of this bill is the overreach of provincial authority into municipal decision-making. Municipalities are best placed to understand the specific needs of their communities and to make decisions about transportation infrastructure accordingly. Duly elected local governments, in consultation with their residents, are working hard to create safer, healthier, and more sustainable transportation networks and communities.\nThis bill would strip municipalities of their ability to make decisions that reflect the priorities and needs of their residents. Cities like Toronto, Ottawa, and Hamilton have made significant progress in improving active transportation infrastructure, but this bill would slow down that progress and potentially reverse the positive steps already taken. Municipalities should have the autonomy to decide what is best for their communities, not have these decisions dictated by the province.\nLack of Evidence and Best Practices\nFinally, Bill 212 is not based on evidence or best practices for addressing congestion or improving road safety. Cities across the world, from Copenhagen to New York, have successfully integrated bike lanes into their road networks, demonstrating that cycling infrastructure can reduce traffic congestion, improve safety and quality of life, and serve as an economic driver. Businesses in Ontario who would be impacted by this ill-advised Bill have already voiced their strong opposition to the removal of bike lanes given the strong economic benefit that bike lanes provide.\nThe proposed bill to remove bike lanes is out of step with global best practices to prioritize active transportation and public transit. Instead of encouraging sustainable mobility, this bill reflects an outdated, car-centric approach to urban planning, which has been proven to be ineffective in addressing congestion, expensive, and harmful to public health.\nIn conclusion, the proposed bill will not solve congestion. Instead, it risks making Ontario's roads more dangerous for vulnerable road users, undermines municipal autonomy, disregards evidence-based best practices, and wastes money. Rather than removing bike lanes, we should be expanding and improving cycling infrastructure to make our streets safer and more sustainable for everyone.\nWe urge you to reconsider this bill and support evidence-based policies that promote safer, healthier, and more sustainable transportation options. Municipalities should be empowered to make decisions that meet the needs of their residents, and bike lanes should be recognized as an important tool in reducing congestion, improving road safety, and promoting active transportation.\nThank you for your time and consideration of our concerns.\nSincerely,\nKate Walker\nChair of the Board\nV\u00e9lo Canada Bikes\nSamuel Benoit\nExecutive Director\nV\u00e9lo Canada Bikes\n"

        "comment": "The city of Toronto should focus on removing vehicular traffic from the downtown core rather than increasing the amount of vehicles that exist in the downtown core. Countless examples are present of cities all over the world we are circulation throughout heavily populated areas is increased by focusing on pedestrian and bicycle traffic and removing vehicular traffic from cars.\nIf the city of Toronto is truly interested in increasing people's ability to move through the city efficiently and safely, they should be removing vehicular access to the downtown core and bolstering bicycle, public transit, and pedestrian access to these areas. The recent Taylor Swift concert is a perfect example, where the City closed roads and removed vehicular access from areas of downtown in order to support the circulation of pedestrians throughout the city. Not only did this create a safer space for pedestrians as they moved through the city, but other areas of the city became more efficient as well as people stopped driving downtown. I cannot say it more plainly: If you want to remove traffic, remove the things making the traffic. Do not allow for more of the things making the traffic into the place with the traffic.\nVehicular lanes can only become so narrow when car manufacturers are increasing the size of vehicles, and with the growing popularity of inefficient, oversized, and inappropriate use a vehicles to transport single individuals throughout the city, increasing the number of lanes for traffic will only incentivize people to create more and more gridlock.\nThe reason everyone loves to vacation in Europe is because the cities are walkable and visitors are able to get around efficiently and independently without the use of a motor vehicle. Creating a walkable city is 100% possible within Canadian cities, and the first step is incentivizing people to use public transit and bicycles by creating and supporting the infrastructure which allows it.\nRemoval of bike Lanes in the city of Toronto is a step towards grayer cities, and a historically proven way to decrease the livability, overall happiness, and efficiency of a city.\nFinally, if bike lanes are removed from the city, historically, cyclists will make their own lanes creating more traffic, more accidents, more injuries, and a worse City\n"

        "comment": "I oppose Bill 212 on three grounds\n- Overreach; we trust our city and town governments to handle local roads and infrastructure.\n- Waste of the people's money; our tax money was spent building infrastructure and I don't like the province committing to spend again to change it\n- Unsupportable claims; the rationale for the bill is to reduce gridlock and save time yet there is not a shred of evidence that replacing bike lanes with car lanes (or preventing cities from installing bike lanes that reduce car lanes) will do either. After an initial flush, the induced demand will create longer commutes.\nI encourage the province to instead support cities building safe, comprehensive cycling infrastructure. Research shows that dedicated cycling lanes can significantly reduce the number of cars on the road by offering a viable, safe, and efficient alternative for in-city trips. Cycling encourages more people to shop locally by making it easier to access retail areas in a sustainable manner. And studies on cycling and health found that cities with well-established cycling networks report lower rates of obesity, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory illnesses.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes save lives! We cannot remove them. One of the bike lanes that is proposed to be removed (Bloor/Danforth) is one I use every single day twice a day. I used to ride along Danforth when there was no bike lane, and the new protected bike lanes have provided an exponential difference to my feeling of safety and security. No cyclist should feel like they are putting their life in their hands to commute to work. This is an essential corridor across the city that hosts thousands of cyclists a day.\nCondos in the downtown core are being built with very minimal car parking, and many bike parking spots instead, to promote sustainability and reduce the amount of cars in the city. Creating hundreds of new homes for people and promoting cycling as a mode of transportation for them is in direct opposition to Bill 212. How can we promote greener city living without protecting those same lives? It doesn't make any sense.\nMany other urban cities in Europe have put actions in place to reduce the number of cars in the city, to allow for smoother commuting in the city. We cannot risk the safety of our own Toronto citizens for the ease of commuters, especially for those from outside the city.\nNot to mention the colossal waste of taxpayer money it would be to build bike infrastructure (some of which was just completed just 2 months ago) and then tear it all up again. A complete unnecessary waste. Take the money that would be used to remove the bike lanes and instead put it toward better TTC and GO train service to take cars off the road.\n"

        "comment": "I am appalled that the Government of Ontario has chosen this path of ignoring responsibility to providing more safe multi-modal transportation options to people who cannot afford to drive regularly, or who want to move minimize their environmental impact, or who just want a healthy and fun way to stay active.\nI'm appalled because bicycling as an option for travel has been on a positive trend for the last 19 years or so since municipalities have decided to make it a priority to build more bike lanes across cities in Ontario. The data that the government has used to justify this action is backward looking and ignores the trend that cycling has been progressively more popular, and moreover it ignores the fact that to get more people cycling and out of cars they need to continue to build more cycling infrastructure.\nI'm particularly concerned as I think about the futures of the cities we want to have in Ontario going forward . We want it to be easier to build cycling infrastructure for cities not harder, because as populations in cities continue to grow with more immigration, we need less people in cars. More and better biking lanes will be a key part of helping us do this.\nWe also need to make sure Ontario does its part to help Canada and the world meet its net zero environmental goals by 2050. Putting Bill 212 in place will do enormous harm by giving people fewer options in the future to choose environmentally friendly transportation, and will only make reducing our dependence on fossil fuels more difficult, which we need to do now if we have any chance of salvaging a liveable world for future generations.\n"

        "comment": "I strongly oppose Bill 212, which threatens sustainable urban development and prioritizes car dependency over community well-being. Removing protected bike lanes on streets like Yonge, Bloor, and University Avenue is a step backward, undermining public safety, environmental sustainability, and equitable transportation access.\nProtected bike lanes promote safe, efficient alternatives to car travel, reducing congestion and emissions. Numerous studies highlight their benefits for both traffic flow and local economies. Limiting municipalities\u2019 authority to develop such infrastructure stifles innovation and disregards the needs of urban residents.\nAdditionally, the bill\u2019s exemptions for Highway 413 from environmental assessment processes and its curtailment of property rights in expropriation cases set a dangerous precedent. These measures favor unchecked highway expansion at the expense of environmental stewardship and citizen protections.\nOntario must invest in a multimodal future where cycling, public transit, and pedestrian infrastructure are treated as essential components of urban planning. Please reject Bill 212 to ensure a healthier, more inclusive, and forward-thinking province.\n"

        "comment": "I am a pedestrian myself....not a driver or a cyclist who fully supports the removal of bike lanes but not just on Bloor, Yonge and University but on Cummer Avenue and both Eglinton Avenue East and Eglinton Avenue West.  I have previously written with specific concerns about those bike lanes specifically.   Not only should all bike lanes where lanes of traffic have been removed be removed, but for those to remain there has to be serious discussions and conversations being held by both the Provincial Government and at the Municipal level.  That there has to be a look at all causes of the congestion as well from bike lanes to an uptick in delivery drivers as well.\nI think there has to be an honest look at the whole practice and what claims are being made by the Cyclists themselves.  I know serious Cyclists who ride in all sorts of weather who refuse to even ride in the bike lanes as they believe that they are dangerous due to also the other cyclists who are not as experienced riding in them.  They also themselves criticize the way and how they have been implemented and where they have been placed by the City and Metrolinx.\nI believe that there needs to be a look at the statistics of fatalities and injuries to Cyclists and Pedestrians prior to the bike lanes and after the bike lanes have been installed, and I can guarantee you that due to the bike lanes that there is a major uptick and increase in accidents leading to Hospitalizations or deaths.  Bike lanes have led to increase of congestion on our roads which has directly impacted our Emergency services (Police, Ambulances and Fire Trucks) reaching an emergency or the Hospitals in a timely manner.  Regular Citizens of Toronto have watched out of their windows or walking along the streets as these vehicles are stuck and completely stopped in traffic with no where for them to go and no where for the cars themselves to move over to as there is a bike lane there blocking them from having any where for them to move to to get out of the way.  Meaning people losing their lives due to them being held up, and leading to lawsuits.\nTTC buses and those taking this form of transit are now stuck on these buses for a commute that is double or triple the time it used to take on all roads with one lane of traffic in each direction with TTC bus routes having to coincide with bike lanes.  I am sure that there has been studies done and the City's solution to it is to just add RED LANES to these roads instead of acknowledging that the bike lanes are an issue.  There are also those living along both Cummer Avenue and Yonge Street (by Summerhill) that find it completely impossible to get out of their driveways or off of their streets now due to these bike lanes.  We also have no traffic allowed into a major tourist attraction and park such as High Park cutting off a segment of the population such as our most Vunerable our Elderly Senior Citizens and the Disabled.\nBut even if you keep some bike lanes then those riding within them on illegal devices such as e-scooters, e-bikes and regular bikes, mopeds etc. should be LICENSED and INSURED and have to pass a TEST on rules of the road and proper cycling rules.  There should have to learn to use hand signals, wear helmets, have lights on their bikes, have a whistle and bell on their bike and get off of their bike to walk it across an intersection or at a stop sign.  MOST IMPORTANTLY they should have to repsect RED LIGHTS and TRAFFIC SIGNS such as STOP SIGNS and stop blowing through them.  As a pedestrian I am at risk of being hit not only by cars now but by them as well as they do not stop and I have myself have had a few near misses as the cars are all stopped for the red light but the Cyclists blow through it or whip around a corner into or in front of the pedestrians crossing.  They should have to ride on the road and stay there instead of jumping from the bike lane to the sidewalk or the road onto the sidewalk and back down again.  They are a NUISANCE and a MENANCE and more dangerous to us Pedestrians than cars are now as when walking on the sidewalks you need to have eyes in the back of your head to watch for those vehicles which are motorized and riding on the sidewalks flying up behind you or to the side of you and you do not hear or see them.  DO THIS PLEASE BEFORE SOMEONE IS KILLED.  They should be insured and have to pay the medical bills of those who they hit on the sidewalks.  And they never ever ride in the BIKE LANES.  The only bike lanes being utilized themselves are BLOOR STREET WEST but no where else do you see any cyclists on them.  Were they only built to ACCOMMODATE the UBEREATS and SKIP THE DISHES Gangs?  Totally irresponsible and ignorant of both the City and the Province to have done this at all and to have given big contracts to any of those companies.  I was told by Councillor Saxe as I was almost run down by an e-bike food delivery driver that it is the Province that can be blames that they are not licensed or insured because the Provincial Government will not allow it.  WHY WOULD YOU NOT?\nExamining the CONGESTION ON THE ROADS has to INCLUDE the UPTICK IN DELIVERY VEHICLES AND FOOD DELIVERY COMPANIES and CONSTRUCTION COMPANIES BUILDING CONDOS taking up lanes of traffic. And the Province is also at FAULT AND RESPONSIBLE for them as well as the City and both are responsible for our 24/7 deliveries which should not be allowed especially for those of us living in buildings without 10-storey podiums.  The increase of DELIVERY and CONSTRUCTION Vehicles on our roads can be attributed directly to the PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT ITSELF and you and the City have to fix it by implementing a CAP on all of them.  They are a direct result as well to the CONGESTION on our Roads.  If you can not recognize that yourselves then nothing will ever be resolved regardless if you remove bike lanes.\nAll of this by the City and the Province have led to some dangerous driving and cycling as well being pushed and forced onto our Residential side streets as cars rush to get around congestion on our main roads by rushing their turns and speeding down our residential side streets as well.  Blowing through their turn and making it blind putting those of us pedestrians in harm's way as we walk responsibly ourselves in the pedestrian crosswalk.  There is also an uptick in illegal parking in front of our homes to the point where EMERGENCY vehicles can no longer reach our homes either and we can not reach our homes as this is also a direct result of all of it as well.\nPLEASE DO SOMETHING TO RESOLVE IT ALL!\n"

The removal of currently installed bike lanes will NOT improve what is at the heart of gridlock and will only serve to make the roads more dangerous for cyclists who are, in fact, helping to reduce air pollution AND traffic. Bike lanes have greater passenger capacity than car lanes; bike lanes need to be in place and functional (i.e. ideally separated; being clear and not having items, snow, or cars blocking them) for a greater number of riders to use them. Overwhelming evidence has shown that bike lanes decongest and decarbonize. If the Ford government actually wants to be responsive to evidence, it needs to stop making policy and law based on vested interests, misinformation, and emotive reasoning aimed at a conservative base.\n"

        "comment": "I have previously commented on my opposition to Bill 212, but that was before the update of October 31, 2024 where the framework would require the province to remove sections of the Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue bike lanes in the City of Toronto and return them to a lane of traffic for motor vehicles.\nI feel that this specific provision in Bill 212 is particularly terrible because it flies in the face of the government\u2019s own proposed review process where municipalities are required to submit information about existing bike lanes on municipal roads where an existing vehicle lane was removed. In the very notice for Bill 212, it says \u201cbased on the outcome of the review, a regulation could be made to require the removal of the bike lane and its return to a lane of traffic.\u201d\nTo this statement, I ask the question: what review did the provincial government conduct that determined sections of bike lanes on Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue should be removed? It appears that no reviews were conducted, no rationale other than a severely misinformed view that bike lanes cause congestion has been provided, and certainly no \u201cevidence-based\u201d decision making has been employed here.\nInstead, we have Premier Ford saying that the City of Toronto\u2019s $48 million estimate for the cost of removing bike lanes on these three streets is \u201chogwash.\u201d\nhttps://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/report-cost-removal-bike-lanes-t\u2026\nNo, hogwash is throwing millions of dollars already spent and approved by the City in the bin. Hogwash is saying there will be \u201ca set of specified criteria\u201d according to which municipalities need to follow for new or existing bike lanes to be approved by the Province, and then predetermining the outcome for bikes lanes on Bloor, Yonge, and University before such criteria has even been developed. Hogwash is the temerity of the Premier and the Transportation Minister to override the will of municipalities \u2013 Toronto in particular \u2013 whose elected officials approved the implementation of bike lanes only after EXTENSIVE REVIEW conducted by experienced City officials who are much better placed than the Province to make these determinations.\nI am enraged that the Province of Ontario is actively working to rip up existing cycling infrastructure paid for through my property taxes. As a cyclist, I have come to depend on safe infrastructure that prevents motor vehicles from maiming or killing me in my daily commute. All Toronto cyclists have come to depend on this infrastructure, but not all will simply give up cycling if the Government has its way and tears up the bike lanes on Bloor, Yonge, and University. These streets will continue to be used by cyclists, only they will now be put in danger. Know this: by removing these bike lanes and preventing the expansion of cycling networks in municipalities across Ontario, the Premier and the Minister of Transportation will be partly responsible for the deaths and injuries of not only cyclists but motorists and pedestrians who are safer precisely because cycling infrastructure forces motorists to slow down and obey speed limits.\nI will not repeat all my previous arguments, but I will say that just about every organization I have seen with thoughts on Bill 212 have been opposed to this legislation. To mention just a few, we have the Ontario Professional Planners Institute who say \u201cthe proposed legislative changes will not reduce congestion, will increase risk to public safety, and move away from evidence-based practices. It is also counter to the 2024 Provincial Planning Statement, which includes several policies that support the use of bike lanes.\u201d\nhttps://ontarioplanners.ca/OPPIAssets/Documents/Policy-Papers/OPPI-Stat\u2026\nThe Association of Municipalities of Ontario has said \u201cBicycle lanes are an essential element of urban transportation planning and road safety. Requiring provincial approval would be a significant overreach into municipal jurisdiction.\u201d\nhttps://www.amo.on.ca/policy/finance-infrastructure-and-economy/provinc\u2026\nThe Ontario Society of Professional Engineers, in their response to Bill 212, say that the bill \u201cis a step in the wrong direction for Ontario\u2019s future\u201d and that \u201cthis proposed legislation risks reinforcing a car-centric approach to urban planning that prioritizes vehicles over pedestrians and cyclists. Limiting bike lane installation and removing environmental assessment processes for major highway projects does nothing to reduce gridlock. In fact, it actively ignores the growing demand for more sustainable, safe, and diverse transportation options.\u201d\nhttps://ospe.on.ca/advocacy/response-to-bill-212-why-we-need-to-rethink\u2026\nOn the day that I write this comment, I see that the University of Toronto has written to Mayor Chow and the Toronto City Council to \u201creiterate the University of Toronto\u2019s support for bike lanes that increase access to the U of T campus and surrounding community. In 2017, U of T supported the Bloor Bike Lanes Pilot Project and continues to see the value of bike lanes in enhancing modes of safely accessing the University Campus.\u201d\nhttps://x.com/DianneSaxe/status/1859286160540839947/photo/1\nSimilarly, the Bloor-Annex Business Improvement Area (BIA) has been quoted in an article saying \u2018\u201cIf Premier Ford is looking for evidence showing the positive impact of bike lanes, he should look no further than the Bloor Annex Business Improvement Area (Bloor Annex BIA),\u201d the BIA said, adding that removing any bike lanes in the area would be \u201cdisastrous to the neighbourhood.\u201d\u2019\nhttps://toronto.citynews.ca/2024/10/31/ontario-confirms-it-aims-to-remo\u2026\nOne last question I have for the Province of Ontario is whether there is any limit to the number of individuals protesting and organizations publishing statements in opposition to Bill 212 that would force the Government to reconsider this incredibly wrong-headed piece of legislation?\nI know from the Greenbelt Scandal that Premier Ford is capable of abandoning ill-advised plans and I hope the same is true this time around. This is because, as I have previously stated, people will get seriously injured and die because of this legislation. There is absolutely no good that will come from passing Bill 212 into law and I urge Premier Ford and Transportation Minister Sarkaria to reverse course for the good of all Ontario road users.\n"
