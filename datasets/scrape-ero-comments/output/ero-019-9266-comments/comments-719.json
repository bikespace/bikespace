        "comment": "As on Ontario and Toronto resident who both drives and bikes, I find this Bill and rationale for it poor at best, and more focussed on driving a political agenda vs. fixing the problem of gridlock. There are root causes of gridlock you can be focussing on vs. pitting cyclists against motorists. Cyclists need a safe place to ride to increase more citizens to ride to get around the city, which can also reduce the need to get in a car. Torontonians often wear both hats, if not them directly, then their family.\nMore importantly, this is a municpal matter that municipalities and their citizens can address vs having Queens Park dictating what happens. This over-reach is not necessary and is not productive.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes improve safety for cyclists and drivers . We should also be encouraging the use of public transit and environmentally friendly means of transportation such as cycling rather than continuing to push the agenda for cars and fossil fuels. The inconvenience of traffic in urban centers should encourage funding for alternative modes of transportation. This also goes for highways and road ways that destroy farmlands and forests . Focusing on efficient transit such ad trains and buses should be prioritized.\nBy prioritizing the \u00ab\u00a0rights\u00a0\u00bb of cars over cyclists you show that you do not care about the safety of your constituents or the environment\n"

I hope you will appreciate how few roads we are talking about, but how many lives are and can be saved keeping cars and bicycles separate. Risking lives to go to work, appreciate your support for keeping bike lanes that are already built. Many thanks, safe driving and riding.\n"

        "comment": "There are multiple pieces of this bill that are problematic:\nThe lack of oversight with regard to environmental impact and engineering oversight, and ignoring feedback from experts in these areas to push through the highway projects named in this bill.\nThe overreach of powers to dictate how municipalities can manage their own roads.\nRemoving bike lanes will not make traffic better, it will make cyclists less safe and cause more people to resort to commuting by car. Roads with bike lanes that are underused do not indicate that the bike lanes are not needed on those roads, but rather that a lack of an overall bike lane network prevents people who would prefer to commute by bike from doing so due to feeling unsafe sharing lanes with cars on stretches of their journey which lacks protected bike lanes.\nWe have an underused highway that could be diverting congestion from highway 401 but it seems like no serious thought has been put into using highways we already have to relieve congestion.\nThis bill also curiously includes policy for broadband internet, which seems unrelated to the rest of the bill, unless it is included to provide infrastucture to support efforts to privatize/toll these or future highway developments.\n"

I currently use the bike lanes that were put in with years of debate and cost of millions of dollars, partly for the safety of health care workers like myself who cycle to work at UHN.\nI support local decision making and wish for municipalities to decide on future bike lanes and complete streets where planners have found them to make sense. Thank you.\n"

        "comment": "If you consult research and the opinions of the most respected urban and city planners and experts in traffic safety, the value of bike lanes is quite clear. My personal opinion on the matter is based on the facts, research, data and my belief that those things should guide the decision-not anger or frustration or myths. Let the experts make the plans and do their jobs and what they are trained in-not politicians and citizens who are out for themselves. Would we consult a chef on how to roof a house? Would we consult an architect on how to provide childcare for infants? A painter to write a legal document? Of course not, so let's let people do their jobs and build a world class City.\nThe City has already spent millions installing the lanes and other related infrastructure, it would be a colossal waste of taxpayers money to rip them up, undo this work and replace them with a lanes of traffic (that is probably going to be blocked by parked cars and delivery and ride share vehicles anyway). I'd like to see this money spent on enforcing the traffic laws properly and more often. When I am driving around the City, the biggest frustration I have are people in cars, trucks, vans pulled over blocking lanes and flow of traffic, vehicles blocking intersections (\"the box\") and other selfish driving behavior.\nWe also need to enforce cyclists and riders of various electric bikes, scooters etc. to follow the rules e.g. use lights. I'd rather have them all in their own lane than have to have them in my lane when I am driving,\nCars want cyclists out of their way and out of their lanes...bikes want the cars out of their space....why are we proposing to make them share?! They both want the same thing!\n"

        "comment": "Overall I\u2019m very concerned with the short-sightedness of our Provincial Government on the issue of reducing gridlock and saving time.\nOne - removing the bike lanes will not save significant time for drivers and they are already there. Cars stopping/parking illegally, increased number of traffic lights and poor light timing/length of lights, and pedestrian crossing are bigger issues.\nThe bike lanes DO save bikers time and make it SAFER to navigate our busy roads; and they are being used. The longer they are in place the more they will be used. Plus, we need to find ways to reduce traffic - not make it easier to drive into the city - and this is a viable way to do that!\nYes - everyone cannot bike but everyone cannot drive either nor easily navigate the TTC - but we don\u2019t get rid of those options or make it unsafe for people to continue to have alternative travel options.\nI do drive and I\u2019m a biker. I live near Bloor where the lane was extended and traffic is not that bad. So I don\u2019t get it. I also can\u2019t believe you would spend or should I say waste our money on this issue.\nPlease - do not pass this bill. It\u2019s the wrong thing to do.\n"

        "comment": "The proposal for the removal of bike lanes is a gross misuse of funding, and by moving forward with this bill the City of Toronto is actively endangering thousands of both cyclists and drivers alike. There are other measures than can be taken to reduce gridlock that do not involve putting cyclists at risk, such as diverting funding in to expanding & improving upon our existing transit infrastructure.  Access to bike lanes and improved transit infrastructure will result in less people driving their cars daily, therefore reducing gridlock, rendering this bill not only unnecessary but counterproductive.\nBudget should be allocated to diversifying safe travel options for commuters, not removing infrastructure than has been created specifically to support creating a safe, efficient, environmentally friendly commute.\n"

        "comment": "Ontario should seek to emulate successful urban planning strategies in other cities to create livable, dynamic and environmentally resilient communities. Part of the strategy is to encourage local decision makings, including the construction of bike lanes. Instead of centralizing decision-making and double-guess municipalities, the province should respect the plannings and hearings local communities have put in.\nThere is a fantastic article on Bloomberg on how Arlington city in Virginia, next to Washington DC, has the lowest urban traffic mortality and crime rate by creating a walkable, transit and bike-friendly city. It is in Ontario's interest to heed evidence and scientific analysis, instead of being guided on impulses by a few rich friends of the governing party hated out in a bar in Etobicoke. You can't have a dynamic, economically successful, and environmentally resilient city when you treat the dense downtown mainly as a highway thoroughfare and a massive parking lot.\n"

        "comment": "Removal of bike lanes will not improve traffic. Removing bike lanes will cause more accidents between cyclist and drivers, which will create more traffic for drivers.\nSmaller bike lanes could help reduce traffic. Giving more space for cars to drive, while also giving a safe area for people who cycle.\nProviding more transit options such as bus routes, subway lines, and light rail can also help elevate traffic. By providing people with more ways to travel, this would free up more space on the road for people who need to drive.\n"
