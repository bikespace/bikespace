        "comment": "I am writing to STRONGLY OPPOSE this legislation, which is not evidence-based. This bill falsely attributes bike lanes as the cause of car traffic congestion, and not the main contributor in Toronto, which is construction.\nI have been an all-season, all-weather cyclist in Toronto for over a decade. Like many people living in the city, car ownership is not affordable or desirable to me. When I occasionally need to make a trip by carshare, I much prefer to drive on streets where cyclists are safely separated from mixing with traffic. I had to overcome a lot of fear to start riding in the city, at a time when Rob Ford was ripping out some of the few bike lanes we had.\nI ride carefully and defensively but I still have a lot of fear, because on streets where I have to mix with traffic, people drive dangerously, passing too closely and at high speeds. Some drivers seem oblivious and do not check on the right before changing lanes or making right turns, while some are deliberately threatening or aggressive. I have feared for my life because drivers who think cyclists do not belong on streets have tried to run me down or scare me. I frequently need to ride with my small dog in a backpack, and I am viscerally aware that any accident that I might survive would likely be fatal for her.\nThe data shows that traffic congestion is improved by getting people to take fewer trips by car, and more trips using public transit and active transportation. This bill ignores the basic facts of induced demand -- more car lanes will not reduce traffic, but they will make it more dangerous and deadly for vulnerable road users. This has already been the deadliest year for cyclists in about 2 decades.\nFewer car trips and more bike lanes make for healthier communities by decreasing noise pollution, improving air quality, and allowing people of all ages to safely exercise through active transportation like cycling and walking. Reduced emissions from fewer car trips help us meet our climate obligations. Bike lanes can provide a buffer between often narrow, crowded downtown sidewalks and high-speed car traffic, making it less stressful to be a pedestrian, especially when walking with children or dogs.\nThere is an economic incentive for businesses along main streets with bike lanes. The Bloor-Annex BIA recently released a statement saying monthly consumer spending has INCREASED since the installation of bike lanes, and removing them would be \"disastrous\" for area businesses. People are going to destinations on main streets, and relocating bike lanes to disjointed side streets will not serve the same purpose. Unlike main streets, side streets do not have bridges and infrastructure to cross natural barriers like rivers/ravines in the city.\nThis government has been sharing misleading data about the percentage of people who travel by car or bicycle. In the downtown core, a minority of people commute by car. A 2019 study showed that almost 70% of Torontonians are cyclists in some capacity. There is a high demand for BikeShare, with an estimated 6 million trips expected this year alone.\nWe need CONNECTED cycling networks in the city. The data shows here and around the world, that cycling trips vastly increase wherever bike lanes are installed. Deaths and injuries of vulnerable road users decrease greatly when there are fewer cars, and those cars drive at slower speeds.\nIf this government was serious about decreasing car traffic, they would reduce car dependency so that fewer people need to take trips by cars. Protected bike lane networks are one crucial way to reduce trips by car. It is absolutely nonsensical now and for our future needs as populations increase, to prevent cycling networks from being built and to remove current protected bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "**Opposition to Bill 212 and Highway 413 Act, 2024**\nHello,\nI\u2019m writing as a concerned citizen to oppose Bill 212 and the Highway 413 Act, 2024.\nHighway 413 won\u2019t solve congestion\u2014it will make it worse. Experts around the world have proven that building more highways leads to induced demand, creating more traffic and pollution. If we want to reduce gridlock, we need smart, forward-thinking solutions like better public transit and bike lanes. Every bike on the road is one less car, which means less pollution, less noise, and safer streets for everyone.\nRemoving bike lanes in Toronto under Bill 212 is a huge step backward. These lanes don\u2019t just help cyclists\u2014they make streets safer for pedestrians and drivers too. Plus, local businesses benefit from increased foot and bike traffic. Why would we take away something that helps people get around safely and supports our economy?\nPlease reconsider this bill. Ontario needs infrastructure that brings people together, not policies that divide us and harm our future. Let\u2019s invest in sustainable, community-centered transportation solutions that benefit everyone.\nThank you.\n"

        "comment": "The removal of the bike lanes on Bloor, Yonge and University would be a huge step backwards when it comes to biking in the city, removing the most essential parts of the bike network in this city. Not only that, but many of these lanes have only just been put in, and now they're all being taken back out? How will all that extra construction help the traffic? And who's paying to remove all the bike lanes after paying to put them in?\nIn the meantime where will the cyclists be forced to ride? On the streets, with the cars, completely unprotected now that the dedicated bike lanes are gone. This would be a terribly unsafe situation for both cyclists and motorists, a situation that we've only just been starting to resolve with the expansion of the bike lane network!\nI use my bike almost every day. I consider the bike lanes an essential piece of transit infrastructure. I use them as much as I use the sidewalks or the TTC. Removing the bike lanes would severely limit my transit options, and the options of the ever-growing community of other bike-users throughout Toronto and the rest of the province!\nAnd on that note: I see this bill as a tremendous overreach by the provincial government. Surely this should be a municipal issue! The province has no business muddying the affairs of city government with bureaucracy and red tape.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are vital transportation infrastructure and I strongly oppose this bill. My family owns a car, however, when it's being used, my mother and I often cycle for shopping and eating out, even during the winter months. This is made possible with the safe infrastructure that has been built over the past few years by the City of Toronto. Without it, my family would likely purchase a second vehicle, adding more congestion to the streets.\nA 2019 survey of Toronto residents found that 70% of people cycle for any purpose, and 44% cycle for utilitarian purposes such as work, school shopping, etc. Bike Share Toronto has reported 5.7 million trips in 2023 and is on track to reach 6 million trips this year. Removing bike lanes will put all these people in danger and road fatalities will increase. Congestion will also become worse as these people switch to driving.\nInstead of destroying valuable farmland for Highway 413 and removing transportation options, the PC government should invest more in public transit and put more effort into completing existing projects like the Eglinton LRT.\n"

        "comment": "Bike lanes are used almost entirely but local commuters.  Since a cyclist uses much less road space then an automobile it is clear that encouraging local commuters to committee by bike should actually lessen consideration for drivers on the roads.\nOne of the main disincentives for people to commute by bike is the perceived safety from automobile traffic.  Dedicated bike lanes should encourage more people who would consider commuting bike bike to do so helping decrease traffic congestion.  Side benefits include improved health of those using active transport and less impact on the environment.\n"

        "comment": "I am vehemently opposed to Bill 212 and strongly urge the provincial government to abandon this bill. Bicycle lanes save lives. Individuals of all ages and abilities should have access to safe and equitable cycling infrastructure so that they can arrive at their destinations alive. Safe cycling infrastructure ensures that children, families, seniors, and individuals with disabilities can safely partake in active transportation. People on bikes use bike lanes to access schools, workplaces, essential services, medical appointments, and businesses. Safe cycling infrastructure reduces gridlock by encouraging mode shift away from private vehicles to active transportation and facilitates \"last mile\" solutions between public transit and destinations. Bike lanes on Yonge Street, University Avenue, and Bloor Street in Toronto provide vital links for community members, visitors, and workers to travel safely between neighbourhoods, access businesses, and partake in civic life. I strongly urge the provincial government to maintain established bike lanes in Ontario and advocate for increased and enhanced cycling infrastructure to improve safety for all road users.\n"

        "comment": "It is difficult to accept that the world is changing and that designing our cities around driving is not working. At the same time, this feels very similar to the decision to bury the Eglinton LRT line that was made by the Mike Harris government. Decades later we are still waiting for this line to be completed. As someone who both drives and cycles, I have found that my car commute on Bloor St has actually improved with the cycling lanes and is slightly faster. When I cycle, I also am much safer as a result. Please reconsider this bill as it puts cyclists lives at risk, hampers our cities' abilities to deal with the root causes of gridlock and is disappointingly out of touch with the need to shift away from our car-centric planning.\n"

The provincial government should not be adding more red tape and oversight to this type of needed infrastructure. Bike lanes provide a safe and convenient alternative to driving and allow for greater ease of access to the rest of the city. I use these bike lanes frequently and do not want to see tax payer money spent on removing newly created bike lanes. By having bike lanes people are encouraged to bike over using their cars. This means less cars on the roads which intern would reduce congestion. The many positives of bike lanes have been documented in the bike lane pilot study on Bloor including economic growth to local business and increased ridership along the lanes. Please reconsider your plans for treating congestion because removing bike lanes would not solve it.\n"

        "comment": "I am making a comment for \"Bill 212 - Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024 - Framework for bike lanes that require removal of a traffic lane.\"\nThis past weekend, fellow Torontonians rallied in the hundreds with their bikes to demand that you PROTECT their lanes, not remove it.\nI live in Scarborough, where biking infrastructure is almost non-existant. I drive very often, and driving in Scarborough has gotten increasingly scary and dangerous despite new speed and red light cameras in the area. Crossing at the crosswalk during the pedestrian light has led to multiple close calls, as cars have hit me several times by running the red and failing to stop at red. This shows that drivers are unpredictable and dangerous, and that police enforcement of driving laws is almost non-existant. I can never imagine biking on such roads, even if there are bike lanes.\nDowntown Toronto is MADE for biking, it just makes sense. With the large dense areas and shops with storefronts along the highest traffic areas, and with subway stops everywhere bike lanes save lives and offers an additional form of transportation in someone's journey. Our own mayor bikes regularly. Delivery guys use the bikelanes for deliveries which our city and small businesses have come to rely on. In removing the BRAND NEW bike lanes on Bloor and other bike lanes in the heart of the city, you not only waste tax payer money but you also waste time - the time it took for the procedures and policies it took to get those bike lanes in the first place. Each of those bikers will become a driver - a single occupancy vehicle standing in traffic growing irritated with the lights and congestion. 6 bikers = space of 1 car. Do we want Toronto to be a car park? Or a moving city?\nStay in your lane Doug Ford. Leave bike lanes alone.\n"

        "comment": "Hello, I am a driver and a cyclist. I commute by both but more by bike. I am commenting on behalf of safe bike lanes. This is a horrible idea, to take away bike lanes for more car congestion. There are so many people that bike in large cities to get cars off of the roads, or to have less people parking downtown and for health and environmental impacts. There are so many people that cannot afford to drive or park their cars so they resort to biking. If there aren\u2019t bike lanes where will cyclists ride? In between the sidewalk and traffic with no space to bike? This will cause more accidents on the roadways for cyclists. Without a lane, cars do not see the cyclists and so many times I have almost been hit on my bike ride to work when I am on the road. I have to resort to the sidewalk when there isn\u2019t a lane just for my safety as cars will not give me enough room to ride my bike. The result of no bike lanes is congested sidewalks , where pedestrians will have more bikes on the sidewalk to be safe which isn\u2019t safe for pedestrians. There needs to be a place for cyclists especially on high traffic areas. Please reconsider every cyclists safety. Cyclists  are here due to the lack of infrastructure for cars and parking and the high cost of gas and our environment, do make it safe for us and make the right choice to safe lives.\n"
