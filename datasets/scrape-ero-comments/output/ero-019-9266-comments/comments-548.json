        "comment": "I've been struggling with Toronto. I've lived in many cities and towns across Canada in my lifetime, and lately I've been wondering why I came back here. It feels more and more unliveable. More expensive, more congested, more angry. Bike lanes have been a welcome antidote to these feelings. When new bike lanes recently were added to my neighbourhood, I immediately noticed how many people were out using them. Families and commuters suddenly had a new and less frustrating, healthy and joyous way to move through our neighbourhood. I joined them and it made me feel better about where I live. People fought long and hard for the bike lanes on Bloor. There were growing pains at first, but now that they have settled, they are doing a world of good.\nBike lanes are good for business: Following the bike lane installation on Bloor, there were more customers for Bloor businesses, and 90% of customers to Bloor arrive by foot, bicycle or transit (see The Centre for Active Transportation's 2017 Economic Impact Study of Bike Lanes)\nThey\u2019re good for the environment AND congestion: more people cycling means less cars on the road. Many cyclists are ALSO drivers. Many cyclists choose to drive when they don't feel safe on a bike in the absence of bike lanes. Bike lanes save lives.\nThey\u2019re good for public and personal health: building fitness into peoples daily lives through supporting cycling has long term effects on personal health, decreasing the burden on our public health care system over time.\nBike lanes, like public transit, are identifiers of world class cities. I don't want to live in a city without them.\n"

        "comment": "I do not support Bill 212 because it 1) is a waste of money 2) is not based on fact 3) as a driver I prefer them 4) when I do bike, I prefer them 5) seems like an overstep of the provincial government 6) is not a priority for the people of Ontario.\n1) the biking infrastructure is already in place, at a great expense to the taxpayer. Ripping them out is a step backwards and a huge waste of money. Money that could be better spent fixing the backlog in fixing our schools, addressing the huge short falls in healthcare or better providing for our colleges and universities. Really spending the money on almost anything would be better.\n2) Bike lanes do not cause congestion. There is so much evidence saying other wise. The provincial government has provided no evidence showing that they do cause congestion other than a \"feeling\" some frustrated drivers have while sitting in traffic - which is caused by the province not having enough other transportation measures to move people around (including bike lanes!).  Here are some examples:\nhttps://www.cbc.ca/news/science/bike-lanes-impacts-1.7358319\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcsWmI1MIA0\nhttps://www.tvo.org/article/debunking-three-big-myths-about-bike-lanes\n3) When I drive, I feel safer when cyclists are in bike lanes or even better in protected bike lanes. This is because I can clearly see where I belong vs. where the cyclists belong and I don't feel as concerned about a potential collision. On streets where there is no bike lane, it is harder to tell if I am giving cyclists enough space, cars need to slow down and wait for a chance to pass (causing congestion). If you remove the bike lanes, you will not remove the cyclists, they will just move to an active lane. That doesn't do anything to improve congestion\n4) As a cyclists, it is uncomfortable and less safe to bike on streets without bike lanes. Safety of all road users needs to be taken into account in this decision.\n5) Why is the PROVINCIAL government so concerned with matters that are clearly at the MUNICIPAL level? Citizens of different cities have elected their municipal leaders to run their cities. The citizens elected the provincial government to run the province. It should be up to municipalities to decide where and when to add bike lanes or to remove them. Why is the government so clearly overstepping their bounds?\n6) This is not a priority for the people of Ontario. Addressing congestion yes, it is. But there is ZERO evidence that this will help, yet there are evidence based solutions available. Why is the government ignoring those? Do better!\n"

        "comment": "I agree that traffic in Toronto is terrible. I drive a fair amount. But, this proposal will not help with traffic. The data is in - bike lanes do not make traffic worse. Bike lanes help reduce congestion. Remove bike lanes and you will have tens of thousands more cars on the roads every day.\nRemoving bike lanes can also lead to more dead cyclists. Cyclists are not the enemy. Cyclists help keep our province cleaner and healthier. Bike lanes make us safer. We don\u2019t worry about getting doored or hit by cars. As a driver, I prefer separated bike lanes because I feel more comfortable sharing the road this way.\nRemoving completed bike lanes is financially irresponsible. Please do not remove existing bike lanes on Bloor, University and Yonge and force cars and cyclists to share the lane.\nAnd finally, these are municipal issues. Please focus on broader Ontario wide issues that you have jurisdiction over, like investing in regional and mass transit.\nThis policy proposal is shortsighted, politically motivated, not in the interest of Toronto, and contrary to the evidence.\nThank you.\n"

        "comment": "As an Ontarian, I am fundamentally against this proposal.\nWhile not a resident of Toronto, I severely object to the removal of any existing bike lanes in any city in Ontario. I also firmly object to any infrastructure that aims to increase car-centric modes of transportation at the expense of other modes of transportation or transit.\nIncreasing Ontarians options for transit both in and between our cities across the province is crucial to expanding opportunities for all people who either cannot afford a car or are unable to drive a car. Furthermore, increasing transit options such as mass transit and bicycles is in the best interest of those who do use vehicles, as a plurality of transit options will ease gridlock and traffic congestion in the long term.\nIf this is the precedent that current Conservative Ontario provincial government wishes to set for our province, then it would immediately lose my vote at both the local and provincial level. This issue intersects with both my own personal interests and fundamental beliefs in how transit should be handled in our country.\n"

Investing in networks of protected bicycle lanes has significant potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, lower transport costs, prevent road fatalities, and improve the quality of life for people in cities around the globe. I support the construction of more bike lanes.\nUniversity of Colorado Denver has the most comprehensive study of bicycle and road safety to date (May 2019) finds that building safe facilities for cyclists is one of the biggest factors in road safety for everyone. Bicycling infrastructure -- specifically, separated, and protected bike lanes -- leads to fewer fatalities and better road-safety outcomes for all road users. See link attached.\n"

        "comment": "I am strongly opposed to Bill 212. As a daily cyclist and a Toronto resident, I rely on bike lanes to commute safely and efficiently. By choosing to cycle, I\u2019m helping reduce congestion and pollution, making the city more livable for everyone. Removing bike lanes would force cyclists like myself onto busy streets, increasing the risk of accidents and potentially pushing us back into cars, which would only add to traffic and emissions.\nBike lanes on streets like Bloor-Danforth have proven vital for safe commuting. Instead of taking them away, the Ontario government should be investing in more cycling infrastructure to support a healthier, greener, and less congested city.\n"

No traffic lights.  High speeds.  Drivers doing exactly what they want.\nA driver's paradise.\nWhat can go wrong?  Collisions and congestion, every single day.\nPre-pandemic, Toronto experiences 50 to 60 road fatalities annually.  Post pandemic that annual number dropped to 40 to 50.  And those include motorists after pedestrians and the majority.  The lowest rate of fatality was in 2020 when cars were left at home but cycling activity went up.\nWhy is bad driving now the acceptable norm that the government would rather accommodate and prioritize a few minutes of a bad drivers' time over public safety?\n"

        "comment": "I have a number of concerns about bike lanes proposal.\nHyper-local policies have no place in provincial legislation. Residents who actually live in the affected areas are losing their say in how they live via provincial overreach, largely driven by those who do not live here.\nIt is essential for growing cities to enable multi-modal transportation.  This include pedestrian, cycle, transit (bus/LRT/subway,etc), as well as automotive.  Tipping the scales to favour only allow automotive transportation suffocates cities - businesses suffer, and renders cities undesirable places to live.  Cities who yield to car traffic while not allowing other options to thrive do not fair well as they grow, and grow we must.\nToronto is a city of rails and ravines. A common pushback is to tell cyclists to 'just use the side streets'.  Unfortunately, this is not possible in this city - inter-neighbourhood travel is not possible where side streets are cut off by rails and ravines/rivers.  Using the through-fares is the only option, and since embracing bike lanes, I (and my kids) am now able to get around much of the city safely without having to sit in a car.  How tragic is it to have to 'drive to a place where you can bike'?  As important as cars are (and they will continue to be so), cities are for people and we need to make them liveable.\nLook at cities like Utrecht, which wisely chose to not stiffle their city with car traffic, and instead prioritized transit, pedestrian and cycling.  Cars are still there, but they are not the go-to mode of transit, as the other options are simple more efficient.\nA number of BIAs in the city (particularly in the Annex) have realized that enabling cycle and pedestrian traffic is actually good for business.\nI am NOT opposed to debate on bike lanes.  I believe that some areas should have further and ongoing consultation at the municipal level to fine tune what works and what does not.  This is, of course, NOT a provincial matter.  These things need to be decided by those that live here with nimble decision-making, not hampered by provincial overreach.\n"

        "comment": "Removing bike lanes on Bloor, Yonge, and University only helps 0.05% of people who drive to work in the GTHA. 2 million people drive to work in the GTHA, of those it is estimated only 10,000 drive in rush hour in Toronto. One vehicle lane moves 600 to 1600 cars per hour. This level of policy meddling is an over reach on the provincial government. The removal of three bike lanes will not address the congestion on the 401 will and the economic impact on the trucking and commercial industry will be unchanged. Why can\u2019t this government research and actually table real solutions rather than pandering time, money, and resources. This is a disgrace to propose such a regressive policy and then ask working professionals in policy, planning, and engineers to go against their professional recommendations and research to support a selfish, unsupportive transportation policy.\nIf this government wants to actually help with alleviating congestion, they would invest in automobile alternatives rather than wasting money and resources reversing progress.\nIn addition to this, the construction of the 413 will only encourage further sprawl and increase car dependency. This government needs to get serious and actually look at cities that have improved congestion and begin to recommend and implement actual solutions such as better, affordable, reliable, affordable transit, improve safety and access to bike amenities (parking, lanes, driver training), and purchase the 407 or offer trucking and commercial companies a subsidy to get goods moving through the GTHA. Driving and parking has been subsidized far too long, why does it cost 1 to 3 dollars to park my car and transit is $3.30? Why is a parking fine almost four time less expensive than a ttc fine?\nI want to see, as a tax payer, a government that comes with facts, evidence and data before making a policy decision. I have been working and contributing in a professional capacity in the GTHA for 8 years - since this government took over. I can confidentially say this government has ensured that my quality of life has declined. Life is more unaffordable and many of my friends feel the same way and are leaving Ontario. I don\u2019t want to be forced to own a car, I don\u2019t want to have to feel unsafe if I choose to walk, bike or take transit.\nPlease - this is a terrible policy for the reasons stated above.\n"

        "comment": "Thank you for asking for feedback regarding bike lanes on Bloor and Yonge elsewhere in Ontario. Main corridor streets like Bloor are exactly where we need bike lanes, to support the many vulnerable road users in our city, and their creation has come after years of advocacy by community members, as well as planning, consultation, evidence-based policymaking. These lanes make it safer and easier for cyclists to cross the city, while having a minimal impact on drivers, according to all the research. These lanes keep me and my children safe when we are cycling, and make me feel better when I am driving to know that I don't have to dangerously squeeze past cyclists who don't have space of their own.\nCongestion is frustrating in Toronto. Our highways are full, our main streets crammed with cars. Although I cycle to work year-round and bike my small children to school, I am also a driver, so I get the frustration and anger with traffic in the city. Study after study show that bike lanes help small businesses that thrive on local customers and have minimal detrimental effect on traffic congestion. There are many causes of traffic: the increased population density, poor mass transit, massive increase in ride sharing (as shown in multiple studies) and food and other delivery as a new constant presence on our roads, and large ongoing construction projects closing major intersections and rerouting mass transit, not to mention parked cars and poor driving clogging intersections.\nWe need real solutions, not attacks on positive new infrastructure. Please advocate for vulnerable road users. There is real anger and frustration at the slow traffic in Toronto, but the bike lanes did not cause this traffic, and removing them will cause real harm to Torontonians. Any death or injury that comes to cyclists because they don't have this space provided to them on Toronto's major roads is too many.\nSincerely,\n"

        "comment": "Hello, I wanted to write a few concerns following the proposal of bill 212:\n1 - The bill's name seems intentionally misleading to those who don't/won't bother reading about the details of it, and makes it seem like more of a wedge issue. If you're going for a more casual name for the bill, why not something more honest: \"Removing current and potential future bicycle lanes to prioritize car commuters over the safety, time, and money of anyone who desires anything else\".\n2 - Adding more lanes of traffic (including Highway 413) this way would not only have adverse effects of the goal to reduce congestion, but also cause a myriad of other issues from the car dependency this creates. This includes social isolation, discrimination, more expenses, decline in small businesses, and effects to public health. Strong Towns has made an excellent article highlighting all these issues, which I'll link and recommend reading since it describes perfectly the effects policy making like this has on our cities.\n3 - This bill as well as the projects this will spawn will cause huge financial strain on us taxpayers, which is hard to rationalize with the province being in such an immense amount of debt (over 400 billion dollars). If you had to introduce this bill (which you don't), should it not exclude the tearing down of the bike lanes mentioned within it and instead focus on future projects only? I would love to hear back on this, as well as any other notes there might be on what I've written down.\n"

I bike from Ossington to Coxwell 5 days a week year round.\nI dont think that removing these lanes will solve congestion issues. As i bike by cars, they are almost all single occupant vehicles. Why not incentives carpooling? Or take the money that would be used to rip up the bike lanes to make the lanes more accessible in the winter?\nThese are short term fixes to long term issues. I know many people do cycle because of how accessible the lanes are. Taking out the lanes makes cycling more dangerous and therefore incentivizes people to go back to driving.

The congestion via motor vehicles in Toronto is already insane and removing access to bikes isn\u2019t the problem. Construction, confusing street layout and the sheer number of people who drive instead of using readily available public transport options are what cause gridlock. Make public, communal transport better and more accessible to more people and you\u2019ll cut down on cars, which will, in turn, remove the gridlock.\n"
