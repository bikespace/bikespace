        "comment": "This is an absolutely brain-dead policy proposal which flies in the face of logic and surely multiple studies showing the positives (and increased commuting efficacy for car drivers) of creating roads and bike lanes which are safe for cyclists.\nCyclists are not causing more car traffic. They are helping reduce traffic. Removing bike lanes will likely: either reduce the number of cyclists, as some may feel less safe and will in turn potentially use a car and thereby contribute to increased traffic; or cause more cyclists to fully use a lane on the road, as they are legally entitled to but which will then likely slow cars down further, since these cyclists will no longer have a bike lane.\nWhat a joke of a proposal, coming (unsurprisingly) from a joke of a premier.\nSincerely,\nA disappointed Ontarian\n"

        "comment": "The decision by Premier Doug Ford to remove existing bike lanes across Ontario is a reckless and short-sighted move that puts Ontarians\u2019 safety and environmental priorities at risk. His administration\u2019s argument that bike lanes worsen traffic congestion is not only misleading but shows a misunderstanding of how modern cities balance transportation needs.\nFord\u2019s plan, which he claims will help alleviate gridlock, is a step backward in urban planning. Toronto, in particular, has made strides to improve cycling infrastructure to offer safer, greener alternatives for commuters. But instead of embracing this shift, Ford aims to rip up existing bike lanes, threatening the safety of cyclists and pedestrians alike. This policy will not only limit sustainable transportation options but could actively increase congestion by funneling more people into cars \ufffc \ufffc.\nCyclists play a crucial role in reducing traffic, pollution, and the strain on public transportation. By removing bike lanes, the government is ignoring these benefits and overlooking the real issues plaguing Ontario\u2019s roads, such as inadequate public transit infrastructure. Even Toronto Mayor Olivia Chow has criticized Ford\u2019s policy, pointing out that the real congestion problems stem from delayed provincial transit projects like the Eglinton Crosstown and Finch West LRTs, which have caused years of road closures \ufffc.\nMoreover, this heavy-handed interference in municipal decision-making erodes local governance. The Association of Municipalities of Ontario has slammed the move as an overreach, with no clear evidence provided to support the claim that bike lanes are the main culprits behind traffic slowdowns. This is a blatant disregard for the work done by local governments to design systems that prioritize safety and efficiency \ufffc.\nBy pushing forward with this harmful plan, Ford is jeopardizing not just the safety of cyclists but also undermining environmental efforts to promote sustainable travel. It\u2019s time for the province to support, not sabotage, the progress Ontario cities have made. Instead of undoing years of improvement, the focus should be on expanding and maintaining bike lanes to create a truly balanced and forward-thinking transportation system.\n"

        "comment": "This is not a good use of our time and tax dollars. We need to continue to use other forms of transit other than cars. The bike lanes do not effect traffic the extra cars and bad drivers do. Finish improvements to the rail and public transit infrastructure to remove cars from the road. We need to keep the bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "There is absolutely no reason to do this, there is no real data to support the idea of bike lanes adding to gridlock. If anything, it's the opposite: the more safe, reliable options you give people to get around the city, the fewer people feel obligated to drive (thus reducing the number of cars on the road). The people in the city of Toronto do not want this and it is an egregious waste of funds that we could be using to solve the housing crisis and improving public transit. Safe cycling infrastructure is the key to solving the gridlock problem and helping to alleviate pollution caused by car traffic. Please focus your time, energy, and funds on what really matters: improving life for the citizens throughout the entire province of Ontario. In addition to my point above about bike lanes actually being a good thing for alleviating traffic, focusing on bike lanes like this is a massive waste of this province's resources and unfair to the residents who do not live in Toronto. Please use the money that would go towards the removal of bike lanes to support the needs of the communities outside of the GTA.\n"

This is how many of us choose to get around the city. Removing the few bike lanes we have will simply encourage us to drive more often.\nIt is a terrible idea for so many reasons to remove bike lanes and stop the construction of new lanes. Not to mention, the fact that the provincial government has absolutely NO business making these decisions. We voted for a Mayor who believes in the future of our city and who supports cyclist and all vulnerable road users. This is the choice WE made for Toronto and the province has no right taking it away from us.\n"

        "comment": "As a taxpayer who drives and cycles equally as frequently, I am practically begging the government to stay in its lane, like they did regarding the \u201cMore Homes in the Communities we Love Act\u201d, and focus on matters that are actually provincial jurisdiction. Bike lanes save lives. As a driver I know how easy it is to get distracted and hit a cyclist and as a cyclist I know how crucial it is to have a protected lane. There are countless studies, data and evidence that prove dedicated bike lanes ease congestion and improve the success of small businesses. I hope the government drops this charade and focuses on issues we elected them to legislate on: building transit and creating housing around said transit.\n"

It isn\u2019t always practical, even with all those bike lanes where parking should be, and it always slows me down and sometimes causes damage to my truck that can\u2019t just be buffed out.\nBicycles without dedicated bike lanes are going to move into general traffic, resulting in slower overall traffic, further endangering cyclists, and frustrating regular folks who are just trying to get to the gas station to buy a six pack of their favourite beer.\nBikes \u201chave the same rights and responsibilities as drivers\u201c until puzzling, emotionally  legislation like this is introduced.

        "comment": "Cycling lanes are necessary for public safety. It\u2019s easier for cars to drive knowing that cyclists are separated from car lanes. Bikers need assurance that a parked car isn\u2019t going to open its doors into them. We already have all sorts of regulations from traffic lights to seatbelts intended to increase road safety. Bike lanes are just another layer of safety.\nBiking and driving can and do coexist. In my day-to-day life, I typically ride my bike as an alternative to driving. In doing so, I actually reduce traffic by taking another car off the road and thereby make driving better (I always take roads with bike lanes or side streets where available, so I\u2019m not blocking any cars). I am not campaigning against cars. As a car owner myself, I recognize they are and always will be a necessity. I will be the first to admit that driving in Toronto is frustrating. But in my experience this is due to poor drivers, widespread construction, reserving car parking spaces on almost every major street, having slow large vehicles everywhere, and having generally poor road design across the city. It is not because of bike lanes, which take cars off the road.\n"
