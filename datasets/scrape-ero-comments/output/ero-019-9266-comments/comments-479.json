Bike lanes built to pander to a few at the expense of increasing vehicle travel time is insane.\nCase in point is the ongoing construction between Sheppard Ave W & Yonge St - Sheppard Ave E & Bayview Ave (https://maps.app.goo.gl/Xw2xBLtzxGRLmdRW7 ).\nThey have conveniently reduced 2 lanes to 1 lane of traffic either way; with no provision for vehicles turning into small feeder roads.\nTraveling on this key route has become a nightmare where travel times have gone up from 10 mins to 50 mins during peak hours. They have converted this road to a choke point.\nMunicipality do not have the nos (in terms of bikers using the lane) to justify this insanity. It seems like no thought or consideration has gone into the construction of this bike lane.\nThus taking away this decision making process from the Municipality(who seem to engage in vote bank politics) is the right decision.\nThis power should only be given back if and when Sane people are elected to the Municipality.\n"

Generations of Ontarians will have to live with the consequences of pulling transit options out of balance and eliminating safe alternatives to car commuting in our communities. Cars and bicycles can and must coexist and we can make it safer for people to take cars off the road and ease congestion in dense areas by biking. I reject as a lie that there will be any genuine environmental consultation or that the air quality and livability of our cities and communities has gotten even a passing thought. A shameful decision and one I will not support.\n"

        "comment": "As a taxpayer, lifelong resident of Ontario, a long-term resident of Toronto, a pedestrian, cyclist, transit user and driver, I have extensive experience getting around this city on all available forms of transportation, unlike, frankly, many of the MPPs in the Ontario legislature. I strongly object to any bill or amendment to any bill that proposes removing existing infrastructure that is designed to both make people safer in their commutes and to encourage a multi-modal approach to commuting that also takes into consideration environmental impacts. I also object to taxpayer money being used to dismantle these bike routes that are widely used within the GTA. I live on Bloor Street - I see how car traffic flows and how bike lanes are used. It's a system that works! Bloor Street is an obvious smart route for bike lanes because it also runs atop a subway line - no one has any excuse not to take advantage of the subway when travelling into downtown Toronto, even if they are not able or interested in using the Bloor bike lanes. Any legislation that priorities car traffic as a central mode of transport in cities is a step backwards that ignores the data available and the extensive consultation and study that municipalities undertake for these projects, not only in a city like Toronto, but also in cities across the world that prioritize expansions to public transportation, to pedestrian-friendly streets, and support safe routes for cyclists. Be very clear - pedestrians and cyclists are not going anywhere. Even if existing bike lanes are removed, people will still cycle and car gridlock will still proliferate - it will just be more stressful and unsafe for everyone. Cars create gridlock, not bike lanes. Create more lanes for cars and they will simply fill with more cars. People need to be given alternatives to driving that are safe and reasonable. Invest money in transit if you want to make a a real difference in this issue. I am really horrified by this government and the tremendous retrograde decision-making represented in this bill that wantonly panders to an increasingly diminished base of support - as a reminder, this government was formed with only 40.84% of the vote in the lowest turnout of voters in Ontario's history (43.53% of the population voted at all).\n"

        "comment": "The components of this bill that aim to remove bike lanes in dense urban areas has no basis in fact or the fundamentals of urban and transportation planning.\nToronto has simply gotten too large in population to support driving as the primary means of transportation. There is no way around this truth.\nThere is absolutely room for improvement in how bike lanes are designed and deployed, but removing them on thoroughfares such as University Avenue, Bloor Street and Yonge Street will not improve gridlock and will endanger the lives of many more cyclists and children, and add to more vehicles on the road as cycling no longer becomes a viable alternative.\nIf the Province wanted to target congestion in a meaningful way, it would introduce limitations on lane closures caused by construction (both municipal works and any other closure) to reduce multi year closures that are primarily due to municipal tendering policies and poor management of construction projects. It would also provide funding smart traffic signals that would ensure efficient flows of traffic, and allow for more automatic enforcement of no-stopping, intersection blocking and illegal turns.\n"

        "comment": "I am firmly opposed to Ontario Bill 212 (Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024) for several important reasons. The idea of removing bike lanes to reduce traffic congestion is fundamentally flawed and lacks supporting evidence. In reality, eliminating bike lanes will not ease traffic; studies and historical data indicate the opposite. This action is likely to result in more accidents and fatalities, ultimately increasing costs for the city in terms of healthcare, emergency services, and legal expenses.\nToronto\u2019s own historical data underscores this issue. When bike lanes were removed from Jarvis Street in 2011, the city\u2019s data showed that travel times increased and traffic slowed, contradicting the goal of reducing congestion. Removing bike lanes endangers cyclists and discourages sustainable transportation options, leading to greater car dependency and worsening gridlock.\nRather than implementing policies that jeopardize lives and degrade urban infrastructure, the province should invest in areas that directly benefit residents, such as healthcare and education. This strategy would better serve the long-term interests of Ontarians than dismantling bike lanes to appease drivers and suburban commuters.\nIn conclusion, Bill 212 represents a regression for Toronto and the province. Sustainable urban planning should prioritize multimodal transportation solutions that enhance safety, efficiency, and environmental responsibility. The government\u2019s focus should be on creating a livable, accessible city for everyone, not just accommodating those who drive into the city for work.\n"

        "comment": "I support this bill to review/remove bike lanes on some of Toronto's big arteries, such as Bloor St. West and University Avenue. In Bloor West, many of us refer to the Bloor bike lanes as the \"Uber lanes,\" as delivery people are usually the only bikes (or e-bikes) sporadically using the lanes. Meantime, more and more of us try to avoid Bloor, which we can't, despite it becoming a one-lane congestion nightmare.\nI am not anti-bike and I do appreciate the lanes work well on many downtown streets. Unlike Bloor West, those lanes have a good turnout of cyclists. So, there's logic as a commuting strategy.\nHowever, putting bike lanes on University Avenue also seemed unnecessary and overkill, even dangerous, given ambulances' need to reach hospital row. The city has run wild with creating more bike lanes (and those space-grabbing garden planters) than cyclists require.\nIf the province uses reliable usage data (not the sketchy reports that the city so far offers), this will likely support keeping many existing bike lanes. It's irresponsible, however, that the city has spent so much money on lanes that don't make sense and serve to only make Toronto less livable. I hope this bill will rectify the situation.\n"

The best of which would be a public transport lane that\u2019s exclusive, on time, and frequent, so that people prefers to use it since it\u2019s faster than sitting in a car. The second best is bike lane because it moves a lot of people and it\u2019s flexibility and fun/active component for people. When a safe, separated bike land is built, more people want to use it, and hence these people won\u2019t need/ want to drive hence reduces the cars on road, reduces gridlock.\nNot only that, at any given time, a single lane moves a TON more people than a car, which majority of the time only moves one person, and takes up WAY more space on road!\nSo many researches and urban design engineers/ civil engineers have proven time and time again that increasing more driving lanes can only add to grid lock, and sooooooooo many more cities in the world have improved their traffic through reducing driving lanes and increasing bike lanes and other modes of transportation.  How can regulators in Toronto ignore all that?!  Adding bike lanes were the progress that Toronto is taking in the right direction, can\u2019t believe Ford would force our city to go backwards!!!!\nPlease, decision makers, just educate yourself, and don\u2019t let the North American Car industry lobbyists become the sole interest of your decisions. Have a vision for our city, do the right thing. Put more bike lanes in!\n"

The simple fact is that there are TOO MANY CARS. If the problem could be solved by not having bike lanes then there would be no gridlock on the many, many, streets (and highways) in Toronto without bike lanes!\nThe single most important issue here is safety and saving lives. Studies have proved that roads with separated bike lanes are safer for cyclists, pedestrians AND drivers! I know I feel safer driving on Bloor with a single lane of traffic, slower speeds and no car drivers weaving between lanes. Also I prefer to walk along sidewalks where I am further away from car fumes and drivers who don\u2019t pay attention to pedestrians.\nI can\u2019t help feeling this is all about Doug Ford not liking spending an extra minute or two on his car journeys.

        "comment": "Dear Ontario Ministry of Transportation,\nI am writing to express my concern regarding the current provisions in Bill 212, which call for the removal of bike lanes that occupy traffic lanes as a means to reduce gridlock. While addressing congestion is an important goal, removing bike lanes is not the most effective solution, and the data suggests that bike lanes do not significantly contribute to gridlock.\nDedicated bike lanes are a vital part of creating safer, more efficient transportation networks. Removing them not only discourages cycling, but also reduces viable alternatives to car travel, which could ultimately increase traffic and carbon emissions. Rather than eliminating bike lanes, I urge the Ministry to consider other measures that have been shown to effectively reduce congestion, such as:\n1. Prioritizing right-turn lanes at intersections to improve traffic flow.\n2. Removing or restricting on-street parking in high-traffic areas.\n3. Enhancing public transit options and promoting multi-modal transportation.\nThese solutions would address the root causes of congestion while preserving bike lanes, which are essential for promoting sustainable transportation and making our cities more accessible for all road users.\nThank you for considering this perspective, and I encourage you to amend Bill 212 to keep bike lanes in place while focusing on other, more targeted methods of reducing gridlock.\n"

        "comment": "Long-term resident account of bike lane benefit to University Avenue neighbourhood:\nTo whom it may concern,\nI am a citizen living downtown near University Ave. With due respect to the data analysis that must have been involved in your creation of this bill, from my perspective from living in this area for over a decade, the negative effects to traffic congestion have been caused by continuous construction \u2014 not the completed bike lanes. The completed bike lanes have created safety and clarity for drivers and bikers, reducing the uncertainty that comes from sharing the road between very different vehicle types. I have frequented this area by car, bike, walking, transit, and shuttle bus, and I consider all of these modes important. My perspective from living here since 2013 is that the bike lanes have been positive for neighbourhood safety and efficiency. Road construction projects, on the other hand, have been both a disturbance and a cause of major traffic slowdowns, causing drivers to frequently take a significant amount of time to travel between College Street and King Street while construction projects are set up along University Avenue \u2014 whether the construction site is active that day or not. As a result of what I've observed, my guidance objectively is to keep the bike lanes on University Avenue installed (as well as on neighbouring streets), because they are a positive benefit to the community, and to avoid starting an unnecessary construction project to remove the bike lanes, because construction has been the major source of traffic slowdowns (as well as continuous noise pollution in an area that includes residential use, a hospital palliative care unit, a children's hospital, and tourism). I hope these observations help with your deliberations of the bill.\nSincerely,\nRL\n"

Now with two kids, it turns out I don't need a car. I would never have thought growing that it was a possibility. But as it is, I travel to where I want to go faster, and for cheaper, which encourages me to travel more often and participate more in our vibrant economy. It also provides me and others with highly desirable knock-on effects such as living a healthier life, being happier and more benevolent, and decongesting our streets for those who really have to drive. I am not going back to driving in the city ever again, I will move out of the city first. Bill 212 is a troubling, unserious, pandering proposal that will achieve the opposite of its desired effects and be incredibly costly for Ontarians in general and Torontonians in particular, and Canadians as a whole. It is not the way to build denser cities for the challenges of the 21st century.\n"

To the already cynical citizens of this city it appears to be another attempt to support drivers from outside the 416 in favour of those refusing to use transit or pay the true price for the privilege of driving in the city. Because the Province continues to fail to complete transit projects underway cycling infrastructure is even more necessary.  Young adults in Toronto take transit or bike or ride share. They cannot afford car ownership. If transit worked better they and most Torontonians would favour it. We see the environmental benefit. Torontonians want cycling lanes. We need cycling lanes to reduce car usage, keep their living costs down and reduce climate impact. As a taxpayer and driver I strongly prefer bikes to be in a designated lane. It keeps cyclists and drivers apart and both safer. Stop this idiotic waste of taxpayer dollars, wasteful demolition and regressive policy of removing cycling infrastructure.
