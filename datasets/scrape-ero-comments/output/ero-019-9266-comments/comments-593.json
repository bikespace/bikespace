        "comment": "I use the Bloor bike lane nearly every day all year, to commute into work and to travel to see friends and family. It is the safest way to bike across the city because it is a fully separated lane. I am consistently surprised by how busy that bike lane is, I am clearly one of many that use this lane regularly. Removing the bike lane would put so many lives at risk, as people would continue to cycle on Bloor, Yonge and University but would have to weave around cars which only adds to traffic congestion and is incredibly dangerous. I am frankly surprised the province is considering this move at all. It strikes me as a colossal waste of tax payer money to remove something that keeps so many Torontonians safe every day. Please, please, please do not remove the bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "I am NOT in favour of Bill 212 for the following reasons\n- Bike lanes are best designed by local governments (ie cities) that are closer to the needs of the users, not at the Provincial level\n- Removing existing bike lanes is a large waste of taxpayer money already spent plus the additional cost to revert back to car lanes.\n- The nature of transportation in Toronto city core is moving towards electrified small pseudo-vehicles (eg e-bikes, e-scooters).  This trend will continue into the future as it is more efficient and popular.  It must be supported by dedicated lanes\n- Rapid growth of Bike Share ridership is a form of voting by the people of Toronto and should not be ignored.\nThis proposal would take multi-mode transportation backwards just at the time the populations of large cities are increasingly embracing bike lanes\n"

        "comment": "1. Undermines Local Decision-Making\nMunicipal governments are best positioned to understand the needs of their communities. Removing decision-making power from local authorities undermines the democratic process and the ability of municipalities to tailor infrastructure to local priorities, such as promoting sustainable transportation and improving road safety.\n2. Harms Environmental Goals\nEncouraging cycling is a proven strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and combating climate change. Removing bike lanes discourages cycling, pushing more people into cars and increasing vehicle emissions. This conflicts with the government's broader environmental commitments and Canada\u2019s national climate targets.\n3. Increases Traffic Congestion\nContrary to the stated goal of reducing congestion, removing bike lanes often leads to more cars on the road. Bike lanes provide a viable alternative to motor vehicles, particularly in densely populated urban areas. Their removal will shift some cyclists back into cars, exacerbating congestion rather than alleviating it.\n4. Negative Public Health Impacts\nCycling lanes encourage active transportation, promoting physical activity and improving public health outcomes. Eliminating these lanes reduces opportunities for safe cycling, potentially leading to increased healthcare costs and lower quality of life.\n5. Financial and Practical Inefficiency\nThe removal of existing bike lanes, especially well-utilized ones like those on Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue, represents a waste of public resources. The costs associated with dismantling these lanes, redesigning streets, and reintroducing car traffic far outweigh any marginal benefits.\n6. Detrimental to Road Safety\nDedicated bike lanes reduce conflicts between cyclists and motor vehicles, enhancing safety for all road users. Removing these lanes increases the risk of accidents, injuries, and fatalities, particularly in high-traffic urban environments.\n7. Contradicts Broader Transportation Trends\nCities worldwide are expanding cycling infrastructure to address urban mobility challenges, reduce emissions, and enhance livability. This proposal risks positioning Ontario as regressive in transportation planning, making the province less attractive for investment and tourism.\n8. Inadequate Stakeholder Engagement\nWhile the proposal mentions consulting \"targeted stakeholders,\" the broad impacts of removing bike lanes require comprehensive public engagement. Affected communities, including cyclists, pedestrians, businesses, and environmental organizations, must have a say in such significant decisions.\nRecommendations\nInstead of dismantling cycling infrastructure, the Ontario government should:\nFocus on integrating cycling and driving to create a multimodal transportation system.\nExpand public transit options and incentivize sustainable transport.\nCollaborate with municipalities to optimize bike lane placement and design, ensuring they meet local and regional needs.\n"

        "comment": "Complete disagreement with this proposed legislation.\nThis is not the solution to traffic problems, fewer cars is ... also a major example of Government over-reach into municipal affairs. Those without best knowledge making uninformed decisions that will end-up costing the taxpayers LOTS of money to accomplish NOTHING and in fact make things worse. Where I live they are making an effort to make the City more bike friendly and this is being done without any impact on current traffic flows. This bill just add more bureaucracy to the process which will either stop progress but if not, will certainly slow it down and make it more costly.\nToronto is the problem, not the rest of Ontario so for those who do NOT live in the GTA, why are you making laws province wide that extend to areas where this is NOT a problem.\nFrom an environmental perspective it also just seems inappropriate.\nAnyways, for what it is worth those are my comments ... complete disagreement and I think this bill just should not go forward.\n"

        "comment": "I live in downtown Toronto. I walk to work, and bike or drive to do errands. My kids use a combination of side street bike routes and the Bloor street bike lane to get to school.\nI am concerned that removing bike lanes will make cycling less viable as a transportation alternative due to reduced safety. I am also totally unconvinced that removing the lanes will improve motor vehicle congestion. The problem is total volume, not flow. Indeed, removing these bike lanes is likely to increase traffic, because people like me will feel the need to drive my kids around, vs biking.\nI urge the government to reconsider, or at least study, this policy.\n"

My daughter road bikes to work daily and uses the bike lanes on University and other bike lanes in the city. I am very worried/angry at this proposal and the disregard for human life that it implies.\n"

I have watched the Eglinton bicycle lane near Bathurst where I live transform a Metro roads thoroughfare to a community oriented street. The streetscape is the hope for many small businesses along Eglinton who have been savagely hurt by the continuing Crosstown boondoggle.\nThe bike lane, as elsewhere along Bloor and Yonge, is the environmental friendly, re-vitalizing choice for Toronto's present and future.\n"

        "comment": "I am strongly opposed to bill 212. The bill and its ensuing regulations should be rescinded immediately.\nRegarding the bill giving power to the province to remove bike lanes and determine where bike lanes get built in municipalities, this is significant and unwarranted provincial overreach. Municipal councils should be in charge of determining what street design and modes of transportation are best for their residents, not the province. Bill 212 will also reduce the number of transportation options available to ontarians, put the safety of vulnerable road users at risk, lead to worse pollution and health outcomes, and create even more gridlock by clogging our streets with more cars and trucks. The province should stop meddling in municipal decision-making and stay focused on key provincial areas of jurisdiction like healthcare, education and housing.\nI am also opposed to the measures in Bill 212 that enable streamlined highway development. The bill further removes environmental protections and takes away the rights of landowners. I also feel that First Nations were not consulted adequately on this bill.\nI am disgusted by Bill 212. It should be stopped in its tracks immediately.\n"

        "comment": "First off, I strongly believe that the Province needs to stay in its own lane!  Reducing gridlock and removing bicycle lanes are clearly a local concern and local officials, in consultation with the local people, need to be the ones who make these decisions.\nSecondly, I strongly believe that the best way to reduce gridlock is by strengthening the public transport system.  I live in Toronto and the state of the TTC is atrocious.  An affordable smooth running TTC with frequent service would draw many people out of their cars  resulting in less gridlock and cleaner air... good for people and good for the environment.\nFinally, I strongly believe that removing bike lanes will endanger lives, including my own.  I am at various times a pedestrian, a cyclist and a driver.  Bike lanes help to keep cyclists safe and removes the temptation to ride on sidewalks, endangering pedestrians.  Drivers also feel safer with the clarity that bikes lanes give regarding who should be where.\n"

Less bike lanes mean more cars and more gridlock.\nWe also need more separation and continuity of bike lanes to increase cycling.

        "comment": "It is an absolute overreach of the Provincial government to step in to tell a municipality to change something because they randomly decided that I causes a problem for drivers. For a Conservative government who argues for less government it is even more ludicrous. The economic unsustainability of providing more lanes for cars has forced cities and municipalities to plan for more public and active transportation in order to lessen the burden on infrastructure. It has been proven that towns that plan and build for the car to take priority are going bankrupt. But this move to remove bike lanes tells the City it doesn't matter I you are seeking wiser options we will saddle you with the car as your top option. This Bill is wrong. PERIOD! Please reconsider and scrap it!\n"

If you remove bike lanes they do not just vanish, you are forcing them into cars thus adding to the congestion.

        "comment": "Please don\u2019t move forward with this proposal.  I use the Bloor and University bike lanes nearly every workday, including in Winter, to commute from bloor and Runnymede to downtown Toronto.\nThere is room for improvement in how traffic is managed on these streets related to construction and the number of traffic lights at minor intersections (especially in Etobicoke).  However, we also know that increasing the number of traffic lanes simply induces more car demand, offsetting any time savings.\nIt would be extremely shortsighted to remove the bike lanes which provide an excellent alternative to driving.  There is simply not enough room downtown for everyone to drive. Cycling is the way of the future.  It takes less space and is more environmentally friendly.  Cyclists are also the happiest commuters (see the book Happy City).\nIt is wholly inappropriate for the province to interfere in municipal jurisdiction.   It\u2019s so transparently driven by Doug Ford and some folks in your Premier\u2019s Office.\nIs the province really going to spend $50 million dollars to improve Doug Ford\u2019s commute downtown in his big SUV?\nDo Ministry of Transportation staff have any independence to actually provide policy advice to political decision-makers?  Or are you just implementing arbitrary directives?\nMoving forward, this government will be directly responsible for the injuries and deaths of every cyclist in the city who is hit by a car.  Human life is far more valuable than motorist convenience.\n"
