        "comment": "Removing bike lanes would make streets less safe for cyclists and pedestrians, potentially leading to more accidents and traffic congestion, as cyclists would be forced into car lanes. Bike lanes encourage biking over driving, which helps reduce pollution, ease traffic, and improve public health through active transportation. Economically, bike lanes attract local business and boost property values by creating more attractive, livable neighborhoods. They also provide an affordable transportation option for non-drivers, making cities more inclusive and sustainable overall. In short, bike lanes benefit safety, the environment, health, and local economies.\n"

        "comment": "To the City of Toronto,\nI would strongly encourage reconsideration of any proposal aimed at removing bike lanes on key streets like Bloor, Yonge, and University. Preserving and even expanding our bike infrastructure is essential for easing traffic in Toronto\u2014not only now, but for the future. Bike lanes provide a crucial alternative to car travel, allowing more people to get around safely and efficiently without adding to the volume on our roads. Removing these lanes would only shift more people to car usage, compounding congestion and taking us further from sustainable transportation goals.\nAdditionally, we should consider the broader context. The Gardiner Expressway, as we\u2019ve all seen, has increasingly shown its limitations in supporting our city\u2019s traffic load. Reducing bike infrastructure will not alleviate pressure on the Gardiner or our main roads. Instead, it will lead to more cars on the road and exacerbate the existing bottlenecks.\nWe know that prioritizing bike lanes can reduce vehicle congestion by encouraging alternative commuting options. Cities around the world have proven that a robust cycling network helps decrease traffic and carbon emissions while improving overall livability. By making it safer and more convenient for people to choose cycling over driving, Toronto can lead the way in sustainable urban planning and build a more resilient, accessible city for all.\nLet\u2019s look toward a future where sustainable commuting options are prioritized over outdated car-centric planning.\n"

Removing the bike lanes will not make any difference to rush hour traffic. Instead of 1 lane of stopped cars, we will have 2 lanes of gridlock and more injuries and deaths to those using bikes.\nDo not let a Provincial body tell us what to do in Toronto.

The city has made it abundantly clear that policy will favour implementing bike lanes with limited consideration to the negative externalities. Bike lanes remove funding from the TTC and road space from cars, both of which are essential to a functioning city.\nHowever given the financial state of the city and province, I do not support removing the bike lanes already implemented on University, Yonge, and Bloor. The cost-benefit does not justify the cost to remove the infrastructure.\n"

To remove these lanes that were just put in would be dangerous for pedestrians, cyclists, as well as a massive waste of tax payer money. This proposal is frankly rediculous and the Ford government should put money into funding public transit to encourage less use or cars which would reduce grid lock.

        "comment": "Why is the government continuing to follow a failed policy of building your way out of gridlock, yet here we are in 2024 still trying to build your way out of gridlock. Common sense will tell you more roads, will create more traffic, the traffic then complains that there is too much traffic. Common sense will also tell you that the only way stop gridlock is to reduce the number of trips people make by car. To do that you have to improve the transit infrastructure bus/LRT/subway and even bike lanes and build places that don't need a car to get to in the first place {Ontario Line will not be any help to me}. Bike lanes are a part of this improved infrastructure and yet you think that removing them will cause gridlock, think again. At least people are safe in their protected lanes and anything that slows down car traffic will get my vote, if I have to ride my bike in a car lane then traffic will have to move it my speed, frustrating drivers and ultimately cause more accidents many fatal, how long is a road closed for a fatality. All very well telling me I should use secondary street when my destination will be one main. If you are a party of business, then why going to hurt them by removing the lanes. Are you going to remove on street parking on all the main roads downtown after all they also take up one lane that could be used to relieve gridlock.\nTHINK AGAIN\n"

        "comment": "Opposition to Ontario Bill 212: Prioritizing Safe and Sustainable Transportation\nI am firmly opposed to Ontario Bill 212 (Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024) for several compelling reasons. This legislation\u2019s proposal to remove bike lanes as a strategy to alleviate traffic congestion is fundamentally misguided and lacks substantial evidence to support its effectiveness. Rather than easing congestion, this policy is likely to lead to adverse outcomes, compromising both public safety and sustainable urban development.\nHistorical Lessons: Removing Bike Lanes Does Not Ease Congestion\nToronto\u2019s own history with similar measures demonstrates why this proposal is likely to fail. In 2011, bike lanes were removed from Jarvis Street with the aim of improving traffic flow; however, the city\u2019s own data subsequently revealed increased travel times and slower traffic\u2014precisely the opposite of what was intended. This precedent underscores the ineffectiveness of eliminating bike lanes as a means of reducing gridlock. Instead, it risks pushing more people toward car dependency, exacerbating congestion and increasing the strain on road infrastructure.\nPublic Health and Safety Risks\nRemoving bike lanes endangers cyclists and other vulnerable road users. The absence of dedicated lanes for cyclists has been shown to increase accidents, injuries, and fatalities. These preventable incidents result in higher healthcare costs, emergency response expenses, and legal fees\u2014all of which ultimately burden taxpayers. Protecting bike lanes is not only a matter of safety but also an economically sound choice that reduces long-term public health expenditures.\nPromoting Sustainable and Multimodal Transportation\nSustainable urban planning should prioritize multimodal transportation solutions, encouraging walking, cycling, and public transit over car dependency. Bill 212 moves us further from these goals by diminishing the infrastructure for safe, sustainable travel options. As global cities increasingly adopt green policies and expand biking infrastructure, Ontario risks lagging behind, both in terms of environmental responsibility and in creating a livable, accessible city for all residents.\nAlternative Investments for the Greater Good\nRather than dismantling urban infrastructure, the province should direct resources toward initiatives that offer broad, lasting benefits. By investing in healthcare, education, and efficient public transit systems, Ontario can address core issues affecting residents\u2019 quality of life while also easing congestion more effectively. Such measures would serve the long-term interests of Ontarians far better than temporary, reactionary fixes aimed solely at accommodating suburban commuters and drivers.\nConclusion: A Step Backward for Ontario\nBill 212 is ultimately a step backward for Ontario\u2019s cities and communities. Sustainable, inclusive urban planning calls for policies that prioritize safety, efficiency, and environmental stewardship. By preserving and expanding bike lanes, the government can foster a safer, more accessible cityscape that supports all modes of transport and contributes to a cleaner environment. Rather than catering solely to drivers, Ontario should adopt forward-thinking policies that build a resilient, inclusive future for all its residents.\n"

        "comment": "As a motorist and Toronto resident who drives downtown to access services/cultural events, I support and want bike lanes on major roads. It is more efficient to have bike lanes and I submit that it actually speeds up traffic by reducing the chaos of bikes in the roadway where there are cars. I specifically choose the 3 major roads that Ford has identified because of the bike lanes, feeling more secure in driving my car, not having to watch for bikes darting in and out of traffic.\nIf you take out the bike lanes of these major roads, the bikers will still use the roads. There will be more congestion and more traffic accidents and fatalities. It's foolish and lacking evidence to take out these bike lanes.\nI propose that instead, you create more bike lanes to keep motorists and bikers apart, and safe.\nThe issue of congestion is due to construction and yes, too many cars. The issue is the 401/DVP congestion, not the city streets. And if out of city boundary drivers paid an entry tax on the DVP, perhaps we'd have more money to work on the TTC/and street improvements.\nFurther, if the TTC felt safer, with attendants on every train,  walking the length of the train, and on platforms, I would feel safer and would use it more.\nAlso if AQI was posted on the platforms, in the cars and buses, like in France and other jurisdictions, along with windows on buses were cracked open, I would feel safer using the TTC and use it. Also signs recommending masking for patrons and employees would help.  Right now, the anti vax and anti mask crowd, encouraged by Doug Ford's lack of action, and silence on COVID in this continuing pandemic, has resulted in me feeling too vulnerable wearing a mask on public transit. What a shame that those who are taking precautions and protecting others are being treated this way.\n"
