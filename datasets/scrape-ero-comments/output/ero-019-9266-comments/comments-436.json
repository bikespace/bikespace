I feel safer on bike lanes and not sure how removing them and having bikes and cars in the same lane - could be better than what we have. I have witnessed first hand travelling out of a bike lane does - as I saw the female cyclist after she got hit by a truck on Bloor in Yorkville this summer. It was tragic and preventable.\nNot only will cyclists be denied safety if the bike lanes are removed - it will add chaos with all the ebike food delivery vehicles. Not to mention scooters too.\nDedicated lanes save lives. Adding bikes and scooters to traffic is a recipe for more deaths. Main arteries are also serviced by transit so why are we re-prioritizing cars above all else? Ontario should also not be meddling in Toronto\u2019s streets. This is overstepping.\n"

        "comment": "A modified (removing identifying information) version of an email shared with my PC MPP asking them to not support this bill:\n```\nI know the PC government is committed to keeping Ontario moving, but I have strong concerns with the proposed changes to bike lane policy put forward in Bill 212. I live in the GTA (not Toronto) and regularly bike to work my municipality's city center. While uneven/damaged paths, dangerous drivers and construction can make this challenging, advantages like gas money savings, healthy exercise and the fact that it's just as fast make this a worthwhile option.\nThe Ford decision to rip out Toronto bike lanes impacts me here in the GTA. It is a poor use of my provincial tax dollars by being spent on a separate Municipality's infrastructure. While I do occasionally drive and bike in Toronto, the best science shows this will not improve drivetime by causing latent demand and forcing people who otherwise would have biked to take up more space in a car. But worst, the approvals needed by Bill 212 stops my municipality from being able to improve my commute by adding red tape.\nAs a constituent in your riding who would be harmed by Bill 212, I urge you to oppose this bill. Let's avoid wasteful spending and help keep the province moving by focusing our efforts on better options.\n```\n"

        "comment": "Feedback on Bill 212 \u2013 Alternatives to Support Ontario\u2019s Economic and Environmental Goals\nDear Ministry of Transportation,\nI am writing in response to the proposed Bill 212, the Reducing Gridlock, Saving You Time Act, 2024. While I understand the intention to reduce congestion and improve transportation efficiency, I believe that removing bike lanes on Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue could ultimately hinder these goals. Instead, alternatives that promote cost-effective infrastructure, reduce long-term congestion, and support environmental priorities would offer more sustainable solutions.\n1. Increased Safety Risks for Cyclists and Drivers\nRemoving bike lanes would significantly increase the risk of accidents and endanger both cyclists and drivers. Bike lanes provide a safe, designated space for cyclists, reducing the likelihood of collisions. Without dedicated bike lanes, cyclists are forced to share lanes with motor vehicles, leading to more unpredictable interactions and higher accident rates. Studies show that streets with protected bike lanes see a reduction in cyclist injuries by as much as 90% (City of Toronto, 2023). By keeping bike lanes in place, we can maintain a safer environment for all road users, reducing accident-related costs and ensuring that both cyclists and drivers feel safe and secure on our roads.\n2. Long-Term Congestion Management and the Issue of Induced Demand\nResearch consistently shows that adding capacity for motor vehicles\u2014whether through road expansion or lane reallocation\u2014often leads to a phenomenon known as \"induced demand.\" When more lanes are made available for cars, additional drivers are attracted to those routes, causing traffic to eventually return to previous levels or even worsen. A study by the Transportation Research Board found that expanding road capacity typically reduces congestion only temporarily, with traffic levels returning to the same or higher volumes within a few years (Transportation Research Board, 2019). By reallocating bike lanes for cars, the congestion problem is likely to persist as more vehicles fill the available space.\nConversely, studies indicate that cities with robust cycling and public transit infrastructure experience more sustainable congestion relief. By maintaining bike lanes and encouraging their use, Toronto can gradually reduce car dependency, thus addressing the root causes of congestion rather than merely offering short-term relief. This approach not only benefits drivers by reducing road demand but also supports Ontario\u2019s goals for economic and environmental sustainability.\n3. Economic Savings from Bike Lane Maintenance\nFrom a fiscal perspective, maintaining bike lanes is significantly more cost-effective than maintaining roads designed for motor vehicles. Car lanes require frequent repairs and resurfacing, largely due to the wear and tear caused by heavier vehicles. In contrast, bike lanes incur only a fraction of these costs, as bicycles impose far less stress on road surfaces. The City of Portland, for example, found that its bike infrastructure required substantially less maintenance and, over time, saved millions in road repair costs (City of Portland, 2018). Investing in bike lanes, therefore, represents a long-term financial savings opportunity, allowing taxpayer funds to be allocated to other essential services.\nFurthermore, the savings from reduced road maintenance costs can be reinvested into Ontario\u2019s infrastructure. These funds could help support initiatives like road safety improvements, public transit enhancements, and other infrastructure projects that drive economic growth and improve public services.\n4. Supporting Economic Growth with Efficient and Sustainable Transportation\nImproving traffic flow supports Ontario\u2019s economy, as it enhances the movement of goods and people. However, by focusing only on car infrastructure, we may limit the economic potential that diverse transportation modes provide. Dedicated bike lanes reduce congestion by creating a predictable and organized flow of traffic, which benefits drivers, cyclists, and public transit users alike. Cities that invest in cycling infrastructure often see more economic activity and greater ease of access to local businesses, creating a positive environment for small businesses and increasing consumer traffic.\nResearch from Copenhagen shows how a comprehensive cycling network can contribute up to $1 billion annually to the economy by reducing congestion, improving commute times, and attracting new business investment (Buehler & Dill, 2021). In the same way, Ontario\u2019s economy could see similar benefits if efforts are focused on promoting cycling and multi-modal transport as cost-effective and sustainable alternatives to expanding car lanes.\n5. Reducing Healthcare Costs by Supporting Active Transportation\nIn addition to reduced infrastructure maintenance costs, bike lanes contribute to public health goals. By encouraging active commuting through safe bike lanes, Ontario can achieve substantial healthcare savings. A study by Toronto Public Health estimated that a 10% increase in cycling could save millions in health costs each year. With fewer traffic-related injuries and increased physical activity, public health improves, translating into economic savings that benefit all residents.\n6. Aligning with Ontario\u2019s Environmental Goals and Reducing Emissions\nOntario\u2019s environmental plan highlights the importance of lowering greenhouse gas emissions while promoting economic growth. Supporting cycling infrastructure aligns directly with this objective. By reducing car dependency, particularly for short trips, Ontario can decrease traffic congestion, improve air quality, and contribute to lower urban emissions. The World Health Organization estimates that a 10% shift from car to bicycle commuting could reduce urban CO\u2082 emissions by up to 10% (WHO, 2022), helping Ontario meet its climate targets without compromising economic activity.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, while reallocating bike lanes to car lanes may seem a quick solution to reduce congestion, it poses significant drawbacks in terms of long-term traffic management, public safety, and infrastructure costs. Prioritizing sustainable transportation infrastructure, such as bike lanes, aligns with Ontario\u2019s economic and environmental goals by reducing long-term costs, improving road safety, and supporting a vibrant, efficient economy. I urge the Ministry of Transportation to consider these alternative perspectives and to continue building on Ontario\u2019s progress toward a balanced and sustainable transportation system that meets the needs of all residents.\nThank you for considering these points.\nSincerely,\nSources\nBuehler, R., & Dill, J.

        "comment": "Good day,\nI am writing regarding removing of bike lanes which my wife and I do not support.\nWe live very close to Bloor and Yonge street and visit both quite often. Recently we have been on Bloor and I was standing outside and was watching traffic, both cars and bikes. Quite often on a bike lane there were 8-10 or sometimes even more people riding a bike at any given 5 minutes time period. Now imagine, all those people going back to the cars if those bike lanes are removed. I would like to emphasis the number of people: 8 to 10 people in 5 minutes! It's around 100+ people in an hour! Please try to visualize the sheer number of cars on a road instead of a single bike lane. I do - it will be a nightmare.\nOf course, you could say, not everyone will get back to the cars: some will still ride bikes (I am sure not a lot because it's not going to be safe anymore), some will choose to walk or take public transit. Public transit is another painful topic here, but to simplify it, it's not going to be viable for many who ride the bike. They are choosing cycling not without a purpose behind it: it is quick, it is (or has become recently) safe, relatively cheap and very reliable (that you cannot say about the public transportation). Thus, why removing this option?\nThis mode of transportation is crucial, especially in the downtown and other areas with high population density, mainly because there is not much space (ta-da!). Where less cars will benefit the areas much more in the long run than the vice versa: less noise, dust and more space. The bike lanes, in my opinion, also make streets look much more pleasing to the eye in comparison to what it was before.\nMy wife and I lived in the Netherlands for 10 months before moving to Canada in 2015 and we, to this day, do not own a car but don't cycle either. We don't do the latter because it is still not safe, in our opinion. We live near Avenue Rd and St. Clair, where the bike lanes haven't unfortunately reach us yet, therefore we feel that way. Whereas, during the 10 months being in the Netherlands, we loved renting the bikes (we would buy a permanent bike if we knew we would stay there permanently) and enjoying cycling in the country side or the city. If you ask any Dutch person if they would like to remove the bike lanes - they would say \"No\". Because it is now a part of their culture. Even though, it was a painful process of removing car and installing bike lanes at some point in 70s or 80s (I don't remember exactly) - everyone now agree that it was a correct decision. And we here in Ontario are trying to destroy this important step forward and move back the decade? We are already 40-50 years late! It just does not sound right.\nLet's go back to 2015. Bloor and Yonge at that point in time both had 2 car lanes, correct? But were all those car lanes used for traffic? No. The nearest lane to the side walk had always been a place for parking. Essentially, making the 2 lanes road into 1 lane anyway. Ok, not exactly 1 lanes but 1.5. But would the car be able to shrink into that 0.5 lane? No it would not. Therefore, we cannot talk about those roads as full 2 lane roads. And back in 2015 both Yonge and Bloor were un-drivable. There were always issues with traffic. Even though, we are pedestrians, we still notice it. We noticed how bad the traffic was on those streets, it does not look any different now with bike lanes (in regards to traffic). Not even a little (with an exception, that the cyclists are now protected and can move almost without any restrictions in the direction where they want to go instead of being stuck in traffic; and the street looks much nicer and it is pleasant to walk on it).\nI would also like to pay attention to a very smart planning of the bike lanes in those streets. Even though, the lane on those roads were removed, parking spaces were not! Maybe, there is less parking... maybe... but not by much. And those parking spaces do not block the traffic lanes anymore how it was in 2015! I would just like to congratulate the city planners with this achievement, it is truly remarkable. And now you want to remove this achievement? That is unthinkable.\nThere are many other comments that I would like to make which would oppose this bill in its entirety, but I do not have much time, unfortunately, at this time. I have decided to make this comment when I learnt that I can do it.\nThe only additional thought that I would like to make that in my opinion, the deterioration of the road condition is mostly related to the boom of construction projects (University Ave. especially) in the city that it has not seen in the decades and many people are still reluctant of abandoning their vehicles as the mode of transportation. Mainly, because of a current situation with a public transportation. It is in a bad state (even though it is questionably better that anywhere in NA, it is still far behind Europe). Yes, the introduction of Presto was a crucial achievement, but since then not much is done. The subway is unreliable, every time I go down there I don't know when I will get to the point of my trip (and if I get there in time). It has become unsafe and in some cases dirty and unpleasant to use - it is much nicer to be in your own vehicle than riding in the subway, even if you are stuck in traffic. Streetcars, at least on St Clair line (512), are very unreliable as well: a lot of bunching and not sticking to the schedule. Quite often the wait time there is 15 or more minutes. Thus, my wife and I often take Uber/Taxi (which is expensive but not as much as owning the car) or simply walk home/to work because it is faster to do so than waiting for the next street car. Then I ask it again, why do we spend time, attention, energy and tax money on removing something that is so beneficial to the society as the bike lanes and not spend all of it on fixing the public transportation? That's just beyond me. A good and reliable public transportation will ease the traffic pressure in the city in addition to the bike lanes - removing the bike lanes will never fix issues with subway/streetcars/buses and therefore traffic issues.\nThank you for taking your time to read this through. I hope I described my point of view sufficiently to plant the doubts into this plan. And I apologize for my grammar and some inconsistent writing style because I don't have time to make it better.\nBest Regards\nYour Canadian citizens\n"

They make me feel safer and helps ensure that I get to my destinations alive, especially the ones with concrete infrastructure instead of painted bike paths. My friends are increasingly considering riding bikes as it is faster, safe and also able to live a healthier lifestyle, partly due to the completion of the bloor and university bike lanes. They are essential infrastructure for the city!\nI also drive from time to time in the city and more cyclists on the road means less cars in lane which reduces congestion. I feel safer when I am driving on university which has its own protected bike lanes instead of a painted bike path. When I would like to go somewhere, it is only logical to choose the fastest and safest way to get to the destination. By maintaining and expanding the current bike infrastructure on Bloor, University and Yonge, we provide choices for the people instead of limiting everyone to only cars.\n"

If people are not able to bike, because they do not feel safe sharing a lane with cars, and choose to drive instead, this will increase the number of cars on the road and increase traffic, which is the exact opposite of what this bill proposes will happen.\nMillions will be spent on ripping up perfectly functional, brand new bike lanes, while our education and healthcare systems collapse under this premier's watch. This bill will actively set transportation in Ontario back decades, leaving us to fall behind the rest of the western world.\nWhy are bikers not given the same safety and assurance as drivers? Are they not worthy in the premier's view? Or does he simply not care? Without dedicated bike lanes, bikers will have to occupy a lane of traffic as they are entitled and instructed to within the Ontario Highway Act, which would just add to the traffic already plaguing our streets.\n"

The bike lanes have cut my husband\u2019s travel time to work in half because he now bikes to work regularly. My kids, who are in their 20\u2019s, also use the bike lanes regularly. The bike lanes slow the traffic speed, which in turn makes travel for pedestrians and bikers more safe.\nThere is no real good reason why traffic has to move quickly through these areas.

        "comment": "I strongly oppose Bill 212. It represents a massive overreach of the provincial government's power. The province should not be stepping in and blocking construction of or removing bike lanes in cities, as they are valuable transportation infrastructure. Bicycle lanes save lives, help businesses, and provide residents with reliable transportation options. This bill would be a massive step backwards for making transportation efficient and reliable, because more bicycle infrastructure ultimately means more people will opt to bike rather than drive, in turn reducing congestion on roads. It simply doesn't make sense for the provincial government to be wasting time and taxpayer money meddling in municipal infrastructure projects like bike lanes, which have been shown around the world to be a net-benefit for transportation in countless cities. Let local voters decide how their cities should be built. The province does not adequately represent local municipal voters and does not understand our local needs. We need safe and expansive bicycle infrastructure.\nIn addition, rather than attempting to spend billions of dollars on car infrastructure by continually expanding highways (despite the fact that these projects always end up inducing more driver demand and thus likely making car traffic worse in the long run), we would be much better served by investing in public transit infrastructure, which \"pays dividends\" in the long run by reducing the amount of people who need to drive a car every day, freeing up our existing roads, while making transportation more accessible to those for whom driving is not a viable option. This demographic includes children, seniors, people who cannot afford to own a car, people living with disabilities, and more. In short; Bill 212 works against the best interests of Ontarians.\n"

Here are my primary concerns:\n1. Adding Red Tape and Bureaucracy: This bill oversteps provincial boundaries by requiring that new bike lanes receive provincial approval. Decisions about bike lanes should remain a municipal responsibility, free from excessive provincial red tape and bureaucracy. Adding this level of oversight does not serve the city's best interests or address its unique transportation needs.\n2. Everyday Transportation: As someone who relies on bike lanes daily, I can attest to the safety and peace of mind they provide. They allow cyclists like me to travel safely, separate from high-speed car traffic, offering a vital transportation option.\n3. Perspective as a Driver: When I\u2019m behind the wheel, I appreciate having cyclists protected by dedicated lanes. Keeping bike traffic separate enhances road safety for all users and promotes smoother traffic flow. Removing bike lanes would put cyclists and drivers alike at increased risk.\n4. Reducing Car Congestion: The real solution to reducing car traffic lies in offering reliable, fast, and safe alternatives to driving. Protected bike lanes provide exactly that, helping to decrease dependency on cars by encouraging cycling as a viable option for short and medium distances.\n5. Last-Mile Connectivity: Bike lanes are essential for last-mile connections to transit hubs, enabling seamless travel between public transit and final destinations. Reducing bike lane infrastructure would directly impact this critical link and discourage transit use overall.\nBill 212\u2019s focus is misguided; dedicated bike lanes are not an obstacle to better traffic flow\u2014they are an essential part of a well-rounded, efficient, and sustainable transportation network.\n"

        "comment": "This Bill is the single worst piece of proposed legislation I have ever come across in Canada. Bike lanes are essential transportation infrastructure for a significant and growing portion of the population, especially in Toronto. Those who cannot drive, whether for economic or health reasons, as well as those who would like to do their part in avoiding catastrophic climate change in the coming decades, will be left with worse transportation options if this bill is passed. Furthermore, the idea that removing bike lanes would alleviate traffic congestion is incorrect and an extremely short-sighted view. Adding additional car lanes to individual streets does not help significantly reduce traffic because it simply moves the traffic bottleneck to other streets in the grid. However, allowing drivers to take alternate forms of transportation, such as cycling, helps immensely with reducing traffic because it removes cars from the road, the things that cause all the traffic. Many people who currently use the bike lanes in Toronto, or who would use future bike lanes, will instead drive, making traffic much worse. Those who choose to continue cycling or who have to continue cycling (because they still need to go places) will instead bike in the car lanes, which will both increase traffic and cause people to die in inevitable collisions between bikes and cars.\nThe current provincial government seems steadfast in making Toronto the least functional city in the country. While our counterparts in Quebec and BC have noticed that cars are an inefficient method of moving large numbers of people in dense cities, Ontario is not only refusing to accept that fact, but is also actively going against the clear desires of the people of Toronto (through their municipal government) who want to see the city they live in continue to grow and modernize. The government makes arguments using outdated and misleading census data to make this seem like a \"common sense\" bill, but it goes against established research and will make the lives of Torontonians worse.\nThe government also publicly stated that they would look to add bike lanes to side streets when removing or not approving them on main roads. Yet there is nothing in this bill mentioning that intention. Cars are inefficient and relatively unsafe for travel in Toronto. Building a comprehensive transit (this part is going fairly well) and bike lane (this part would be going well if the city of Toronto municipal government were allowed to do its job) network will improve transportation around the city and actually improve congestion in the process by removing cars from the road. If Doug Ford doesn't understand this, he should let the people of Toronto (not the suburbs) do what they want because we, at least, seem to.\n"
