        "comment": "Hi I am writing to provide my feedback as a long time car driver and cyclist. I am speaking from my personal experience having cycle-commuted 3 years (more than 18,000kms) in Toronto and as a driver who drove often between cities in Ontario (20,000kms per year).\nI fully disagree with the proposal to remove bike lanes if it resulted in a lane reduction for cars. Having heard this proposal, I cannot believe the Ontario government can be such backwards thinking and has the audacity to propose a bill that will waste my taxpayer money on undo-ing the good work that cities have done in encouraging healthier and more sustainable means of transportation.\nHaving been stuck in traffic congestion for many of my driving kilometers, the issues are not because we are having bike lanes. Highway congestions are due to the large amount of users (I am aware that myself is a driver on the road and adds to the congestion), accidents caused by reckless driving, constructions and road closures. These can be resolved by:\n1. building more transit for people to NOT use cars as a primary mean of transportation to get to places. When transit takes longer than driving, it is easy to see why people would choose to drive their cars. We need to invest in public transit that is reliable and high frequency, instead of spending the money uselessly removing bike lanes which will not help with relieving congestion.\n2. better enforcement in policing bad driving behaviour. A reckless driver that caused an accident on the highway resulting in road closures impact thousands getting stuck in traffic. We need to enforce the traffic rules and promote better driving that prevents accidents causing road closures.\n3. constructions and road closures need to be planned out carefully to reduce the impact during rush hours. Often times lanes are closed without construction happening, or slow progress on construction causes congestion impacting commute time.\nWhen bike lanes are removed from cities, it WILL kill people. As a government for people, I thought the Ontario government would care about this fact. Bike lanes make commute safer, promotes more people using them, and avoiding a lot of conflict points with drivers that can be inattentive and careless. Having bike commuted myself, I had so many close calls when biking on the road with other drivers, because they are not aware that when there is no bike lane, we will have to take the road because at the end of the day, we have to get to places. I was happy to see that the city of Toronto has added so many bike lanes in the past 5 years, and cycling has become safer and more accessible for people, but the work is not done yet - there NEEDS to be more CONTINUOUS bike lanes, even if it takes up a driving lane (yes, I said it as a driver myself!).\nDriving is a privilege, NOT an entitlement. Being comfortable in a car, being able to afford a car does not give you the rights to think that you are a more superior being than a pedestrian or a cyclist. We need to SHARE the rights of mobility, and by sharing, means equality in terms of safety. What gives the Ontario government the right to remove bicycle lanes that move so many people in the city from places to places, just to keep on-street parking that takes up even more space while moving zero people when the car is parked? Why don't we start by banning on-street parking to free up another lane of traffic in big cities like Toronto?\nWith the Bloor St project, Yonge St, and King St, these city studies have shown that the local business was not impacted by the reduction of car lanes, but in fact, has promoted more spending. Even most customers who arrived on those places do not arrive on car.\nI strongly urge the government to embrace urban transportation and transit planning design and do NOT pass this bill. Biking and better transit planning are the solutions to the car congestion; we need to get more people out of their car driving from places to places to reduce congestion, not encouraging as that induces more demand and caused more congestion in the future.\nThank you.\n"

        "comment": "A blatant waste of taxpayers money, with the sole intent of reducing their quality of life and pushing through workarounds nobody is asking for. 413 project should not be exempt from environmental protection measures, bike lanes should stay and be expanded upon. Scrap the whole bill and invest in high speed rail, or reworking public transit in Toronto.\nCongestion will only be reduced if there are viable alternatives to driving, of which there are currently zero. Why take transit when I can drive anywhere in the GTA in half the time. Except for when there's an accident on the 401, which is a daily occurrence. Building highway 413 won't reduce congestion, just another east-west corridor to be poorly planned and implemented, which will have just as many accidents as the 401 or Gardiner\n"

        "comment": "We must keep existing bike lanes and continue to build more dedicated bike lanes along major transit corridors in Toronto.\nDedicated lanes keeps cyclists same from being hit by other vehicles and keeps them off the sidewalk so they don't run in to pedestrians.\nMany people down town Toronto also don't own cars, relying on transit or bikes (self owned or public) to make trips around town. This encourages community building and enables people to shop locally! Many small businesses benefit from local foot traffic over shoppers who have to drive to a destination.\nBike lanes allow more people to feel safe when biking around town, which will reduce the likelihood of them driving in a car. This reduces the number of cars on the road and is what will really reduce traffic and gridlock in the city.\nAlso cannot scrap the environmental assessments to speed up the building of highways. Our greenbelt is sensitive to changes and won't recover once disturbed by construction and infrastructure.\nPreserving the environment becomes more important as climate change impacts annual snow and rain fall. We need to maintain our green spaces to prevent floods and maintain habitats for the native species.\n"

        "comment": "This framework is incredibly disrespectful to all cyclists in the province. The majority of cycling infrastructure is put in place in response to a cyclist fatality or injury. Infrastructure that protects cyclists is not a waste of space. Additionally, this proposal is significant jurisdictional overreach that would not be tolerated by other levels of government. Only cities and municipalities can make the best decisions for their jurisdiction, not a province imposing more red tape.\n"

It ignores countless examples in Canada and worldwide of the positive impact of bike infrastructure on community safety, livability, and reducing congestion of motor vehicles. Removing or delaying improvements to road safety will undoubtedly lead to injury and death. And induced demand leading to a hasty rebound of congestion will ensure failure of this policy's stated goals. Shame on the government for wasting our time and tax dollars on this harmful proposal.\n"

        "comment": "Require bike lanes with every road repaving. More people on bikes logically mean less people travelling by car. More safe bike lanes means more people opting to utilize bikes instead of cars. If a bike lane requires the removal of a car lane, ensure it is a great bike lane that will be utilized well.\nThat internet picture of the same number of people in cars, buses and on bikes is an incredibly useful visualization.\nAdditionally high speed rail options and other accessible means of public transportation would greatly reduce gridlock and car use.\nAs a rural resident and voter, it is untenable and nearly impossible to safely and timely travel to or within the city. If viable transit options existed I, one person in a large vehicle with multiple empty seats, taking up excessive space and causing traffic, would happily chose transit options.. If safe bike lanes and pedestrian transportation routes existed I could bring a bike for the last parts of my journeys. It does not feel safe to bike in the city. Transit takes to long to get in,out and around the city as it is. We need to be adding pedestrian infrastructure not removing it.\nRip up half of some four lane streets as mass transit routes or pedestrian corridors. Remake the city for people not cars.\nSincerely, a car driver.\n"

If someone is poor or doesn't make a lot of money having less viable options makes them need to take on an expensive car, bike lines reduce congestion, transit reduces congestion.\nThis bill is a reversal of what's needed in our province.\n"

Taking out bike lines would only increase traffic, as it would decrease access to a less traffic-inducing method of commuting (biking, of course).\nWhat is this illogical proposal? Leave our bike lanes alone. People are dying from a lack of bike lanes already and you want to get rid of existing ones???\nIf your traffic commute is so bad, take transit like the rest of us!!! Transit and biking is more affordable, who even has a car in this city!?\n"
