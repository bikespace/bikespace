        "comment": "The bike lanes on the major streets (e.g bloor) have been so paramount to efficient commuting, safety, and overall quality of life. I bike everyday (using the city bikes) for 30 minutes on Bloor and Runnymede to get to work and it has been by far the best way of commuting. The TTC is unreliable and getting more and more unsafe and cars are not a viable option for most people living downtown Toronto. Not to mention my quality of life has immensely improved by utilizing these bike lanes. Compromising the bike lanes to cater to what is already a TOO car-centric city is a shame to the many people that rely on the current bike lane infrastructure for the reasons listed above and many more.\n"

        "comment": "I support bike lanes, and I believe that municipalities are best positioned to make decisions around bike lanes.  We will not reduce gridlock by allocating more space to private vehicles.  We should prioritize our public spaces for use by people, and private vehicles are not an efficient use of that space.\nI do not think this legislation should be the priority of our government.  There are more pressing issues in the province, like health care, which require our government's time and attention.\n"

        "comment": "This decision is so backwards it's embarrassing. There is no benefit to this and it's complete waste of taxpayer money, money that people worked hard to make, and this is just throwing it away.\nThere are already too many vehicles on the roads, but imagine the chaos of all the delivery bikes not having a dedicated lane.  Does anyone honestly think putting those vehicles on the roads is going to improve traffic? Someone at the highest levels of government proposing an idea this shortsighted and counterproductive should be laughed out of the room.  This is not a thoughtful, adult proposal.\nStreets with two lanes already shrink to one because either people are parked or idling with their four way flashers on.  Why penalize cyclists for this? The idea that cyclists are somehow more responsible for traffic than CARS is laughable.\nHow can the idea of tearing up almost brand new structures to make room for more cars thinking this will alleviate traffic be taken seriously.\nMore people will die. This is virtually guaranteed when you cram this many more vehicles into already limited space.  Our government is meant to protect us , not put us in harm's way.\nIf the premier looked you in the face and asked if you thought this was a good idea you'd say it is? You could say that truthfully? You could say ripping up new and well made infrastructure that was paid for once with taxpayer money should be destroyed and once again paid by taxpayer money? How did the people who are supposed to represent us get so corrupt and willing to harm their own citizens?  Willing to waste our money?\nWould you ask 'who is going to benefit from this financially?' Or just ignore that obvious angle?\nI could go on and on, because there are countless reasons why this is a terrible idea, but I would genuinely surprised if anyone is actually reading these and presenting this case to the Premier.\n"

We need to be encouraging people to take the bike lanes. We need less people driving on the roads to make them less congested.\nIn a time when climate change needs to be on forefront of our minds, with this Bill it\u2019s clear that Ford and his ministers have the wrong ideas for our province.\n"

        "comment": "This Bill is deeply concerning for several reasons.\n- Bikes do not cause congestion. Cars do. If we want to reduce gridlock we need to prioritize efficient modes of transit. Namely bikes, local transit, and intercity transit. Providing people with the choice to these modes of transportation will reduce the number of cars on the road, freeing up space for emergency vehicles and those who still wish to (or need to) drive.\n- Bike lanes have proven to be both good for business and result in roads that are safer for everyone.\n- Highways should connect cities together. They should not be used to transport people within a city. Building Highway 413 will destroy large swaths of livable space in the city. It will force people to travel longer distances to their jobs and induce a demand of cars, making congestion worse.\n- The Province should not be dictating how municipalities design and build their roads, especially when the decisions are not backed by data. This red tape is effectively a ban on bike lanes and will do our cities tremendous harm in the years to come.\n"

Municipalities absolutely need control of their infrastructure planning and a solid, forward-looking infrastructure plan includes active transport.\nBike lanes do not cause congestion.

        "comment": "1) REMOVING BICYCLE LANES WILL COST LIVES\nYou must be totally mad. What a waste of taxpayer money for this shambles. How many more cyclists have to be run down and killed by a motorist until you stop your culture war games?\n2) HIGHWAY 413 IS NOT NEEDED - PUBLIC TRANSPORT IS\nI'm originally from London, UK. The public transport system in Ontario is shocking. It is impossible to live here without car, unless in downtown Toronto - which you seem hellbent on screwing up. It's common sense congestion is caused by cars. Simply redirecting cars won't reduce congestion, unless you want to nothing but roads covering the landscape. Ontario needs to invest more in trains, subways, and streetcars (trams).\nHardly any local authority wants this highway to nowhere. Use the money to invest in sustainable public transport. You can achieve similar goals by opening up Highway 407 more for a fraction of the financial and environmental cost - and don't exempt yourselves from proper environmental scrutiny either.\n3) STOP USING POLITICAL SLOGANS TO NAME BILLS / ACTS\nThe ruling Ontario Conservatives pride Canada's links to British traditions. One of them is presumably the Westminster parliamentary system. The Westminster convention is that the names of Bills and Acts are supposed to be factual and politically neutral.\n"

        "comment": "This legislation is completely unnecessary. Control over roads and bike lines should remain with the municipalities as they are the experts on city matters and are most capable of balancing varied interests (drivers, transit users, cyclists, pedestrians\u2026)\nThis legislation is also completely misguided and ill-informed. Large cities all over the world are promoting and supporting non-car transportation as this is what best helps with congestion. Bike lanes in Toronto are extremely well used and the removal of bike lanes will take us backward by forcing more bikes into roadways, increasing risk of conflict and injury, and further impeding traffic.\nThis legislation is designed with only one Ontarian in mind - the driver - which is not at all surprising with this government.\n"

The he proposed bike lanes on Keele will make things so much work.  The cyclist are NOT going to work.

If the bike lane is removed, i will continue to bike on Bloor, due to convenience. I will protect myself and ensure that cars are not able to unsafely pass by me. By forcing bikes into traffic you are causing them to be less safe, and ensuring cars are forced to travel at the speed I deem safe. This will add to congestion in the neighborhood, deincentivize shopping on bloor, and increase noise levels. What it will not do is speed up traffic, or stop me and the people I know from biking on Bloor.\n"

Roads are not reserved just for cars. Residents choose the best mode of travel - using their car, a bike, transit or walking.\nI pay taxes to my government to keep people safe on the road - whether they are in cars, on bikes or on foot.\nMessaging about and prioritizing cars, including this new bill, is contributing to a culture that allows drivers to be irresponsible on the roads. There are too many deaths of pedestrians and cyclists by cars. Be better.\nCongestion on the roads is not caused by cyclists. Studies have confirmed it. You know it. Give people better alternatives to relieve congestion. That includes safer bike paths on the main roads.\nI don't ride a bike, but I really appreciate the people who do! Give them better infrastructure. Don't treat them like second hand citizens. Their lives depend on it. Be better.\nThank you.\n"
