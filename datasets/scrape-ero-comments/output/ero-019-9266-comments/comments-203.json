I commute to work by bicycle daily and the thought of reducing cyclists\u2019 ability to navigate the city while spending taxpayer dollars to convert bike lanes back to driving lanes is ridiculous. As toronto continues to get more dense, TTC has become exceedingly slow and cycling is a fantastic option that we need to be encouraging more.\n"

Further, biking has numerous health and environmental benefits. Reducing bike lanes does not stop bikes from being used; it just increases cyclists' risk of death. There are repeated studies that demonstrate that these changes will not fufil the project's goal of reducing gridlock.\n2. Highway 413 is already an unecessary project when the province should be investing in better public transit between cities, with effective first/last-mile connections. This is how evidence suggests you actually reduce gridlock, not by building more roads.\n"

        "comment": "Please listen to the data: safe bike infra protects lives, improves health and environment, promotes local business and DOES NOT cause traffic congestion. On the contrary, more lanes induce more cars/driving and causes more congestions (it's a never-ending vicious cycle) as seen in many other countries. I and my family use bikes lanes to commute and for recreation and more people would if there was safe bike infra. The province's rhetoric against bikes is creating a culture war that's making drivers aggressive towards cyclists, further creating unsafe roads, driving cyclists away from riding on roads and seeming to show that there is not latent/induced demand for cycling - ergo, another vicious cycle.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is an absolute waste of time, a smokescreen for things that actually matter, and does not do what it's supposed to do!\nRemoving bike lanes does not save time or reduce gridlock, nor does it protect cyclists. In fact, taking away bike lanes has been shown to increase traffic congestion. When there\u2019s no dedicated space for cyclists, they end up sharing lanes with vehicles, which slows down everyone on the road due to the varied speeds of cars and bikes. Studies also indicate that bike lanes streamline traffic flow, as cars don\u2019t need to make frequent stops or lane changes to avoid cyclists.\nMoreover, removing bike lanes makes streets more dangerous. Bike lanes provide a critical buffer that reduces the risk of accidents by giving cyclists a designated, safer area away from cars. Without bike lanes, cyclists face a higher risk of being injured or killed in collisions, which not only endangers lives but can lead to more disruptions due to accident investigations and emergency responses.\nIn essence, keeping bike lanes is a practical measure that contributes to smoother traffic flow, fewer accidents, and a safer, more efficient system for all road users. For the love of God, have some sense dear Ford government, and stop this before you all face further embarrassment.\n"

        "comment": "By legislating the construction of bike infrastructure by municipalities and limiting the ability of cities to expand Ontario's bike networks, this bill will have the opposite effect that is intended. This bill will not \"reduce gridlock and save people time\" as claimed, and will in fact continue to make traffic worse and result in longer commutes for everyone.\nEvidence from major cities around the globe all suggests the same things: by increasing funding and construction for higher efficiency modes of transportation, such as public transit and cycling/pedestrian infrastructure, wait times across all modes are reduced, regardless of which ones people take, because the efficiency across all systems is increased.\nTokyo, a city with more than 5x the population of Toronto, does not experience congestion even close to the level Toronto does, because it's a city where one can commute by train with a high degree of reliability.\nParis, a city with a population on par with Toronto, saw traffic improve drastically when it added hundreds of kilometers of bike lanes in the lead up to the Olympics, which also resulted in shorter wait times for police and ambulatory services (see attached link).\nEven those who do not personally use bike lanes or public transit will see an improvement in their car commute as long as other people do use them, because those are more cars off the road and less traffic. This province's insistence on only promoting and building around motor vehicles only is what's causing the congestion problems, as people needing a car for every trip they make results in more cars on the road, which results in more traffic.\nThis bill is not based in reality, and it is more interested in blaming efficient forms of transportation for the downsides of less efficient forms, namely motor vehicles. It will not solve the problem of congestion, and at best will make congestion worse. At worst, it will put people's lives at risk by pushing cyclists into motor vehicle lanes - which I imagine again, will not make motorists happy either.\n"

Every single study suggests that it is beneficial for businesses to have more cycle and pedestrian access. Our province has a lot of problems that needs immediate attention and we need a lot of funds for that. It is a betrayal to the people of Ontario to spend this much time and money on such a non issue like this one,  on top of shady contracts for the Science centre, the Ontario Place and the greenbelt  makes you think the province does not care about the public and has its own interests dictated by only a handful people that whisper things to the premiers ear... If you have such surplus of money, raise nurse salaries and fund more hospitals. Make education more accessible and stop ravaging the city.\n"

Right now, spending months and taxpayer dollars ripping out bike lanes needs more information to justify. This is also a municipal issue, not a provincial one, and should not be determined by Ford.\nIt\u2019s unfortunate that Ford is going waste time and resources to pull out critical biking infrastructure, that ensures safety among cyclists, without doing the homework to know it will \u201cfix\u201d congestion. One might have to ask themselves are the bikes going to disappear if the lanes aren\u2019t there? Probably not. In fact, they will stay on Bloor, Yonge and University. It might even make things slower for drivers.. but we simply don\u2019t have the information to make this call yet.\n"

The province is creating more red tape by requiring municipalities to go to them for approval on bike lanes.\nThe government should be focused on more sustainable methods of transportation for our growing province than car travel.

Highway 413 is a waste of money that will not alleviate gridlock as much as it will encourage more travel by automobile and create gridlock in different places.\n"

        "comment": "If you think that getting rid of bike lanes will reduce traffic then you've been reading the wrong reports. They've actually been proven to increase traffic because there will be more drivers on the road.\nIf you want to decrease traffic, why don't you start with actually completing some of the work on public transit lines like the Eglington Crosstown or any of the insane amount of construction on the GO train lines. Or regulate automobile manufacturers so that car sizes decrease so they take up less space on the roads. If you think riding Toronto/Ontario of bike lanes will protect pedestrians then you're wrong as well. The increase in car sizes and increase of cars on roads will only lead to an increase in pedestrian deaths.\nI am demanding a reconsideration to removing bike lanes as well as ceasing the 413 being built. Getting rid of greenbelt is exactly why there is constant flooding in Toronto during the summers. To continue getting rid of those protected lands will only lead to more flooding and other ecological disasters that will make Toronto and Ontario less habitable.\nThere are many ways that you can prioritize and protect the people of Ontario, neither of which are paving the greenbelt or riding Toronto of bike lanes. I urge the province to reconsider and find evidence-based solutions to the province's issues, like how the more readily available healthcare allows preventable diseases to be caught before they are expensive for the Province/tax payer.\n"

        "comment": "Removal of bike lanes that were just built is nonsensical. Removal of permanent concrete lanes is especially bizarre. This will cause more congestion on major roads. Tearing out bike lanes and putting more expensive construction on major roads is just not in the best interest of Toronto.  Layers of transportation are essential to a functional traffic grid in major cities. It infuriates me as a young adult that time and money is being invested in frivolous projects like this when Ontarians need affordable housing, decent employment opportunities and renters rights.\n"
