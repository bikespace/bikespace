        "comment": "I believe this bill is a massive overreach of provincial jurisdiction. Doug Ford and the provincial government should be far more concerned about building housing (don\u2019t think that we didn\u2019t see that the provincial government missed its target of 1.5M homes built), fixing the healthcare system instead of crippling it, and on actually improving infrastructure for rural and northern communities. Instead of antagonizing a city that desperately needs actual evidence based ways to improve congestion \u2014 which time and time again research has shown is improving bicycle infrastructure and more robust public transit options.\nBike lanes are not only better for traffic by providing people with alternate modes of transportation, they also take cyclists out of dangerous situations. This will just put more people in harms way. We cannot have a thriving, vibrant city if we do not move away from being so car centric.\nFinally, the most confounding part of this legislation is that the conservative government is proposing using additional taxpayer dollars to remove infrastructure that we have already paid for to put in. University Ave\u2019s bike lanes were literally just completed and now we are talking about taking them out? That is such a massive waste of taxpayer money and it is setting us back as a city. As a taxpayer living in Toronto, I am incredibly upset by this. We cannot have local infrastructure and city planning policies interfered by MPs who don\u2019t even live within the city.\n"

Build clinics and hospitals, hire doctors, nurses, and PSWs.  Legislate that medical schools in Ontario should graduate more doctors each year.   Provide assistance to immigrant doctors to help them get licensed to work in Ontario.\nThe Auditor General has identified that the government is sitting on $22 billion of taxes that the government collected (i.e. money from me and you) and has not spent.  Do not waste that money on a highway that will only benefit the already wealthy developers who are clearly friends of the government.   Spend it on what the majority of Ontarians want:  improved PUBLIC healthcare for all.\n"

This law goes against traffic engineering literature of the last 30 years, as it\u2019s been proved time and time again that bike lanes improve traffic and business flow. This is a pathetic populist measure for people who don\u2019t even live in Toronto. A waste of money, a step back in time and putting in danger hundreds of thousands of lives.\n"

        "comment": "This bill will ultimately cost Ontario taxpayers millions of dollars to pass and enact \u2013 on top of the cost already sunk over decades to study, propose and implement them. It will kill Ontarians in collisions with drivers. Their blood will be on your hands. It will increase pollution. It will make Toronto a less liveable city. It will make Toronto a lesser place to play or do business in. It will hurt everyone who either refuses to drive, doesn\u2019t want to drive or cannot afford to drive. It will put thousands of low wage new Canadians at risk delivering our food.\nThere is one thing this bill will NOT do: it will not reduce gridlock for commuters. It will take years to remove these lanes and even when complete it will not change the basic fact: CARS CAUSE TRAFFIC. The only way to ease traffic is to get people PUT of their giant personal vehicles and onto alternate forms of mass transit. This isn\u2019t rocket science.  Do better. I\u2019m disgusted.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal is regressive to important priorities for Ontarians, like affordability, health, and climate. I will briefly address some concerns I have below, as an expert in this field.\n1. As the affordability crisis worsens, many people are unable to afford cars. Biking is an accessible and affordable method of transit. By removing bike lanes, the government is demonstrating that they prioritize the needs of car owners over those who ride bikes, who are largely young populations and new Canadians. These groups are already most at risk as a result of the affordability crisis.\n2. Air level pollutants from cars are a major public health concern, so doubling down on car based infrastructure commits Ontario to poor air quality around roads that threatens our most vulnerable like children and the elderly.\n3. SImilar to my above comment, Canada is currently experiencing public health crises related to non-communicable diseases. One of the greatest predictors of these diseases is having a sedentary lifestyle. Removal of bike infrastructure and blocking new infrastructure will worsen these health crises by restricting physical activity for those living in urban centres and in car dependant regions.\n4. We are experiencing a climate crisis. We need to build livable cities that are climate-ready and low carbon. This is an obvious step backwards for climate mitigation and adaptation.\nRemoval of existing bike lanes and blocking future infrastructure is completely unacceptable from a health, affordability, and climate perspective. Why are you wasting taxpayer dollars on this?\n"

        "comment": "I strongly and vigorously object to the proposal of requiring new bike lanes to have provincial approval.\nFirstly, this is an exercise in undemocratic and authoritarian overreach. The regulation of roads in cities should be a municipal responsibility, not a provincial one. I pay for Toronto's roads with my municipal taxes. It should be up to those living in a given city to make these decisions. I do not drive a car. I do ride a bike. I do pay (considerable) property and income taxes. I pay for the roads. Why should I be a second-class citizen in my own city?\nSecondly, removing bike lanes will result in more deaths and less safe roads. If you say we should move bike lanes on through roads like Yonge, Bloor, and University to side roads, you have probably never tried to bike in the city. In many cases, secondary roads are not direct - one must make frequent detours onto other streets. They also cross busy roads with no signals, presenting a safety problem.\nFinally, there is absolutely NO evidence that bike lanes slow down car traffic. This \"common sense\" is nonsense. Indeed, most studies seem to indicate the contrary.\nI am deeply sorry that Doug Ford does not like bike roads on Bloor St, but that does not give him the right to exercise dictatorial powers over the citizens of Toronto.\n"
