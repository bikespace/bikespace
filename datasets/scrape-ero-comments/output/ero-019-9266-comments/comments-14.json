        "comment": "Municipalities should remain responsible for making their own decisions in their cities/towns based on the needs of their constituents. There are too many cars on the road, especially in Toronto. Bike lanes provide a safe way to get to around without having to drive and should be encouraged. Taking away bike lanes will mean even more congestion. Bikes will then have to share the road impacting traffic further or there will be more cars on the road if those people no longer feel safe biking to get to work etc. Studies have shown that bike lanes reduce traffic congestion. It's evident in many other cities around the world. What would actually reduce congestion is to provide further options for people to get around, such as by train. Southern Ontario needs more transit options and has for years. Many people would be happy to take the train vs sitting in traffic. Perhaps government efforts could be focused on moving along those projects instead of wasting money to remove and limit bike lanes.\n"

        "comment": "After the Bloor bike lanes were installed I started using bikeshare to ride downtown for Blue Jays games and to go to restaurants etc. I would not be willing to ride without separated bike lanes so if you remove them I will have to stop riding which is a real shame. The city is a better place with more and better options to get around than just driving.\nI also sometimes have to drive my car along Bloor west of Runnymede in the evening and the bike lanes have made the drive better. This is because before, when there were two lanes of traffic in each direction, at every intersection either the left or right lane could be blocked by someone trying to turn off Bloor. You had to constantly predict which lane would be free flowing and merge back and forth. Now there is always one free flowing lane since the turns generally have their own lanes.\nI oppose this bill and would like the premier to let cities decide these issues for themselves.\n"

        "comment": "This legislation seems to be routed in anger and misinformation, and is also discriminatory (the very text of the legislation is only focused on drivers - why is there no focus on public transportation (i.e. trains, busses, etc.), or active transportation (walking, cycling)?)\nThere seems to be no reference to facts or studies - see this recent article from CBC (https://www.cbc.ca/news/science/bike-lanes-impacts-1.7358319)\nThere have been myriad studies showing that adding lanes of a highway does not help congestion.  Increasing lanes on highways will only increase congestion and pollution.\nBut given that the facts have been completely ignored in this discussion, I'll share my own experience regarding the Bloor West bike lanes.  My office is moving from downtown to Mississauga in the near future. With the Bloor West bike lanes, I have a viable route (i.e. mostly via bike lanes) to get from my downtown home to the office in Mississauga.  Without the Bloor West bike lanes, my commute will be 9km longer as it would involve a significant detour to ensure a safe route. If that happens, I won't bike.  I'll drive.  I'll be another person contributing to the traffic, gridlock, congestion, that you so dearly want to reduce.\nI can't believe that legislation that is so regressive is even being tabled. There is no path forward where promoting car travel over mass or active transit makes any logical sense at all. This is appealing only to voters' justifiable frustration with travel times, but in a way that will only make it worse in the long run.  The government should be doing everything possible to encourage people to find other ways to move around the city and province rather than catering to the vocal, selfish, entitled minority who feel it's their right to drive themselves around a dense city with no regard for anyone else trying to get around.\n"

The closest example of the success of bike lane is Montreal which has similar cultural and climate background as Toronto and most others Ontarian municipalities.\nOn top of that, increasing highway speed limit and others measures to encourage driving is going against the province environmental commitment.\nThank you for taking in account my comments.\n"

A painted line on pavement is not protection.\n4. Parked cars take up more space than bike lanes and serve less purpose on the thoroughfare - remove THEM, not bike lanes.\n5. Saving 2-3 minutes of a driver's commute is not worth ONE life.\nFinally, my tax dollars should be spent on healthcare, on education, and on care of our environment - NOT obstructing cities' decisions for their roads!\n"

I feel safer and more secure on the road with the bike lanes in place. It seems like a huge waste of time and money to take away something we've spent years building. Why not spend that money on something valuable, like ending hallway healthcare? And can the government answer why my physical safety should be less important than a few minutes of car drivers' time?\nIf the government is so worried about space on the roads I suggest removing on-street parking on major arterial roads.\n"

Please look at the scientific data which consistently demonstrates that travelling by bike results in less traffic congestion, safer commutes for cyclists and reduced green house gas emissions. Anecdotal data from irate drivers who live in Etobicoke should not be the basis for any proposed legislation.  The current framework for bike lanes legislation is simply an uninformed and reactive approach to a very complex situation. Please consult with the experts in transportation and environmental sciences to develop measured and proactive legislation.\nThank you very much.\n"

What a waste of time and money!\nMy family and I drive, cycle, walk, and take public transit to get around our city. We travel to work, school, and local businesses via cycling. Our safe bike lanes are extremely important to us as both drivers and cyclists. Designated bike lanes on all roads (both side streets and main roads) are extremely important, they keep our family and community safe. Bike lanes are also the key to efficient driving, there is absolutely zero evidence to indicate that eliminating bike lanes improves traffic for drivers.\nJust this summer a woman was killed on Bloor street because a driver chose not to respect the bike lane infrastructure. Why is Doug Ford wasting his time putting our lives at risk? Is it so that he can feel better about his commute to work? Outrageous.\nDoug Ford, do you job! Fix our failing healthcare system. Fix the affordability crisis for folks who cannot afford food at our grocery stores! Invest in our under-resourced schools! Do better.\n"

And I fundamentally disagree with this legislation.\nIn fact, I have never submitted a comment on proposed legislation before, attended a rally or campaign for any issue, yet am so disappointed with this proposed legislation that I am doing all of the above.\nAs a driver, I know that this proposed legislation will on average actually make congestion worse and my drive times LONGER, both today and in the future.\nStudies have shown this again and again around the world. And it makes sense - in fact, I am a prime example of why: without plentiful, connected, protected bike infrastructure I will not choose to bike somewhere, even if it's relatively close. Instead I will get in my car and drive, adding to the congestion.\nI want everyone to be able to get from Point A to Point B as fast as reasonably possible, today and in the future. And I know that congestion is only going to get worse and worse as the city and surrounding areas continue to add more people. There is no escaping that fact. So the only real, viable solution to this, both in the short-term and long-term, is to incentivize alternative methods of transportation like bike lanes.\n"

The drive was 15 minutes\nThen I found a way to get out of my car to ride my bike to work.  The ride was 20 minutes.  Neither traffic congestion nor weather affected my ride.\nWhen I got back into my car, three years later, that 15 minute drive had turned into 29 minutes.  No bike lanes existed.\nThere are lots of other drivers just like me would would like to get out of their cars. And because of bike lanes, they did.  But removing bike lanes will simply return thfm back into drivers turning safe streets into the DVP, Gardiner and the 401.\n"

        "comment": "There is no data that supports the assertion that bicycle lanes which remove a lane of vehicular traffic are increasing congestion on roads in the cities and towns of the Province. Congestion is increasing because the population is increasing and geometrically, there is no more room for additional automobile traffic on our roads. Bicycles are a carbon-neutral means of transportation which also encourage active lifestyles. In order for bicycling to be a viable means of transportation, lane infrastructure needs to be created and connected in a network fashion, just as with roads for automobile traffic.\nAt a recent public hearing on the Bloor St. W. bike lanes in Toronto, the deputy fire chief indicated that on sections of the road where lanes had been installed, response times for his emergency vehicles improved. This is likely because a 2nd or curb lane for vehicular traffic which is occasionally blocked by a parked car requires all road users to manage drivers merging back into the single unobstructed lane, which is a time-consuming and inefficient process. With one one lane for vehicles, there is no lane-changing, and no subsequent time cost associated therewith.\nInfrastructure projects which expand the number and size of roads for vehicular traffic have consistently failed to 'reduce congestion' for a century or more. The concept of 'induced demand' is a real one, with clear precedent in observable reality. Tearing up bike infrastructure and blocking the development of additional lanes will do nothing to make driving around Toronto faster or easier, and will certainly lead to some avoidable deaths.\n"

        "comment": "I would like to voice my disappointment with the proposed Bill 212. It is a blatant example of confirmation bias (that bike lanes cause traffic), and disagrees with all research on root cause & solutions for congestion in cities.\nIt is widely accepted within the transportation engineering community that addition of lanes designed for cars does not decrease traffic congestion, but rather increases congestion in the long term as more people elect to drive as their primary option.\nReducing opportunities for an improved cycling network with our cities is a short-sited approach that may negligibly decrease car traffic for a year or two, before making it much worse. Conversely, improving the cycling network has potential to decrease congestion as more people elect to cycle as a primary mode of transportation.\nMajor streets that are congested see high traffic volumes because they are the most efficient route for drivers. This is no different for cyclists. Cycling as an alternative to driving needs to be efficient to be viable. By eliminating cycle lanes on major streets the province is making cycling a less attractive option - and will subsequently promote driving, more congestion.\nI hope that the province considers the overwhelming scientific evidence, the climate, and the safety of its people, before enacting a bill that is not supported by fact.\n"

It is safer and environmentally better for both driver and cyclist to continue bike lane use.\nMy 50 year driving experience has shown that since the institution of bike lanes, traffic has improved.  Gridlock is not caused by bike lanes.  It is caused by construction, drivers not following rules of the road and blockage of the \u201cbox\u201d.\nIt is hard to maintain the one meter law from cyclists, where the lanes do not exist, thus slowing down traffic.\nIt would be a fiscal and environmental error to remove bike lanes, especially on major arteries.\n"

To imagine the province stepping in to over-rule municipal decisions on commuter / cycling safety is frustrating. I both drive a car and cycle in downtown Toronto and while bicycle lanes can be a bit of a nuisance when it comes to finding parking or rush-hour congestion, it has encouraged me to cycle places more and more when the weather permits, taking one more car off the road that would otherwise be adding to the congestion. I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not alone in the group of people who choose to ride their bikes as a preferred mode of transport.\n I ride my bike to work daily on a very predictable commute time, with segregated bike lanes available the whole way. Even with this, drivers can be negligent of cyclist safety and I have regular close calls.\nRemoving bike lanes would be a step backward for a dense city that thrives on providing safe options to cyclists.\n"

All aboard the Doug Ford gravy train I guess\nAs someone who grew up in a rural area I'm disgusted at how much attention you give to one city when there is an entire province you're supposed to be serving.
