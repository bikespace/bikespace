        "comment": "I am against this proposal. I regularly use bike lanes in Toronto and consider them essential transportation infrastructure. I feel that reducing bike infrastructure will make transportation more dangerous for many people.\nToronto is getting more densely populated and people are struggling with the cost of living. This means we need more alternative, and cheaper modes of transport, instead of prioritizing car infrastructure.\n"

        "comment": "I do not support Bill 212, including expediting Highway 413 and its exemption from the environmental assessment. There should be full and frank discussion of the entirety of this act and its implications.\nI also do not support the province's stick handling bike lanes. Bike lanes reduce congestion in the downtown core and are proven to be measurably beneficial to small businesses and the economy. Moreover, protected bike lanes are essential for the safety of both cyclists and drivers.\nRemoval of bike lanes on Yonge, Bloor, and University Avenue is a waste of government time, money, and has unnecessary environmental impact. So much money and energy have already gone into these lane changes. Furthermore, by removing \"sections\" and again creating changing traffic patterns, you are putting cyclists and drivers at risk.\nRemoving bike lanes will not improve congestion. Highway 401 is a testament to, what seems to be, Ontario's motto \"one more lane will make it better\". One more lane will not change the congestion for the better, if anything it will make it worse. Those who would be cycling will then be in ubers, taxis, and cars. By removing bike lanes, you are putting more cars on the road.\nAlso, this bill is an egregious example of government overreach. If Ford wants to run Toronto traffic so badly, run for city council. I don't want my provincial government wasting time reviewing city planning, that already is going through its own review hoops. My provincial government should be investing in health care, education, and inter-jurisdictional transportation (not inner city transportation). Tell your pals at Metrolinx to open the new lines and don't pave over line 3, upgrade it to light rail. Get more rail out to suburbia and get more park and rides going. Invest in our future, not our cars.\nI am incredibly frustrated and dissatisfied and embarrassed by Ford's obsession with bike lanes. This does not serve residents of the GTA and it does not serve the rest of the entirety of the province. Imagine living in Ignace Ontario and having your government spend so much time, money, and breath on a personal vendetta of the premier against a city that doesn't love him. What a waste.\n"

        "comment": "As a physician, commuter, cyclist, and driver, I strongly oppose the removal of the bike lanes on Bloor, University, and Yonge. I use the bike lane on Bloor and University every single day to commute to and from work. I own a car and drive it when needed, but it is simply impractical to expect millions of people in a dense inner city to get around in large vehicles. There has always been traffic downtown. Often, when comparing modes of transport, cycling is faster than driving or transit. What I witness with my own eyes is that bike lanes are popular and well utilized. Empowering people to use their own bodies and exercise is critical to a healthy population. Fiscally, it's absurd to remove infrastructure that was just completed. This is a horrendous, destructive, and irresponsible attack of the provincial government on the city of Toronto.\n"

        "comment": "I am against Bill 212, as it takes a short-sighted approach to transportation by prioritizing cars at the expense of sustainable, active transportation options like bike lanes. I am a frequent cyclist, and as someone expecting a child, I want to raise them in a community that prioritizes safety, health, and the environment. This bill risks taking us backward by limiting access to bike lanes and reinforcing car dependency, which has already shown negative impacts on traffic, air quality, and overall livability. Bike lanes reduce gridlock by giving people safer options to commute without cars, helping reduce pollution and congestion.\nBy making bike lanes a politically divisive issue, Bill 212 ignores their proven benefits: fewer cars on the road, safer streets, and a healthier environment for all of us. Let's focus on building a balanced and forward-thinking transportation system that prioritizes people over cars and ensures a sustainable future for our kids.\n"

        "comment": "As a Canadian citizen and permanent resident of Ontario, proper bike infrastructure is absolutely essential to my and many others in my community. Bikes are used by many as a main method of transportation as they are affordable, fast, good for health, and safe. The affordable part is key as many working people and students do not have the resources to use cars. Providing safe and convenient bike routes benefits a wide variety of people in a community; from families to students, to regular working people. As local governments are the most closely related to their communities, they should be the ones to assess and update their regions transportation in a way that benefits their community. Moving part this to the provincial level and taking away autonomy from these local branches of government is a huge miss-step and I strongly encourage the provincial government to reconsider their overreach.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is profoundly short-sighted and counterproductive.\nThere is no solution to traffic congestion except providing viable alternatives to driving. You are going to do the exact opposite; taking away alternatives, and pretend that this will help matters.\nI am both a car driver and a cyclist, and I hate bicycles and cars sharing space, from both sides. I hate the feeling of being stuck behind a bicycle in my car, and I hate being in danger for my life when cycling near cars. This situation benefits no one.\nAnd expecting cyclists to just \"bike on side streets instead\" makes no sense. People cycle on main streets for the same reasons they drive on main streets: 1. main streets are designed as direct thoroughfares, and 2. there are shops, restaurants, businesses, etc. on main streets that they want to go to.\nThe best way to reduce car traffic is to make it easier to get around without using a car. You know this. The fewer other cars there are on the road, the more pleasant it is to drive. So, don't go limiting the construction of something that is actually going to help out of short-sighted selfishness.\n"

        "comment": "Most car trips are under 2 km. When safe bike lanes are available, people will bike those short distances, removing up to 20% of cars from roads - reducing congestion - especially in downtown areas. Multiple studies show a net economic benefit for bike lanes - increases in sales to local businesses, reduced congestion, reduced healthcare costs, healthier and happier people at work and school.\nMost bike lanes on busy streets in urban areas replace street parking. Removing parking activity, by pushing parking to side streets or parking lots, also reduces delays and congestion, allowing traffic to flow without interruptions. Bike lanes on busy streets improve traffic flow.\nThere is fixed road space downtown. Adding lanes in one area does not add lanes further away. Thus, any perceived \"reduction in congestion\" or \"speeding up of traffic\" in one small area just means worse congestion and standstills a few blocks further away. More cars means more cars, means worse traffic. You have to look at the entire system.\nRemoving bike lanes will KILL PEOPLE.\nThere is no economic, traffic, or moral reason to remove bike lanes or prevent new ones from being built. This is like removing the EV car chargers. An action that will simply be undone, at great expense, within a couple of years.\nBe more like the great world cities - support alternative transport (walking, cycling, public transit).\nPlease, stop making Ontario a laughingstock. Destroying a world heritage park (Ontario Place) and closing the first science museum (Ontario Science Centre) has put Ontario sufficiently on the map of worst-run jurisdictions. End your term quietly. Fund healthcare, schools, school buses, housing. Do at least one thing that redeems your political career.\n"

Driving in urban area is already distracting enough and drivers do not need additional worries that cyclist are on their lanes. Keep cyclists on dedicated bike lanes and cars on separated traffic lanes. Side street routes are not alternative to dedicated bike lanes, those streets are often not connected, and needed to facilitate local traffics.\nBike lanes are important transport infrastructure for me any many other taxpayers as I commute to work on bike daily. As government, one should ensure safety for all road users, especially those who are vulnerable.\n"

Our cities are growing constantly and you are expecting all these new residents to drive?  This will create... guess what? More traffic. Is Doug getting money from paving companies and car companies on top of from developers? Removing relatively new infrastructure seems like an absolute waste of money. The network is new and incomplete, of course ridership is not at its full capacity yet. If there were no roads would people continue to drive? I'm in Hamilton, our city thankfully didn't have to open up our borders due your reversed policies. We are heavily investing in infill development, bike lanes, and alternative transit options in order to keep us a financially viable city. This policy scares me for the long term health of our cities and their residents.\n"

Is this really the best use of our tax dollars?\nI use bike lanes regularly, but also drive regularly, and I\u2019m sure that other drivers, like me, would rather have cyclists out of the way, in their own bike lanes. Removing bike lanes, or preventing them from being implemented on major traffic axes, does not mean cyclists will not use these major traffic axes and take detours through side streets. Cyclists will take the fastest route, and this might therefore mean that they will choose to use the road, which is simply unsafe for them and for the drivers.\n"

Let\u2019s improve congestion by making everyone drive because transit sucks and cycling will be unsafe that is a brilliant idea almost as smart as building a tunnel for cars underneath the 401.
