I use these bike lanes for commuting to work and if they are removed, I would no longer fell safe biking and would then mean I either work from home and do not support downtown businesses or would drive, meaning there would be more cars driving, more traffic and more congestion.\nThe data shows the bike lanes are not causing additional delays or issues for emergency response. These bike lanes keep everyone safe and additional construction to remove them is not only a waste of public money, our money, but it will also lead to more congestion and delays driving due to unnecessary construction.\nAllow the municipalities to have a say what happens in their cities.\n"

        "comment": "Hello,\nI am a resident in Scarborough. This bill is a big slap in the face to all the residents of Toronto and will cause more congestion in the city. There are ample studies and evidence that bike lanes and alternate modes of transport OTHER than single occupant vehicles. Provincial politics should stay out of municipal issues and focus on spending our tax dollars wisely on completing other major transit projects such as the Eglinton LRT and the Ontario Line.\nOn a more personal note. I cycle to and from the city almost on a daily basis and rely on these bike lanes for my personal safety. MTO has already shut down the ONLY safe crossing of the 401 (Betty Sutherland Trail). Removing bike lanes further will put more people at risk of collisions and fatalities.\nI strongly oppose the removal of any bike lanes and for the provincial government to stop meddling in city affairs. DO YOUR JOB, not our Mayors.\n"

I have a young child who will be riding a bike soon.\nPlease do not remove these key arterial bike lanes. They are integral to my community. They do not cause congestion - they make our City more accessible and more functional by allowing for different modes of transportation.\nThe bikelanes also foster a community atmosphere that is good for our local businesses.\nPlease do not let the larger debate over bikelanes in other parts of the GTA damage our community.\n"

        "comment": "The most disruptive aspect of the bike lanes was their installation. Now that they exist traffic moves and there are lots of bikes using them. Toronto is a much more dynamic city because of them.\nIt is offensive to me that the government is not letting cities decide what is best for themselves. And if the provincial government could focus on completing transit projects and not tearing things up and spending money frivolously that would be appreciated. I am tired of your disregard for my tax dollars and implementation of dumb ideas that no one voted for or asked for. Just stop. And do not remove these lanes. Cyclists deserve these corridors.\n"

        "comment": "I am deeply disappointed that such an anti-business, tax-payer wasting, public safety endangering, and zero fact based policy be presented by this government. Such an misguided government overreach should absolutely not be any part of a party ideology that strives for \"smaller government\", and I am very confused why a small consortium of (equally confused and misguided) Etobicoke residents get to dictate \"facts\" to the rest of Toronto - a single city within Ontario that seems to get far more attention the rest of province by this government.\nBike lanes save lives, decrease the reliance of cars (thus improving traffic), support local businesses, and decrease first responded times.\nI am pleading for this party to achieve a meager amount of clarity of their duty and create policies that actually make all of Ontario better. Creating such proposed policies have the singular goal of amplifying your populist base while ignoring the truth of countless studies, hundreds of other cities, and the actual professionals.\nThis proposed policy's goal seems to be only to secure your reelection without actually listening to any of the facts being presented by professionals, and for that you should be embarrassed and deeply ashamed.\n"

        "comment": "I fully support the removal of bike lanes throughout the city. I grew up in Toronto and remember my parents who immigrated here driving down Bloor street to get groceries from the store further away from us because it was cheaper. 20 years later, driving down Bloor street is nearly impossible because the parking and bike lanes reduce a major street down to one lane. My parents don't live in the city anymore and rely on a car to get into the city. They cannot feasibly walk or bike here. However, traffic has gotten so bad in Toronto that driving here is a big ordeal as well.\nI personally love biking recreationally, and would want to keep bikers safe. However, given the weather here, it's only reasonable to bike for less than half the year and I can't bike in most cases (I can't carry my groceries with a bike, I can't bike to my office as I can't shower there). It's not a practical mode of transportation in 90% of cases.\nI do take the TTC very often and I feel that the terrible traffic in the city negatively affects the effectiveness of the TTC as well. Busses are often stuck behind the cars. Around rush hour it's nearly impossible to travel, even by bus.\n"

So many people use them! Why are you wasting money to do this? Why are you hellbent on killing cyclists? Why do you want to make cities MORE congested? Why are you not referencing any research/data to make critical decisions? Why do you not care that your ruining the environment? Why are you giving Ontarians less transportation options? So many questions, because this legislation makes NO logical sense. It benefits NO ONE.\nChange your plans. Do NOT approve this legislation or its amendments.\n"

Cars are BY FAR the least efficient way to move people. Also make our world uglier, louder and less human.\n"

It takes about one minute to send and then one more to encourage a friend to do it too!\nSubject: Opposing Bill 212 - Protect Our Cyclists\nI strongly oppose the proposal for Bill 212 (ERO number 019-9266).\nBike lanes saves lives. They also are kind to our climate, boost small businesses, and help traffic flow better.\nAs an Ontarian, I support keeping the current bike lanes on Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue - and I strongly urge Premier Ford and his government to continue to let the city of Toronto keep their authority in determining the approval process for bike lanes.\nWe need more bike lanes - not less. What we need less of are this government\u2019s so-called policies: anti-human, anti-environment, anti-evidence, pro-corruption, pro-corporation, pro-lining the \u201cright\u201d people\u2019s pockets.

        "comment": "I can't believe how backwards we are. There is congestion because of the hundreds of thousands of new people moving to the GTA. There is congestion because work places will not allow work from home when they don't need to be. There is congestion because Toronto has been neglected and there are so many poorly planned construction projects that are happening at the same time instead of being planned and staggered. There is congestion because our public transit is inadequate. Bike lanes are the least of those problems. I drive as well, and I prefer to bike within the city. My car is taken off the road 90% of the time because I choose to cycle instead. As a driver, I prefer cyclists being safe in their own lane, rather than being stuck behind them. If you remove the bike lanes and put a new car lane, it will either be used for parking or an Uber spot where they stop illegally. This is not a good solution, there needs to be more options invested in than just cars.\n"

        "comment": "This bike lane removal is a profound waste of the province's time and it demonstrates how far they have lost the plot.\nNot only will removing them not improve traffic, since it simply shifts those users to using cars, but it will cost millions of taxpayers dollars to do so.\nRight now millions of Ontarians are without a doctor, we face shortages of nurses, long wait times for ambulances, and shortages of long-term care facilities. There are a 1000 other issues that are better suited to be handled at the provincial level than the existence of 3 bike lanes.\nThis proposal is a waste of the Ministry of Transportation's staff's time, it is a waste of the minister's time, and it is a profound waste of taxpayers money. Ontarians are struggling and this proposal shows this government doesn't care.\n"

Undoing public infrastructure designed to save lives is a disgusting waste of public funds, and a monstrous policy stance. How anyone could support it and sleep well at night is beyond me.\n"
