Cycling to work saves me 50% of my commute time, especially because of the bike lanes the city has installed.  Removing bike lanes will mean I need to drive or take the TTC, which will increase my commute at least 35 minutes a day.  Please don't move forward with this policy.\n"

Toronto residents should via the ballot box for city council be the ones to determine whether or not the existing infrastructure meets their current and future needs.\nToronto has the potential to a leader in cycling infrastructure in North America with the opportunity to make its population physically fitter and its air healthier. The proposed bill is step backwards for health, safety, environment and the sustainable development of the city.\n"

        "comment": "The provincial government should not be concerning itself with municipal matters.\nBike lanes exist for Toronto residents to move about the city safely with an option other than a car. Removing existing bike lanes to reduce traffic is backward thinking - we should be investing in a variety of transit and commuting options.\nDestroying new infrastructure, throwing away tax payer dollars to shorten the commute of drivers from other municipalities should not be the concern of the provincial government. Removing these lanes will make it less safe for Torontonians to use their streets.\nOther world class cities thrive with a multitude of options for getting around. Toronto is forced to go in reverse by a backward-thinking provincial government. It\u2019s discouraging to see them meddling in municipal issues while disregarding provincial concerns such as the crumbling health care and energy grid.\n"

They didn\u2019t consider the needs of the majority of the population that drives and have caused large amounts of congestion. I hope this bill allows the city to remove or at the very least modifies them to be more fair to drivers.\n"

        "comment": "I am 100% against Bill 212\u2019s plans or intentions for bike lanes described here: https://ero.ontario.ca/notice/019-9266\nI have lived in Toronto since 2008. I moved here from The Netherlands - where biking is the primary form of transportation. It is worth noting I am originally from Calgary - so seeing Canada and whole progress in the right direction is very important to me. Since 2008 experiencing the improvements to cycling infrastructure is something that myself and all of my friends have celebrated. I am in my mid thirties so believe my cohort\u2019s perspective is important - it is made up of the future leaders for our community. Continuing to invest in the bike lane program will encourage more people to use them, and ditch their cars. Aren\u2019t we trying to also do what\u2019s right for the environment?\nFurther to improving bike lanes, because of course it\u2019s not always practical to bike in the winter, our tax dollars should go towards improved TTC and Go Train services. These are the areas we want to see our hard earned tax dollars go towards, enhancing our community infrastructure for the group as a whole - not for individuals who cannot fathom taking public transit and must take their own vehicle.\nTo reduce congestion, consider placing tariffs on sections of the city for drivers. If they need to be in certain zones of the city, they can pay extra for that. This will motivate people who can use public transit instead for inner city communing to leave their cars at home. Again - look to Amsterdam or any major European city as an example. Please continue to push forward - not backwards.\n"

        "comment": "I am a 76 year old, senior female living in a rental unit in downtown Toronto. When the city put in protected bike lanes, I started riding my bicycle again to and from various locations rather than driving my car. It is better for the environment, and I feel safe riding on the streets for the first time in years. I have had friends who have been hit by vehicles or at risk of being killed or seriously injured when forced into traffic. If the province plans to remove these bike lanes at great cost to the taxpayer who has already paid to have them installed I have to say you have lost all common sense. Rather than encouraging more vehicle traffic into the city, polluting the air greatly adding to the climate crisis that we know is here, why not invest the taxpayer\u2019s dollars into more, and reliable public transit for all those individuals driving into the city,  rather than pushing seniors, children and youth into harms way and making them pay for the danger you are putting them in.\n"

Bike lanes are good for business, reduce traffic, and save lives. University Ave is well used by many doctors and nurses who work at hospitals downtown. If you see the bikeshare racks around the hospitals you would see hundreds of bikes parked there each day. Every bike is one less car on the road.\n"

Torontos bike lanes keep me safe from reckless drivers and are a big part of taking cars off roads, improving traffic flow.\nI don\u2019t understand why the province is meddling in municipal affairs and i don\u2019t understand why doug ford thinks this is a good idea. expert after expert says it will make traffic worse and result in increased cyclist deaths. i feel strongly about this\u2026 strong enough to vote against conservative over reach in the next election of i have to.

        "comment": "This proposal, which claims to have as its goal, the reduction of  \u201cgridlock\u201d, is based entirely on anti-cyclist sentiment and absolutely no facts. All studies show how extending bike lanes do not impede traffic, it\u2019s so obviously the number of cars that do. (most of which are single occupant)  And many of those vehicles block lanes of traffic by illegally parking/stopping.\n By all metrics, increased cycling improves the livability of a city. Even BIAs in the affected main corridors have changed their views and see bike lanes as a beneficial infrastructure. As bike lanes have been increasingly installed, more people are using them, with cycling becoming the fastest growing method of commuting. Removing bike lanes will only cause more injuries and deaths, for which the Ford government will be entirely to blame.\nThis catering to suburban interests is outrageous. Better public transportation is the answer, not increasing capacity for cars! This regressive, environmentally destructive attitude will make Toronto an increasingly unsafe, unfriendly, unviable city in which to live, work or visit.\nThe studies I would attach in support of my position are already in your hands and I know others have repeatedly cited them. There\u2019s no point in doing so again if you\u2019re just going to ignore them and create policies based on attitudes and no facts.\nThe province has no business getting involved in Toronto\u2019s affairs. It\u2019s anti-democratic.\n"

        "comment": "The bike lanes that are now proposed to be torn up by wastefully spending all of Ontarians\u2019 tax payer dollars, have seen dramatic increases in cyclists. On many days at rush hour, as many as several hundred cyclists have been counted on the bike lanes, adding up to several thousand in a day. These numbers are increases over what they were prior to bike lane installation.\nThis means that, while not all but many, of these cyclists will be forced to drive instead of biking if their ability to safely commute in a reasonable time is removed.\nThat\u2019s over a thousand mostly single occupancy cars being added to the busiest roads in Toronto at rush hour, more than the capability of one more lane of traffic can handle when factoring in things like people who still cycle, parking, cars turning and waiting on pedestrians, etc.\nPut bluntly, this plan will make traffic worse.\n"
