        "comment": "As a resident of Toronto, I use the bike lanes on Richmond and Adelaide almost every day. The barriers provide a lot of safety for me. I have biked in the city for almost 30 years and I love the bike lanes. They make a huge difference. I am also a car owner and I appreciate the barrier between cars and bikers. It just makes sense.\nI know many people who have started biking solely because there are bike lanes available.  There are too many people in Toronto for everyone to be driving their own car. One less car on the road benefits all drivers.\nAlso from a cost perspective spending millions building bike lanes, just to spend millions removing bike lanes is completely inefficient and stupid. Bike lanes save lives and benefit drivers, not the reverse.\n"

If these could be better coordinated and advertised it would help.   I find having the bikes in their own lane makes driving even in one lane less risky and easier than having them share a lane with the other traffic.  Please be certain that removing a bike lane is going to be sufficiently beneficial before doing it.\n"

        "comment": "I am extremely against Bill 212. It is a waste of taxpayer money and the proposal to remove bike lanes in order to reduce traffic congestion is flawed. Where will all the people riding their bikes go? They will move onto road with the cars or commute with their vehicles instead, causing more traffic congestion. There will be an increase in traffic accidents, causing further strain on our already strained healthcare system.\nInstead, the province should focus on investing into public transportation, which would be far better served to clear up traffic congestion than removing the bike lanes. Increasing public transportation means such as subway lines and bus routes, while lowering the cost on fares, will increase usage and lead to less congestion. This has been proven in many metropolitan cities and in Toronto itself.\nI implore you to reconsider Bill 212.\n"

        "comment": "So many old entitled boomers with nothing better to do than to whine about bike lanes in their neighbourhood. None of them really have even the basics of an education in the relevant fields like urban planning and traffic engineering, but because they're so whiny, they think everyone else is entitled to their worthless, uneducated opinions, right? Retired, too much time (and money) on their hands, so they want to feel \"useful/beneficial\" in their community before they die? Or they have nothing better to do than to than to think about themselves, and how they can drive to their destination a few seconds faster, right? Anything else, they only pretend to care about because it lines up with their goals. Don't they realize that, at the speed that construction usually goes in this city, they'll probably all be dead by the time the bike lanes stay or not. And they'll be unhappy regardless of what happens.\nThey're going to spend the remaining, finite moments of their life, in deep unhappiness. And for that, they have my deepest pity.\n"

        "comment": "Vibrant world class cities like New York, Montreal, Paris, Barcelona, Bogota, Vienna, Taipei etc., have one prominent thing in common. In each of these cities, cycling infrastructure has been wisely planned and implemented so that cyclists are safe to ride and as a result fewer fossil fuel burning vehicles are on the roads. The obvious benefit to the planet should be something all responsible humans see as necessary at this stage of the climate crisis, but there are less obvious and no less important benefits as well. Neighbourhoods with many lanes of car traffic are more hazardous to pedestrians and they feel like simply places to pass through. Neighbourhoods with bike lanes foster vibrant street culture which has positive economic implications for small businesses. (This is the case on Bloor Street where the premiere is threatening to remove bike lanes.) Large streets with commuter bike lanes create conduits for cyclists to connect with public transit which in turn keeps more cars off the roads lessening congestion. (This is the case on University Ave where the premiere is threatening to remove bike lanes.) The irresponsibility of spending millions to undo the well studied progress that has been made in the city of Toronto is absurd. This would never happen in Paris! This would never be conceivable in New York! Cyclists do not deserve to die because they chose a responsible, ethical, necessary way to move themselves in our city. Removing these lanes will not solve the painfully obvious problem of too many commuters driving cars into the city, congestion on the 401 or QEW or Allen Expressway will not be changed by 3 fewer bike lanes.\n"

Too many personal cars on the roads are the cause. If the province is serious about reducing traffic congestion, it should be investing in better mass public transit\u2014improving existing systems in addition to expanding them (as is being done with the Ontario Line) and supporting municipalities to become more supportive of active transportation.\nThe time and effort currently being placed on controlling bike lanes\u2014which help to save lives\u2014would be much, much better spent devising a strong climate change program for Ontario.\nSincerely,\nA resident of Midtown Toronto, a region growing very rapidly that\u2014for the health and safety of residents \u2014needs fewer cars on the roads, not the means for them to move more quickly.\n"

I am not a regular cyclist but I'm supportive of safe bike lanes because they help move people through the city, and they make the roads and sidewalks safer for everyone. I have a hard time believing that a massive, expensive and disruptive project to rip out the new bike lanes on Bloor will be good for anyone. Drivers, cyclists, pedestrians and the vast majority of local merchants will hate the disruption.\nAlso, it's a highly inappropriate overreach by the provincial government into a municipal issue.\nAlso, it will be terrible for the environment.\nPlease shelve this really poor, short-sighted piece of legislation.\nThank you.\n"

Even though I own a vehicle, I still do a lot of my trips in my area by bicycle. I have even joined Bike Share after having a bike stolen a couple years ago. I beleive the bike lanes encourage biking and make the streets safer for bicycles. I always try to search out the bike lanes when travelling by bicycle. I appreciate the effort the city makes to expand the network of bike lanes and the thought that goes in to their location.\nI do not think that eliminating the bike lanes will improve traffic. I see so many single occupant vehicles on the streets. I think that Bill 212 is a huge overreach by the Provincial government. Even if it's a popular move, it is not the right thing to do. It's a waste of tax payers money and a step. backward. It will put Toronto out of sync with progressive cities around the world.\nI do NOT support this Bill and would like to see it withdrawn.\nThank you\n"

Bloor St is a much needed avenue of travel for all commuters not in cars, and we should be encouraging the use of bike travel.  Lives will be lost by removing these lanes, and this can be prevented by simply leaving things status quo.

        "comment": "This is a very bad idea because it will cause bikers to have to bike among cars, which is way more disruptive to traffic than having a dedicated bike lane. It's also much more dangerous for the bikers, who should be allowed and even encouraged to use their bikes, as that cuts down on greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, removing bike lanes will just increase traffic as crews change the paint, and adding an extra lane on city streets just means people will try to park there. Plus, adding more car lanes doesn't actually reduce traffic because of induced demand.\n"

        "comment": "Thank you for the opportunity to provide this feedback.\nI think we should have more bike lanes throughout Toronto - not fewer. Removing bike lanes to make more space for cars would be a waste of money and  detrimental to the liveability of Toronto. We should be encouraging cycling as well as walking and the use of public transit rather than encouraging more cars.\nI tend to drive my car to get around the city but I would consider cycling if I felt I could do it safely. For the moment there are no bike lanes where I live and  I am not willing to risk cycling in the same lanes as fast moving cars and trucks . I view the gradual expansion of the network of bicycle lanes in Toronto as something to be proud of and something that makes Toronto a better place to live and work even though I am not yet participating as a cyclist.\nBike lanes are obviously critically important for the safety of cyclists- but they make life easier for drivers as well. Driving a car alongside a bike which is in a separate, dedicated bike lane is easy while driving a car and  sharing the lane with cyclists is stressful and dangerous.\nCycling is better for our environment than driving cars; several bicycles can fit in the space of a single car - and considering that many cars on our roads are being driven to transport a single person, bicycles increase the volume of traffic that our roads can handle. Cycling is good exercise and therefore it seems logical that people are likely to be in better physical shape when they regularly ride a bike, which must have a measurable, positive impact in terms of reduced strain on our health care system.\nI do not consider myself well informed as to the responsibility of our municipal government vs our provincial government when it comes to roads within the municipality but I am assuming the municipal government has jurisdiction. If Torontonians - as represented by the municipal government they have elected - decide to make bicycle lanes a priority, then the provincial government should respect that.\nI agree that congestion of vehicular traffic on our roads is an issue, but I think that creating increased capacity for more cars within the city is only going to make this a bigger problem. I am certain that there are solutions other than more lanes for cars that will lead to better outcomes in terms of road safety, costs, and quality of life for citizens.\nPlease do not reverse the progress our city has made towards safer roads.\n"
