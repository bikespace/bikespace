        "comment": "Please do not get rid of the Yonge, Bloor, and University bike lanes. Me (23) and my dad (55) bike to work everyday on these routes, and my quality of life is higher because I\u2019m able to use these bike lanes. For example, replacing my TTC commute for biking has increased the amount of exercise I get per week and frees up time in my evenings during the weekdays. I\u2019ve lived in Toronto my entire life, and I only started biking recently because of these bike lanes along my work commute. Overall, removing these bike lanes would reduce my quality of life, and limit the opportunity for others in my neighbourhood to increase their quality of life through biking as well.\n"

        "comment": "Good evening, I write this as not just a fellow young 18 year old Ontario resident, and not just Toronto, but all over the region. This seems like legislation that only adds more red tape and bureaucracy, rather than championing the free market and limited government interference that the Conservatives claim to support. Numerous, and I mean countless studies have shown that Bike lanes reduce congestion. Research on this fact, thankfully, is free. I highly recommended to view my linked sources below that back up my claims. This act is seemingly more government intervention, that isn't facts based but is seemingly more concerned with the culture war at large; before election season might I add. Not everyone wants to drive, can afford to drive, or even likes driving. Instead of asking \"Why do we have bike lanes if no one uses them\", we look to WHY no one seemingly uses them. High quality bike lanes (those that are separated from high-speed motor vehicle traffic, rather than a line of paint on the ground), are what we need more of. The Bloor-Danforth bike way, for example, is a pretty good example of high quality bike infrastructure, and the facts don't lie; consumer sales have improved on the corridor since their installation. Why not expand the corridor further with a mode of travel that improves small business, allows more efficient and greener forms of travel in the region, and gives residents the freedom of not having to drive to participate in society? Thank you for reading this, and I hope you don't forget these facts. Also, Doug Ford's $200 tax rebate won't make me be able to afford a car, but it will make me be able to buy a nice bike; that I hope I don't die on from a big SUV driver that was speeding and tells me to just \"bike on the narrow sidewalk\".\n"

Removing bike lanes will not stop me from biking- it will just put the lives of myself and many people I know in danger. It is a total waste of tax payer dollars, and I am in complete opposition to this action. The Province is overreaching, and I find this action to be embarrassing and illogical.\n"

        "comment": "1. Increased Safety: Dedicated bike lanes separate cyclists from vehicles, reducing the likelihood of collisions and making streets safer for all users, including pedestrians and drivers.\n2. Reduced Traffic Congestion: Encouraging cycling as an alternative form of transportation helps to alleviate congestion on Toronto\u2019s roads, especially during rush hours.\n3. Environmental Benefits: Cycling is a zero-emission mode of transportation, contributing to lower pollution levels and helping Toronto reach its climate action goals by reducing greenhouse gases.\n4. Improved Public Health: With more safe biking options, more people can incorporate physical activity into their daily commute, leading to better overall health and lower healthcare costs in the long term.\n5. Economic Boost: Bike-friendly cities often see increased local business traffic, as cyclists tend to stop at local shops and restaurants more frequently than car drivers.\n6. Cost-Effective Infrastructure: Bike lanes are more affordable to build and maintain compared to car lanes, making them a cost-effective way to improve urban mobility.\n7. Less Noise Pollution: With more people choosing bikes over cars, cities can experience a reduction in noise pollution, creating a more pleasant urban environment.\n8. Increased Property Values: Studies have shown that neighborhoods with good cycling infrastructure often experience higher property values, as bike lanes are seen as a desirable feature.\n9. Enhanced Accessibility: Bike lanes provide an alternative for residents who may not have access to cars or prefer not to drive, offering a more equitable transportation option.\n10. Promotion of Sustainable Tourism: Bike lanes make Toronto more accessible and appealing to tourists who enjoy cycling, supporting eco-friendly tourism and showcasing the city as a progressive, green destination.\nToronto has made good progress with creating bike lanes. Don't brings us back 10+ years ago\n"

I recently had an experience getting to work where the bike lane was blocked and required cyclists to go into the car traffic lane. At the site of this blockage, the cars were forced to slow down as bikes merged into the car lane. If this bike lane is fully removed, these bikes will be in the car lane permanently and slow down traffic. Overall, based on my personal experience, I don\u2019t believe that removing the Yonge bike lane will come with the benefits that you\u2019re seeking.\n"

I know so many people (including me and my family) who feel unsafe while biking on Ontario roads, and hence avoid it. The current bike infrastructure is really bad. That's why we have only 2% people biking. Disconnected and unsafe.\nAs a resident of Toronto, I strongly oppose the provincial government\u2019s bill to reduce bike lanes. These lanes are vital for ensuring the safety of cyclists.\n"

        "comment": "This proposal should not go though. It adds unneeded bureaucracy to a province that already struggles to build at cost and on time infrastrucutre. Ontario is growing fast and our infrastructure needs to be keeping pace but adding more red tape to transportation infrastructure and possibly elimination of the bike lanes we have now is antithetical to this goal. Not only does this bill seek to increase time and cost to transit infrastructure, it limits my practical freedom to choose how I want to move around. If there are no bike lanes, what option do I have but to drive. This increases road congestion the very opposite of this bill's stated goal. The Ford government seeks to limit my freedom by making me choose to use my car because no other infrastructure supports anything else.\nThe Ford Government doesn't know what is best for my city and this bill is his way of unduly increasing his reach into the affairs of municiple infrastructure development.\n"

        "comment": "I'm a long-time resident of Etobicoke who walks, uses the TTC frequently, and recently started learning how to ride a bike due to the expansion of the Tangerine RideShare bikes to my area. I've grown up with cars all my life and know how useful they are, and I've also nearly been struck and killed at least twice on intersections in my neighbourhood while I was walking in the middle of a crosswalk. Having infrastructure that encourages safety is paramount - in each case (walking, cycling, driving) the greatest danger to someone is someone else in a car. The new bike lanes going down Bloor and the safety they promised were what encouraged me to start practicing to ride again, and this would have had positive effects on everything from my physical well-being to my mental health. Without these bike lanes? I'm not biking. I've already been in situations where the road has been unsafe for me because of careless drivers, and I'm not willing to put my life on the line and die like many unfortunate cyclists have due to lack of safe cycling space. Being a world-class city means that we have modern infrastructure that provides people choices in how they want to move about, and removing the bike lanes is actively removing that choice for a large group of people for the benefit of drivers only. Traffic was terrible before bike lanes were added, and at the very least that won't change if you remove them. There will just be more people at risk of losing their lives.\n"

This represents massive overreach by Doug Ford and will not be tolerated. There is NO evidence that bike lanes contribute significantly to increased traffic congestion and they make it possible for cyclists to get around the city more safely. Moreover, the cost incurred to remove the bike lanes cannot possibly be justified; only recently have the Bloor bike lanes west of Avenue Rd. been completed.

Both transit and roads are often at capacity during peak times, and if we added the people who bike onto either mode, it'll significantly make traffic and/or crowding worse. One lane is an insignificant amount of road capacity for the amount of safety and choice it offers people.\nA conservative government should be focusing on upzoning and building more housing in downtowns and Toronto in particular, so people don't have to travel long distances to work/school/etc as often. This sort of culture-warring on bike lanes helps no one while making traffic worse.\n"

        "comment": "The provincial government shouldn't be adding red tape and bureaucracy to municipal governments' ability to address local transportation options. Bike lanes are essential transportation routes for thousands of people daily in Toronto, including myself. The removal of bike lane infrastructure has detrimental effects on the basic standards of safety for cyclists. This bill is prioritizing vehicles' ability to get through a city faster over cyclists' personal safety.\nDespite claims that bike lanes slow traffic down and are underutilized, they have the opposite effect. Bike lanes reduce the need for people to drive, which means fewer cars on the road.\nBike lanes also make driving easier. I would much rather drive next to cyclists in dedicated lanes than have cyclists weave in and out of traffic. Removing bike lanes will not reduce the number of cyclists on the road.\nEven if, by some backward logic, the claim that \"bike lanes slow down traffic in the city\" were true, what's still the better outcome here? Drivers arriving at their destination 5 minutes faster OR cyclists arriving at their destination alive?\nTo be clear: I do not support Bill 212.\n"

Do you really think that by removing these bike lanes, cyclists will stop using these roads? The reason those bike lanes were necessary in the first place, was to ensure the safety of the cyclists riding these routes. The only thing that will decrease gridlock is a decrease in the number of cars on the road. We should be expanding our network of bike lanes so that there is a safe and viable alternative to driving; that way we can reduce the number of cars thus creating a Reduction of Gridlock, Saving EVERYONE Time. Making driving even faster just encourages more people to take their cars, which defeats the purpose. THE FEWER CARS ON THE ROAD THE LESS TRAFFIC AND GRIDLOCK!\n"

More bikes mean fewer cars, safer cycling and a boast to small business along routes with bike lanes.  Being a driver and cyclist I believe that the issue with slower traffic in Toronto is the never ending construction, closed lanes for high rise construction and inattentive drivers who crawl along the roads while on their cell phones.  Also the number of food delivery drivers that use the bike lanes will congest traffic once they are moved off of the safe bike lanes.  The fatalities once the bike lanes are removed will mean blood on the hands of the Premier and his cabinet. Is this worth it.\n"

        "comment": "I have multiple significant concerns about this proposal:\n1. Alienation of cyclist commuters. I and many others commute via bike for financial reasons, and owning and operating a motor vehicle can be extremely expensive. As such, the removal and restriction of forward-looking bike infrastructure would limit the ability of those like myself to safely commute to/from work.\n2. Unnecessary waste of taxpayer dollars. Taxpayer money has already been invested to build the bike infrastructure on Bloor Street, Yonge Street, and University Avenue. Proceeding to destroy that (relatively new) infrastructure would be a huge waste of all the money that has already been invested.\n3. Provincial overreach and unnecessary bureaucracy. Requiring provincial review/approval for bike lanes introduces undue bureaucracy and provincial oversight into a clearly municipal matter. This is of particular concern for small towns where the local population may be largely outspoken in the provincial government. These communities should be given the choice to decide what they would like to do with their local transportation infrastructure.\n"

The tax should based on the legal capacity of the vehicle and the number of people in the currently in the vehicle. This would encourage car pooling and people driving smaller vehicles. The number of large SUVs that are designed to carry up to 7 people usually only have 1 or 2 people in them.\nAlso, the city needs to remove restrictions based on the time of day for making left or right turns down secondary and side streets. This would open up the number of options for drivers when planning their routes. If you live in a large city don't expect your street to be off limits to traffic.\nIt would also be nice if the construction on some of the multi use trails to be completed in a timely manner. It's ridiculous that the lower Don trail and Betty Sutherland trail are still under construction. Why does it take this long to complete?\nWe need more traffic policing in Toronto. People do whatever they wish with no consequences.\n"
