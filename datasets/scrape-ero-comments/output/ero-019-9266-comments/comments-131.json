        "comment": "I am strongly against this proposed legislation. It is proposing that any new bike lane either needs to be reviewed by the province (a duplication and waste of time and resources, when municipalities must also review and consult) OR the bike lane must be built into existing green space, when green space is already at a deficit in many municipalities. This will put a huge bottleneck on getting any new bike lanes built, at a time when there is already a significant deficit of cycling infrastructure in our cities that needs to be addressed ASAP.\nI use a bicycle to commute my 3 year old and 1 year old sons to daycare and I also use my bicycle to commute to the GO train station to get to work. If this legislation goes through, and existing bike lanes also get torn up (at a significant cost to society), I will no longer be able to safely commute my sons to daycare as I only use protected bike lanes (of which there are few!). This will result in me being forced to buy a car and go into debt in order to get my sons to daycare safely.\nThere are already many studies that demonstrate cycling infrastructure does not contribute to traffic or car congestion at all (in fact, it improves it). Stop this legislation that ignores the existing evidence, does not address the problem you are trying to solve, and would put my sons' safety at risk!\n"

        "comment": "As usual this Doug Ford conservative government are demonstrating their complete commitment to destroying any moves towards supporting the environment. Let\u2019s be honest that\u2019s what bike Lanes  are for! It\u2019s to encourage people to ride instead of getting in a gas guzzling car that carries usually only a single person. A vehicle which could carry five or six people usually but contains one and spews CO2 emissions along the way.\nThe other shocking thing about this bill is that you would actually reverse decisions that a city has made after a well thought out plan and a lot of money spent!\nRemoving bike lanes and not allowing them in future  is overstepping in a big way and none of Provincial government/Doug Ford\u2019s business.\nI do like the idea of the province buying back the 407 and honestly, you should just make both highways low-cost tow highways If the money is short. If it\u2019s not short, then both should be free. The 407 never should\u2019ve been sold in the first place that was sheer. idiocy of whatever provincial government was in  place during that time. Almost as idiotic as ripping out well thought out, already constructed bike lanes that make cyclists feel safer and make our City more environmentally attractive and also more world class: have you ever been to  Austria or Amsterdam ? They have it right- I\u2019ve been Making it attractive for cyclist for years, and everybody owns a bike there!\n"

        "comment": "There is absolutely no reason to do this, there is no real data to support the idea of bike lanes adding to gridlock. If anything, it's the opposite: the more safe, reliable options you give people to get around the city, the fewer people feel obligated to drive (thus reducing the number of cars on the road). The people in the city of Toronto do not want this and it is an egregious waste of funds that we could be using to solve the housing crisis and improving public transit. Safe cycling infrastructure is the key to solving the gridlock problem and helping to alleviate pollution caused by car traffic. Please focus your time, energy, and funds on what really matters: improving life for the citizens throughout the entire province of Ontario. In addition to my point above about bike lanes actually being a good thing for alleviating traffic, focusing on bike lanes like this is a massive waste of this province's resources and unfair to the residents who do not live in Toronto. Please use the money that would go towards the removal of bike lanes to support the needs of the communities outside of the GTA\n"

        "comment": "This is terrible legislation on multiple levels.\nFirst, it is an absurd overreach of provincial power. Why is the province wasting its time and resources micro managing municipalities?\nSecond, ripping out existing bike lines is just a stupid waste of money.\nYou want to reduce gridlock? Reduce the number of people in cars. Thats it. That is literally the only way. There is endless data demonstrating this. You will not solve gridlock with new lanes, or by pissing away billions of dollars on a tunnel. You need to\na) Divert people away from high density areas. People should not be growing THROUGH Toronto unless their destination is in Toronto\nb) Providing effective alternative transport methods such as robust public transit and avenues for active transport (LIKE BIKE LANES), so people can do things other then drive.\nc) Change zoning laws to allow for more mixed use neighbourhoods so more people can live close to where they work so they dont have to commute, or at the very least, live close to shops and services so they can access the majority of what they need either without a car, or with a very short drive.\nBlatantly ignoring evidence based solutions because the Premier has decided he has a beef with bike lanes for some reason will make gridlock worse, not better, and your time and tax payer money would be better spent addressing issues like Healthcare and Education, that are actually the province's responsibility, instead of micromanaging municipal affairs. If the Premier wants to be mayor of Toronto so badly, he should resign and run in the next election, and leave being Premier to someone who knows what they are doing.\n"

        "comment": "Toronto has finally begun moving in the right direction in terms of creating safe, usable infrastructure in the downtown area that allows for a variety of modes of transportation (cars, bikes, transit, pedestrian). This move by the Ford government to remove controlling authority over these civic design decisions is wrongheaded in the extreme. It ignores the science (of course it does) that proves that congestion increases in lockstep with the number of lanes, meaning that this is not a solution to congestion. It also ignores, amusingly enough, the simple reality that most major arteries in downtown Toronto have been undergoing significant construction projects this year, drastically increasing congestion (for everyone... including bikes). The members of our provincial government might consider a stroll to College and University to see how that intersection has been impacted by a construction-based lane closure, which has delayed cars, cyclists, and pedestrians equally.\nI vehemently oppose the removal of any bike lanes in Toronto or elsewhere in the province. It's time for the province to move forward into a sustainable future together.\n"

        "comment": "This bill is embarrassing. Not only is it a complete overreach by the province into municipal affairs, but it's going to be completely counterproductive. There is no real data to support the idea that bike lanes add to gridlock. All studies, especially those in dense urban areas like Toronto, indicate that bike lanes reduce gridlock by giving people safe, cost-effective alternatives to driving. More bike lanes means more cars off the road, which means less traffic.\nRipping up existing bike infrastructure is an hilariously poor use of taxpayer funds. It will do nothing to address the underlying issue of congestion in our cities.\nThis policy change is just pandering to a set of voters by \"hurting the right people\", in this case the \"right people\" being people who use bike lanes.\nPlease focus your time, energy, and funds on what really matters: improving life for the citizens throughout the entire province of Ontario. This will do the complete opposite, and is just political theatre.\nIf you want to appeal to your constituents outside of City of Toronto, do it by actually working on measures that will improve their lives, such as addressing the poor state of our health care and education systems, instead of focusing on sticking it to the people of Toronto.\n"

        "comment": "Reducing bike lanes only causes more traffic. People will be on the streets with bikes, scooters, mobility devices and other devices that aren't permittes on the sidewalk. This puts pedestrians in danger and causes unsafe driving conditions. Removing bike lanes will not ease congestion, it will make the roads less safe. Pedestrians WILL be using the roads their tax dollars have paid for, but ths government is putting lives at risk. Be better than this. Out safety first.\nBike lanes in other countries are also able to be utilized by emergency services when cars and trucks can't move out of the way.\n"

Thus, I depend on cycling to get me around the city, especially since it is faster than walking, and in most cases, faster than taking public transit.\nI take the Bloor St W bike lane to work. I take the University Ave bike lane to get to appointments, restaurants, shops, shows, etc. downtown. I use these bike lanes because I feel safer on these than riding on Spadina Ave, for example. I also use the bike lanes on College St, Harbord St, Richmond St, and Adelaide St on a regular basis.\nIf these designated bike lanes did not exist, I would not feel safe riding my bike around the city. I would honestly go out less (and therefore spend less at businesses) because of the inconvenience of getting places.\nThere is so much research to show how bike lanes reduce congestion on streets and are better for all road users, including drivers. https://www.cbc.ca/news/science/bike-lanes-impacts-1.7358319\nPlease look at the facts and consider what taxpayers' money would be wasted on if this bill gets passed.\n"

The provincial government doesn't show any convincing evidence that either the gridlock issue will be solved by this, or the biker's safety will be improved. The data quoted so far to support this bill is either out dated, or heavily biased towards car based infrastructure.\n3. Biking has been an CRUCIAL part of my daily commute to the work. In my opinion, Toronto is having such an advantage over other places in terms of the variety of transportation options including biking. I will seriously considering leaving Ontario and contribute to the economy of somewhere else in the North America (maybe Vancouver, Seattle or New York City) because IT IS A SIGN THAT ONTARIO GOVERNMENT HAS NO RESPECT FOR SCIENTIFIC DECISION MAKING AND SO POWER HUNGRY TO OVERRIDE LOCAL RULES RANDOMLY.\nAgain, the opinion from people who want to keep the bike lanes at city level is too big to be ignored. I'm afraid that this bill won't solve anything and from now on bikers will have to SHARE the road with cars which endanger people's lives and WILL CAUSE BIGGER TRAFFIC GRIDLOCKS!\n"

What about hose who walk, bike and take public transit? Are their tax dollars not paid the same as everyone else.\nI drive to work every day. The major issues on my commute are transport trucks. Not cyclists. When I do drive where there are bike lanes, I appreciate that they are kept safe and that they do not need to be in the other lanes. Where will bicyclists ride when there are less bike lanes? They will ride in the same lane as car traffic. Causing slowdowns as they are able to ride in the middle of the lane just as a car would.\nThe plan to remove bikes lanes is just as idiotic as paying penalties to bring booze to convenience store faster. Please stop wasting my tax dollars! Spend them on things that make a measurable difference in all Ontarians lives. Build housing, build shelters, repair roads and infrastructure , fix the health care system with proper investments. Stop actively ruining this province so you can point to broken systems and sell them off to private companies.\nIt\u2019s also transparent that this act is also an attempt to remove checks and balances the Conservative Party doesn\u2019t want to deal with while ramming through other legislation.\nMy only consolation is that as time goes by the absolute depths of the corruption present in the current administration will come to light and we can point to Ford and his cronies as an example why the Conservatives are not worthy of trust or votes.\n"
