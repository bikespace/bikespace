More people will drive and fewer people will ride bicycles.\nIt has been shown again and again that bike lanes reduce traffic congestion and improve local businesses.\nAlso I oppose building highway 413. It's another example of following gut instinct on what improves gridlock without paying attention to scientific evidence.\n"

        "comment": "The provincial government shouldn't be adding red tape and bureaucracy. The Mayor of Toronto is against the proposed removal of bike lanes. As the representative of the people of the City of Toronto the provincial government should not be ignoring the voice of the people. I do not own a car and walking and cycling are how I get places. With the amount of food delivery bikers on the road today if lanes are removed some of these bikers will use sidewalks so they can be more safe. I've been hit by a bike before I don't want this to be a common occurrence. Biking is currently the fastest mode of transportation through certain areas of the city. Removal of bike lanes could affect this. Some of these food delivery bikers will switch to the driving if the lanes are removed which will only increase congestion. The provincial government has also suggested building replacement bike lanes on side streets. On Bloor there is no obvious side street replacement, nothing goes fully parallel with Bloor. Less people will cycle when if it isn't a safe, or worse, people will die. It'll be easier for drivers if bikers have their own lanes, many bikers that need to use Bloor, Yonge, and/or University will continue to use them so they will only clog up traffic more and make congestion worse.\n"

        "comment": "These proposal have no place in reality. They go completely against all principles of a metropole. Cars are too inefficient in big cities and the only way to make cars a viable option to use in a city for those who cannot walk or cycle around is to make sure that as many people who can cycle, bus or walk are able to do it safely. Adding more lanes has been proven over and over again to fail at reducing traffic. There is a reason why driving around Toronto is an absolute nightmare. I drive myself, I even have a pickup and I am 100% against these measure as I am able to see that cycling in a safe environment to go to work will ultimately be better for my wallet, my health and will keep my truck off the road for other people to use the space I am not taking.\nWhy is Doug Ford preventing the local government from doing it's job by meddling in things he has no clue about and even goes against the recommendation of his own cabinet?\n"

        "comment": "This bill would be a disaster for the city of Toronto. A more complete, interconnected  cycling network encourages people to commute via bike and would reduce car traffic over the long term as more people switch modes.\nI am both a driver and a bicyclist, and I think it\u2019s unfair that people who do not own a car will have less choice for commuting. Why should all of our tax money and infrastructure go towards car drivers? Should we remove sidewalks too? Why not have roads dedicated just to cars covering every part of the city? Cyclists, pedestrians, handicapped people be damned.\nThere are more than enough studies that show expanding car lanes DO NOT solve congestion over the long term, and that more bike lanes and pedestrian-friendly roads are better overall for the communities in which they exist. The problem is that this provincial government is intent on prioritizing its own interests rather than doing actual research on why more complete streets benefit large cities. Just look at some of the most vibrant cities in Europe and even in North America (Montreal, Vancouver) to see the result of designing streets for all modes of transportation.\nAs a Canadian, as a Torontonian, I am ashamed of this government\u2019s decision-making process. This regressive bill would set the city back 20 years. Please make complete streets a priority. This city will be worse off if you don\u2019t.\n"

        "comment": "The bike lanes of Bloor, Yonge, and University are essential for the growing cycling network of Toronto and people who use them daily to commute around the city. As a healthcare worker myself. I use the University bike lanes even when on call at all hours of the night. Its the most reliable and quickest way between my home and work. Especially during those emergency calls when I have to be at work within a certain time window to join my call team and help save someones life. Even when I ride home after a very tiring shift at any hour of the night. I know that i'm far safer riding on a separated bike lane than mixing with motor vehicles. I've been cycle commuting for over a decade now and these lanes are a godsend!\nI can see that the city has invested alot of tax dollars in trying to improve congestion by giving people alternative modes of transportation. I find that this bill is a waste of that investment if we are to reverse course, and from studies around the world; probably will not even help with alleviating the traffic congestion caused by car traffic in the first place. Please reconsider this move. Thanks\n"

I am frankly dismayed and somewhat bewildered by this move from the Ontario government to limit bike lanes. I believe that streets should be made for people, and not just those who can afford to drive. I believe that what \"saves us time\" is safe, reliable public transportation options.\nThe idea of people from outside of Toronto making decisions about what Toronto should or shouldn't do with its money and its roads, following a process of local needs assessments and consultations, seems to me a major jurisdictional overreach contradicting Doug Ford's earlier comment with respect for fourplex development: \"I believe in letting municipalities determine what is good for their communities and what is not good for their communities\".\n"

        "comment": "Cycle commuting and cycle transportation in cities brings significant community. health, economic and environmental benefits. Countless studies demonstrate that dedicated cycling lanes facilitate stronger local businesses in neighbourhoods and also are a beneficial complement to densification of housing and so an important part of responding Ontario's current housing challenges. The argument made by the Provincial Government that cycling lanes contribute to road congestion is not supported by science and the intervention of the Provincial Government in municipal decision-making is contrary to decades of proven jurisdictional practice in the province.\nOf even more importance, dedicated bike lanes have been demonstrated in cities around the world and across Canada to improve safety not just for cyclists but also for motorists. Dedicated cycle lanes calm traffic while also providing a protected space for cyclists to commute in safety.  Removing cycling lanes will force cyclists on busy arteries to ride with cars in traffic, which will reduce safety, slow the movement of vehicles, increase accidents, and by consequence lead to greater traffic challenges.  The tragic human risks of fatal accidents that can arise from removing bike lanes should be sufficient for a responsible Provincial Government to rethink its position. However, given that the Provincial Government has predicated its position on the incorrect assumption that bike lanes cause congestion, when integrating bicycles into vehicle traffic has a far greater impact on unpredictable vehicle movement and traffic delays due to interactions between slower bicycles and faster vehicles.\nThe Provincial Government has made clear its commitment to responding to Canada's affordability crisis. I have been a cycle commuter for over a decade largely due to its affordability versus other forms of transportation.  The policy being advocated by the Provincial Government will remove the most affordable method of urban commuting available to residents of Ontario cities at a time when affordability is the most pervasive challenge facing Ontarians.\nCycle commuting is not only more affordable and more healthy, it is more efficient. The average single lane of private motor-vehicle traffic has a capacity of between 600 and 900 vehicles per hour, representing between 600 and 1,800 people. By contrast, the average two-way protected bike lane (which typically occupies less space than a single lane of traffic), has a capacity of 7,500 people per hour. Bike lanes appear empty because they are dramatically more efficient in moving people than car lanes. They can be up to 10 times more efficient for supporting commuters in a thriving downtown than car lanes.\nI am one of thousands of cycle commuters in my city who could be negatively impacted by this legislation and I am stridently opposed to it. It is short-sighted and is an example of Provincial Government overreach out of its traditional areas of authority.  Commuting is a local issue best managed by local governments. Thanks to investments made by my city in separated bike lanes over the past two years, I enjoy for the first time in over a decade a safe commute to my workplace. Cyclists will continue to commute by bicycle with or without dedicated bike lanes. Their removal will increase congestion and risk.  Every injury and death of a cyclist caused by the risks created by removal of a bike lane by this Provincial Government's legislation will be the direct consequence of this error in law and policy made without the benefit of forethought or scientific analysis. Each injury and each death caused by this reduction in safe commuting will arguably be the direct responsibility of the Premier and his government.\n"

Look at the data: Bike lanes saves lives. More line bike infrastructure that a city builds the more people use it. More cyclists means less cars clogging up streets. The data also shows that other measures can be used to improve traffic flow like signal timing.

        "comment": "I live in down town Toronto. This year I started biking in Toronto using the Tangerine Bike Share system. I estimate that it has reduced my car usage by 85%. The bike lanes on Bloor and University have been essential to my commutes. If they are removed, for my safety, I will have no choice but to drive to more destinations.\nThe removal of the bike lanes on Bloor and University would be bad for me and bad for Toronto.\nSecondly, as a matter of principle, the Province should not be getting involved with the details of city planning. The provinces job in this regard is to set broad goals and let individual municipalities figure out how to adjust to match those goals.\nThirdly, a bill to address traffic without the introduction of congestion pricing is absurd. The only way to reduce traffic is to reduce the number of cars on the road. This can be done by having more alternatives to cars (bike lanes and public transit) or by making cars more expensive to drive (congestion pricing). Ideally the city moves towards both options. Again, it should be the city's decision, not the Province's.\n"

If there are issues on Bloor Street, let's look at the data and talk with the community to find compromises, as Olivia Chow has already done.  But to arbitrarily remove bike lanes on Bloor, Yonge and University, ignoring the municipality's jurisdiction, the long consultative process that was implemented and the data regarding usage is irresponsible.\nI understand studies have shown that creating more road capacity simply encourages more people to drive increasing congestion again.  That was certainly my experience when I lived in Ajax and the number of 401 lanes was expanded.\nClimate change is already here.  We need to continue to invest in alternative forms of transportation.  This government has rightly invested heavily in mass transportation in Toronto.  Let's refocus the rest of our transportation spend on getting Canadians out of cars.\n"

        "comment": "If gridlock in downtown streets is a concern for drivers, they should use alternative modes of transportation like GO Transit, trams and bicycles.  As more people live in the downtown core of our cities, people need to get around their communities.  Those who live and work in bike accessible neighbourhoods want to be able to safely use their streets.  Bicycles can be used by all age groups and by people of all physical abilities to get to work, school and shopping.  Cars downtown are for people who can afford a car and have the means to arrive to the city from the suburbs however they choose. Bike lanes are for the masses of people who are commuting within the region. University Avenue is a prime example of where bike lanes are necessary for people who live and work downtown. Bloor is a neighbourhood street with communities all along itz not a race track.\nThe province is responsible for the 400 highways, the GO transit, and whatever Metrolinx is. They don't need to tell my town how to install street infrastructure, they need to encourage alternative transit modes.\n"

The reason people don't bike is the lack of proper infrastructure. If we always followed this circular reasoning, then Toronto would just become more and more car-dependent, and car dependency is proven to be an expensive problem to have due to the fact that car infrastructure is crazy expensive in terms of building costs and maintenance costs.\nI hope this bill doesn't go through, as it would be detrimental to the urban fabric of Toronto.\n"
