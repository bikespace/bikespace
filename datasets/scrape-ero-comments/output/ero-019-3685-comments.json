        "comment":": training trialing areas\nI am writing to you as the president of both, the Ontario sporting dog assoc. and the Ontario training and trialing assoc. We the OSDA and the OTTA   wish to express our strong  support on behalf of our over thirty three thousand  members towards the changes that have been brought forward concerning the training and trialing  areas. It is important for the future of our sport and the heritage activity of hunting with dogs that new areas are allowed to be built as we have lost a lot of the areas that people were training there dogs in due to attrition over the years . These training enclosures give us in a safe place to train our dogs with our kids and enjoy the sport of hunting and trialing with our dogs In a secure and safe environment for not only our dogs safety but all the people that are participating.\nYours Sincerely\n                          John Bell  President OSDA and OTTA\n",

Training and trailing preserves are crucial to our sport. They not only provide a safe and controlled environment to compete and excercise our animals it\u2019s a great oprutunity to introduce  youth hunters to hunting in a safe manner, and teach them the ethics involved in hunting, It also allows fellow houndsmen and women to pass down the time honoured tradition of hound hunting to our children that is the heritage of many of our family\u2019s. I look forward to seeing this come to fruition.\nSincerely Andrew Grice  president of the Augusta foxhound association.\n",

It is feared by many that the sport will die without these proposed changes.\nWorking with hounds is truly a cradle to grave hobby. Families of all ages regularly attend these events , in the outdoors, enjoying all aspects of the sport. Unfortunately the average age of hounds people is rising but with these changes, it is hoped more people will take interest and join in.\nIf this proposal is passed it will truly be a breath of fresh air to a sport that has been on the decline because of existing rules and regulations.\nThanks for working with Ontario hounds people and trying to do the right thing for the sport.\n",

Our property rights are eroded.\nTraining, exercising and providing enrichment opportunities for our hounds is paramount .\nAt one time you could obtain a training license for some  types of game, I don't know if they are still available . Regardless there is additional risk in running in areas with roads, train tracks, etc.\nBeagle Clubs, Retriever clubs , foxhound clubs deserve the opportunity to continue our sport. Having the current facilities , although very scarce, is a wonderful way to train our hounds. To socialize with fellow outdoors men.

Away from traffic and outside elements that can interfere with the safety of the hounds and the handlers of said hounds. As a younger hound handler in the sport it is imperative to have the opportunity to have facilities like this. The more the better. Limiting or reducing these facilities only puts added pressure to already stressed locations. The existing locations are over run with those trying to get in to such places. Which in turn puts added and undo stress on the game with in the facility. The amendment may  also allow for young handlers to have more choices that may very well be closer to them. Which allows them to participate more if able to? As an individual from Southwestern Ontario that recently had to step away from the handling of hounds due to the distance to the closest facility. Or ability to get in to a closer one because it was already full. I found myself traveling 4.5hrs at times in the past to allow me to find a safe and secure place to train and handle my hounds. Which limited my ability to spend time with my wife as well as the added cost of such distance. Fuel, vehicle wear and tear and any additional expenses incurred during the travels. Priced my son and I out of a activity that we loved and shared together. It also took away from the history that had been shared to me and I hoped to pass along to my children. I FULLY support this amendment.\nMy only concern is the 90day limitation. Other than that I believe this is conducive to quality training in a safe and secure manner for both hounds and the game mentioned in the proposal.\n",

We started trialling approximately four years ago and quickly fell in love with the sport. Although it is a competitive sport, we have met several wonderful people who not only welcomed us to the sport but who took the time to help us learn and grow with our dogs.\nAs an animal lover in general, I am able to understand both sides to the argument of amending this bill. There are may people out there that assume this sport is barbaric and we all gather to watch our dogs hunt and kill wildlife that are held captive in a fenced area. This is NOT the case. During a trial, the amount of dogs allowed in an area is capped and there are always humans spread throughout the area who not only judge the participating dogs and their skills but who monitor the areas and can intercept if by chance a dog does come into close contact with the wildlife. Although it has happened, we do not like to see any animals hurt and do everything in our power to prevent this from happening. Trial\/Training areas are typically full of people who love the sport and their dogs alike. Most houndsmen grew up trialling dogs with their parents and grandparents; this is a tradition for most. It is truly enjoyable to watch the children of my fellow houndsmen engage with the dogs and learn about the sport. Please don't let this tradition die. I agree that there should be strict guidelines for pen owners, please give them a chance to prove to everyone that this sport is not abusive in any way shape or form to either the hounds who are hunting or the wildlife that is being hunted. Those who do not agree with the amendment of this bill should be introduced to this sport the way I was because then they could better understand what transpires during a trial and be able to see the whole picture and not just the part of they have fabricated in their heads to be evil and abusive.\nAs mentioned above I am an animal lover. If we look at the bigger picture, dogs of all breeds should be engaged in outdoor activities, they are not meant to be kept indoors laying on couches; this is unhealthy for K9s. My husband and I treat all of our dogs as family. They are very well taken care of and I wish you could see the excitement when they know they are going to the penn to run off their energy and hone in one their hunting skills.\nFor me this is a harmless sport that does not affect the community or any other person outside of the hound community.\n",

The establishment of additional Train and Trialing Areas and the Transfer of Existing Licences is long overdue.\nThere is a large number of houndsmen that utilize these areas to train pups on the trail of desired game and exercise adult dogs in order to eliminate conflict in the summer months with livestock and standing crops.\nThese Training and Trialing Areas have been declining in numbers due to attrition with the death of the present licence holder or with the dispersal of the licensed property.\nThese areas add an economic benefit especially when competitive trials are organized.  These events positively impact local restaurants, motels, B&B\u2019s and other businesses.

        "comment":"Bird dogs play an important role in upland hunting, and having a well-trained dog is key to hunter success which provides several safety and environmental benefits.\nSince 1997, half of the training grounds used by dog handlers has been lost which reduces training opportunities and results in less effective bird dogs.\nHunters who use dogs do not shoot birds off the ground which improves both safety for dogs, other trail users and also gives birds a fair opportunity to escape (\"fair chase\").\nUse of well trained bird dogs also has several positive environmental impacts: It greatly improves the chances of recovering a wounded or dead bird which will count towards a hunters bag limit. It also helps hone a dogs instinct to point vs catching and killing a possibly unlimited number of birds themselves, instead allowing the hunter to shoot the bird and count that towards his or her bag limit.\nFinally, while I'm not aware if this happens in Ontario yet, there are several jurisdictions in the US where trained bird dogs are used for field research to band birds to gather conservation data. Having a well trained dog is absolutely crucial during conducting field research on ground nesting birds to ensure that it doesn't kill vulnerable nesting chicks.

The majority of ubanites are not aware of traditional\/ancestorial activities and how they have contributed to the Canada we now have.  A lot of these folks are opposed to anything involving \"hunting\" and the use of cultivated game for possible training purposes. As voters they tend to steer governments eg. Ontario's Provincial Govt policies and actions to react to the lowest common denominator - masses of urban dwellers at the expense of a more \"out of doors\" contingent. This is wrong.  Not to appear biased, but if natives\/aboriginal communities want to expand training activities or set up new training sites, the Government would quickly capitulate and if nothing else, allow such sites and activities to operate under the radar\/outside of the law.\nThe fact that training locations have disappeared speaks volumes. The Government is tacitly shutting down these facilities - making it impossible for them to continue. The bureaucrats who push these agendas likely never participate in said activities.\nI want to see these activities expanded.  People like myself should not have to be excluded from said activities because facilities are way too distant to access or have become too exclusive and expensive to avail facilities and services.  More competition will lower costs (supply\/demand) and allow more folks to participate in training activities and further knowledge about interest in hunting dogs.\nOntario needs to support access to lands and activities which take place in more natural, rural, and out door settings.

The existing spaces that I frequent seem to provide much better habitat for all species of wildlife than any other yard or agricultural use properties. Sure there\u2019s pressure on wildlife from people and dogs, but not nearly as much as in a person\u2019s yard or any cultivated field. Additionally, dog sports are great! Why would we limit the available resources for dog sports? There are no pointing dog field trials in Ontario at all, presently, that I\u2019m aware of. There are CKC and NAVHDA hunt tests, but no field trials. There are some retriever field trials, which require less space, but no pointing dog trials. There used to be pointer field trials at Hullett Marsh, I hear. But, the other test sites and training properties I know of aren\u2019t really big enough for proper pointing dog field trails. In the US, the participation numbers for field trials are huge. There are multiple events every weekend. I\u2019m competing in pointing dog field trials in Ionia, Michigan three of the next four weekends. That state recreation area looks to be about 10,000 acres and has 2,000 acres of dedicated field trail courses. They have road signs directing people to it. It is a focal point of that community. The closest training grounds to me in Milton, Ontario are more than an hour drive away in Caistor Centre, which makes the sport expensive in commuting costs. We could definitely use more options. I\u2019m not sure why a new opportunity would be limited to 90 days, either. This is a good way to use land. And new business ventures often take more than a few months to cook up.

        "comment":"The opportunity for new ownership transfer of training facilities is outstanding news!   Running hounds in training pens has become a great family bonding experience with my children and I.     They absolutely love seeing all the foxes in the pen we frequent and watching the puppies improve their hunting skills. The children and I both are constantly amazed at just how beautiful and clever these foxes are! To be able to do this in a controlled environment where the dogs can fairly easily be caught and cause no issues to other landowners all through the year is fantastic. We have all been very concerned that these outings were in jeopardy of ending with the inability to transfer ownership of the training facility to any other owner.   Many of the remaining facilities in our area are owned by older individuals and without the option of ownership transfer these training pens would have to close down.    We will be following the progress of this proposal closely with high hopes that our family traditions are able to continue!!\n",

We fought to have training and trialing compounds prohibited altogether.  However, a compromise was reached. The new Act prohibited the establishment of new dog training facilities using wild animals, but it grandfathered existing operations.  The intent was to phase out them out through attrition because Ministry staff recognized the inherent cruelty of these operations which involved trapping coyotes, foxes, and rabbits to be supplied to operators of compounds, a fenced in area where dogs would be permitted to chase, harass and often kill these wild animals. Since 1997 this policy worked well.\nHowever, under your leadership, Mr. Ford, you now intend to permit one of the most egregious forms of cruelty to continue:  pitting domestic dogs against confined wildlife.  The Ministry provides very little information about these operations and that is, likely, no accident.  If Ontarians knew that these activities were approved by your government, I know and your officials likely know, they would be horrified.\nWe suggest the following solution. Transition compounds that use wildlife to facilities that use scent tracking to train dogs with no confined wildlife involved.  This humane policy would allow dog owners the opportunity to safely train their dogs to track and retrieve without the cruelty and would allow these businesses to remain open.\nI urge you, in the strongest possible terms, to end this cruelty.  We have presented the government with a humane solution.  However, should the current proposal be implemented by your government, we intend to publicly expose the reality of these facilities and the government\u2019s complicity in perpetuating the cruel activities that even previous Ministry staff knew were seriously problematic.\nSincerely,\n",

Currently there have enforcement issues with hunters using hounds to hunt deer and\/or coyotes. Hound hunters need facilities to train their dogs to come on command be it through whistles or shocks and beeps with collars. Having the dogs run at large for training will surely cause issues.\nThe animals in the compounds soon learn how to evade the dogs in the locations of cover provided. It is costly for compound owners to replace animals. The compound owners I know will ban any dogs that are overly aggressive with the compound animals. The last thing they want is for the animals to be harmed.\nI believe this is a fair and reasonable proposal.\nKerry Coleman\n613-791-7515\n",

I have run beagles for 25 years and having a safe enclosure for training and trialing helps to ensure that off game running doesn't happen and that fatal encounters with automobile traffic also doesn't happen.  It would be a sad day if the Canadian Kennel Club and the other sporting dog community members could no longer exercise their canine breed's heritage due to lack of safe running grounds across the province.  I think even 90 days isn't enough to ensure that our hunting heritage is allowed to continue in safe places, especially in southern Ontario and the timeframe should be much longer for setting up and transferring license agreements to others.  Thank you for considering my suggestion of a longer open period and making the necessary amendments to the legislation to allow for our children to enjoy sporting dogs as their grandparents have.

To trap an animal that has no means with which to escape and subjecting it to terror in order to allow some middle-aged men to have some fun is an abomination.  It would be an embarrassment to the province of Ontario, the people who live here.  What would that say about us to the other provinces who are working towards more ethical, humane treatments of animals?\n-in 2019, the following poll results were released by Research Co; the majority of Canadians are opposed to using animals in rodeos (59%); hunting animals for sport (85%); keeping animals in zoos or aquariums (52%) and killing animals for their fur (75%).\n-in 2021, 88% of Canadians supported an end to all cosmetic testing on animals.\n- an August 2019 nationally representative poll showed that 73% of Canadians believe it is important that the government of Canada passes stronger legislation to protect animals and ensure they do not experience pain and suffering\nStatistics clearly demonstrate that the vast majority of Canadians would be adamantly opposed to these penned dog hunting facilities. So why would it ever make sense to approve these? Who is the government serving? The 0.0005% of the country who would participate in an abhorrent activity like this?\nDo the right thing, and do not approve these licenses. It is a huge step backwards.  All existing facilities need to be closed.\n",

I submit that it is equally cruel to use wild creatures to \"train\" hunting dogs. To be blunt, I find both to be disgusting practices.\nOpening applications again--after 25 years--is a step back in time. There is no reason for facilities like this to exist in Ontario. Rather than opening applications, the province should be closing the 24 facilities that already exist.\n",

The capture, confinement and inevitable totrure and inhumane death of sentient, intelligent, and eco system critical species, should be clearly recognized as antiquated and damaging both psychological for the dogs used as well the humans taking part. But the pure terror and pain those foxes, rabbits and coyotes must endure is truly mind boggling. If this act sees the changes the proposed I personally will never support or respect any Ontario fish and wildlife officials. The fact this is even being discussed is embarrassing. Use some real data on the damage being doing by animal agriculture instead of helping others inflict more strain and pain on an already burdened and terrorized eco system. The coyotes, foxes and rabbits are native self sustaining community members. The ranchers worried about their invasive cows horses and garden plots should be working with native ecology not against it. Hopefully someone there with a degree and half a heart and brain will ensure this changes never see the light of day. These dogs can be trained other ways. If it's harder for the owners, so be it. It's a \"sport\" and they can take the 10,000 hours it takes to perfect it without the undue suffering and damage penned training facilities attribute to.\n",

Just because the Ministry is receiving requests does not mean it is acceptable!  To even consider bringing back licensing that has not been allowed for decades is absolutely astounding and a lack of progressive thinking.  We are not in the dark ages.  This is catering to an extremely small segment of the population at the cost of our dwindling wildlife.  And at the cost of our humanity.  If racing greyhounds can be trained with fake rabbits, why not hunting dogs?  Creativity is needed here, not prehistoric thinking!\n",

Just to begin, a wild animal running to escape a dog would suffer such fear that it could die from the trauma, it could be caught and suffer a painful death and it could well be forced to run into a fence and die that way.\nWe should never take the position that rabbits, for example, are part of a population which are least threatened by extinction so some of them can be exposed to terrible trauma. That is inhumane. The Canadian government recently banned the testing of cosmetics on animals and now the Ontario government wants to do this? Completely retrograde.\nAs well, there is no method of trapping an animal like a fox on a trap line which does not cause pain and terrible fear. There\u2019s no need to provide documentation here.\nIn addition, there are no guarantees that hunting dogs are kept in humane conditions and not confined to pens and inclement weather for long periods. Competitions to see which is the best and most aggressive will only exacerbate this situation.\nThis isn\u2019t the 1800s. We\u2019re informed now about the trauma which all animals suffer and to imagine that one or five species are worthy of less compassion is just a dark comment on humans.

Penned hunting\/training is cruel as the animals used to train hunting dogs in penned hunting suffer terribly and this practice should be ended, not expanded with even more facilities being permitted.\nUsing wild animals is also dangerous as the traps used to obtain these animals can injure other animals and pets and even children.\nPets are also at risk because training dogs to hunt animals makes them vicious to other small animals--like cats or small breed dogs like Yorkshire terriers. This propensity for violence greatly increase the risk to these dogs used for hunting to be euthanized.\nThe use of wild animals is harmful as taking any animals out of their natural environment is destructive to ecosystems as it creates an imbalance--fewer foxes means more rats, less rabbits due to trapping for penned hunts means less food for coyotes and more of them entering urban due to hunger. Not to mention all the invasive plants rabbits help keep under control.\nThere is nothing good about penned hunting facilities so to allow more of them instead of shutting down the ones currently operating begs the question who is this for? Not people or their pets, not the environment, not the wildlife, not even the hunting dogs. Just the small percentage of the public who hunt and an even smaller percentage of hunters that use dogs in this way.\nNo, Ontario must not allow any more of these facilities and should be working to shut down the ones we have.\nThank you.\n",

What kind of a \"service\" is this to hunters?  I have never heard of such cruelty to keep wildlife penned up to be used as \"bait\" for dogs that are forced to hunt.  I strongly oppose this cruel decision!  If hunters are \"allowed\" to hunt, they should be doing this using their own means.  Imagine a \"school\" to train hunting dogs?  This is going much too far!  Canada, a beautiful country, should have much, much higher standards for hunters to exercise their \"sport\".  Our wildlife is suffering as it is by losing so much habitat;  wildlife is disappearing.  This \"training centre\" will only serve to speed up the loss of habitat and loss of wildlife.  Does a rabbit, deer, or coyote have a chance to avoid being killed by a ruthless hunter who is accompanied by trained, hunting dogs.  No, Canada, you are going too far.  let's leave our wildlife to the wild, not to trained hunting dogs!\n",

Discovering that some people or business operators have licenses to carry on this cruel activity is pretty shocking.   It puts me in mind of the arguments of some people that they have a right to own and enjoy hand guns. Where did we get the right to USE our wildlife in this way?  Hunting should be done by those who enjoy pursuing animals in their natural habitat and who expect to consume their prey.  for food.\nIf it requires frank animal abuse to train dogs this practice should, in my opinion, be outlawed. Dogs can compete for their owners & trainers in many ways and don't need to be chasing will animals kept captive for this purpose. We no longer use real foxes for the dogs to pursue in equestrian hunting. This is a number of reasons but \"Hunting\" still goes on with horses and dogs going cross country after the scent, not the actual animals.\nWhy kill eat coyotes, foxes and the wild rabbits,  animals dogs will go on to be be repeatedly ordered to chase in the wild ?  I am disgusted to realize that there are people who want to train dogs to go after wild animals for sport +\/- competition. Humans are themselves terrified of being chased and attacked by dogs. What are these people thinking ?\nWe would not let domestic animals be put through the torture of being hunted. The trainers and hunters would be charged under the law. For wild animals, simply being captured by a trap is a horror. You can't do that with rabbits because they would very likely go into shock  and die from the fright and pain. Other animals will die as a result of trap injuries, starvation or exposure.\nAll over the world people are rethinking our \"right\" to keep wild animals in captivity at all.  In my opinion, all these these facilities should wind down and have their licenses expire.  The properties can be put to other uses which could include dog training. Just not THAT kind. We have the imagination to come up with other competitive activities for our dogs.\n",

It is unfortunate that our  government seems to think there may be a place for this kind of cruelty. All of these train and trial facilities should be closed and no new ones opened. Hunting pens are inhumane and unethical. Ethical hunters do not promote cruelty to wildlife. This proposal 019-3685 for further licenses to promote cruel practices should be rejected!!\nI was unable to make use of the usual computer process to make comments on this proposed legislation  on the Environmental Registry.  I have no need for any special privacy procedures and I have no problem being identified with my comments. Thanking you for this opportunity to comment on this legislation.\n",

I have been a bird hunter for over 40 years and much of that time I have had and used a dog.  I realized early on that hunting with a dog generally meant more success, but more importantly it seemed like the ethical thing to do for me.  Even with just amateur training (as part of a club) I found bird retrieval increased dramatically with a dog.    I feel it is import that responsible hunters have a legitimate venue to do their dog training and they need opportunities to do this without having to travel arduous distances for the very few spots that are still licensed.\n",

It would mean condoning cruel treatment to animals who have no way to defend themselves as they are unable to escape to safer surroundings.  This is totally unacceptable in todays society where we need to respect and treat animals, whether house pets or wild animals with respect.  I do not understand how any thinking, feeling human being can consider this appropriate today.  The existing facilities that currently operate need to be shut down immediately and no new ones should be permitted to exist.  There has to be a more humane way to train dogs to hunt other than using animals who are helpless to defend themselves against this monsterous practice.  To turn this around it would be like penning people while wild animals train their young how to track and hunt.  That is a practice that would be condemned immediately and never allowed to exist.  We need to treat all animals the way we want to be treated.  These are animals with feelings, feel pain, fright, etc. the same as humans do.

These animals never consented to being held in captivity, hunted down and killed. Wild animals are moreover crucial to our very existence and the numbers of many species is frighteningly dwindling. They are all part of our precious eco-system, the conservation of  which should be our priority. As an Ontario voter, I urge you to delete this proposal for good and shut down any remaining facilities.\n",

Animals do not exist for the barbaric purposes of people and in my opinion, hunters have far more power than they should. To hunt down wildlife so they can be kept in captivity until they are given to the dogs to tear apart is not just cruel but irresponsible. They are not merely disposable objects but are living and feeling beings and there does not  need to be scientific facts to speak of because it is an ethical issue. Is this what Ontario thinks is a good plan? It says a lot about not just Ontario but too many of the people there. I live where hunters also have a lot of leeway and do despicable things. I would like to think that people are getting better but too often I find the opposite for many. The facilities that sadly are already set up but that does not mean they should last. I suspect the dogs too will be treated like disposable objects if they do not perform well as hunting dogs often are. Canada has many beautiful aspects and places. I have been to St. Joesph's Island more than once but Ontario shows its ugly side here but Canada has done that before. No country is perfect and there is a vast need everywhere for the better treatment of all animals.As I have said many times, humans are not special or the most\/only important species but merely the one with the power-power that is too often abused.

Not only is chase hunting with dogs a cruel and barbaric hunting method, it also has detrimental impacts on the ecosystem. If white-tailed deer for instance are constantly being harassed by dogs chasing through their habitat, the deer will abort their fetuses when stressed even though the deer are not the target of the hunt. Also this hunting method has a dreadful impact on ground nesting birds, who will abandon their nests and nesting grounds. Since coyote hunting started around 2017 in our area, we hardly have any wildlife left. Coyote hunters often hunt continuously and the same area for months on end.\nMany of these so called coyote hunters never bother asking landowners for permission to run their dogs on their property. They just do it. Where I live in Eastern Ontario near Smiths Falls, hunting dogs have almost caused several collisions on busy highway 43! Is it really worth the risk of causing a serious collision worth satisfying the needs of a handful of hunter?\nFurthermore, coyotes are a vital part of the ecosystem to thin out sick and diseased animals like deer with chronic wasting disease\nAs many countries around the world have realized the negative impact of chase hunting with dogs has on the ecosystem as well as how utterly cruel and outdated this hunting method is, Ontario apparently wants to revert to the middle ages!\nUsing dogs as bait to train fighting dogs is illegal, so why are these so called training facilities not illegal as well???

I would like to share my professional perspective, as someone who has observed the behaviour of wild animals in captivity and in the wild:\nThis proposal, if it passes, is a regression in environmental and scientific progress. If Ford or any other policy-maker had a background in science, animal behaviour or animal welfare, they would realize that this is inhumane. Reading the proposal makes me incredulous, as it violates the basic principles of animal welfare. In the past years, there has been a huge push-back against canned hunting and English fox and hound-type hunting. It's now being recognized as archaic and backwards, as it causes huge mental distress to wildlife, and prolongs their suffering before their death. A death that does not tend to be quick or painless either.\nThere are hundreds of scientific studies outlining the increase in cortisol (stress hormone) and behavioural changes that wild species display when we are in their territory. A territory that is ever-shrinking since environmental protections seem to be diminishing under the current provincial government. To take that a step further and ensure that wild species cannot avoid us and WILL be stressed and prevented from exhibiting natural behaviours, in the name of training hunting dogs, is shocking. Rabbits, for one, are flight animals and will do all within their power to avoid predatory species (including dogs). They have a sensitive sense of smell and WILL know when dogs are present.\nFrankly, wildlife should not be contained, especially in the manner described in this proposal, and allowing this to happen on private land opens the doors for lack of regulation and abuse.\nWe have to ask ourselves if our entertainment is worth causing suffering and distress to other creatures.\n",

One wonders why, after over 2 decades, there is a proposal to reverse a province wide ban on these so called 'train and trial areas' when they were banned in 1997 for good reasons. I am disappointed with this province's regressive policies that benefit very few people, and that the majority of people are against; the majority of people are against hunting for sport. The priorities of this province are bizarre considering all of the crises we are going through, yet we are focusing on bringing back outdated and horrific practices of animal abuse for no clear purpose.

        "comment":"I believe the train and trial pens are archaic and have no place in the future of Ontario. We have strong animal welfare standards that prohibit animal fighting and I believe that this hunting training practice is no different than what we actively prohibit. Under section 16(1) of the Ontario Animal Welfare Services Act, \"No person shall encourage, promote, arrange, conduct, assist in, receive a financial or material benefit for or take part in,\n(a) the training of an animal to fight with another animal; or\n(b) any meeting, competition, exhibition, pastime, display or event at or in the course of which an animal fights another animal.\nThe above is exactly what train and trial facilities are all about, by the mere definition! They take a wild animal into captivity and hunting dogs are trained to fight another animal (a). These train and trial facilities include the gathering of hunters, judges, and spectators to observe and rate the gruesome display of which an animal fights another animal as an event, display, pastime, exhibition, and competition (b). The wild animal is given no chance at survival as fences are erected to prevent escape and often several dogs are released upon one prey animal. Firearms are not permitted so the wild animal is mauled to death for human entertainment. Hunting has become no longer about \"feeding the family\" but rather a barbaric sport where killing is fun and something to be praised. If it were truly about hunting and valuing the animal for the nutrition and material it can offer the hunter, there would be no competition or judges to \"rate\" how \"good\" the dog is at killing. Even if the theory of the practice was simply to train the dogs to track and lure the wild animal and it wasn't supposed to be about the killing, the end result will always be bloodsport. The wild animal is stressed and confined and will, in all likelihood, choose to fight when flight is no longer an option. The end result is a distressed wild animal fighting for it's life, triggering a pack response in the dogs, and ultimately, a pack of dogs attacking and killing the wild animal. As it currently stands, the Fish and Wildlife Conservation At advises against both train and trial (sec. 35) and hunting wildlife in captivity (sec. 41), unless the person is licensed to do so under the regulations. This leads an individual to believe that, generally speaking, the practice is frowned upon and must be regulated to ensure hunters do not abuse it. Yet, we propose opening up applications to open new facilities across Ontario? Offering even a 90-day period is unreasonable and irresponsible. This approach is a weak attempt to appease the few involved in this activity and goes against all current legislation as well as public interests. There are other, more ethical ways to approach hunting dog training that do not include forcing the dog into fighting a wild and confined predator species. I strongly vote against this new proposal and do not wish to see these amendments in the legislation.\n",

In my area dogs charging through the bush have ruined hunts for some people and have annoyed other land owners.\nThere is a larger question though. Why are people still training to hunt foxes and coyotes? Going back several generations hunters have been trying to clear out the coyotes so there will be more deer. Are there fewer coyotes? No. They respond to pressure by breeding faster. For all practical purposes hunting them is a waste of time.\nSo why are they being hunted in the wild? Is it just the thrill of the chase and then a kill for the dogs and\/or the hunter. Is it just a blood sport then?\nFoxes and coyotes and\/or wolves have been part of the natural balance in Ontario for a long time. They don't drive down deer populations. Other factors are much more important. They are important for keeping the field mouse population from exploding and they are efficient scavengers.\nIt would be a benefit to Eastern wolves and the hybrid coyotes if hunting with dogs was outlawed. Many jurisdictions do not allow it.\nWhat to do with the hound owners then? I guess giving them places to train and trial is better than having them killing the natural wildlife.\nWhat are conditions REALLY like for the animals in train\/trial pens? Do they ACTUALLY have places to recover and hide between sessions with up to HOW MANY hounds at one time?\nI read the regulations and there are limits set but who enforces these limits? In theory the Ministry does but we know they are not present to see what really goes on. There is a suspicion that there is a lot of cruelty because many of the participants hate coyotes.\nOpening more of these facilities will encourage more of this type of blood sport mentality and more negative attitude towards coyotes. It used to be that wolves were the scourge and were driven out of every place but now they are popular and are being reintroduced all over the world. Times change.\nLetting these old style train and trial pens fade out and looking to replace them with something modern makes more sense. There must be jurisdictions in places like California where cruelty to animals is no longer tolerated. Train\/trial set ups may exist that use AI inspired 'coyotes' to chase.\nWorth looking into for sure before licensing more cruelty.\n",

The innocent wildlife in these facilities are subjected to unimaginable suffering through various methods employed to train dogs for hunting purposes. It is an appalling practice that should never be tolerated.\nThe notion of capturing wild animals from their natural habitats and confining them for the entertainment of hunters is both morally reprehensible and inherently cruel. Using rabbits, coyotes, and foxes as mere pawns for hunters to train their dogs and engage in competitions is an outrageous abuse of power.\nBy considering the opening of applications for train and trial spaces after 25 years, Ontario is taking a massive step backward into a dark and unethical past. These facilities have no place in our society, let alone in our province. It is disheartening to witness such a regressive decision being entertained.\nRather than allowing new applications, it is imperative that the province takes immediate action to close down the existing 24 facilities. This is the only course of action that aligns with compassion, respect for wildlife, and the values of a progressive society.

There are enough scent products available on market to allow for training activies outside of what is being proposed, and training programs exist in the US that take hunters with their dogs out into the woods, teaching the dogs in real environments where wildlife natually exist. Businesses should adapt their model to these regulations, not force the government to re-evaluate cruel exceptions. Such facilities can have property that exists for training, or obtain license to train on crown lands, which have wildlife naturally present without captive presence.\nCompetitions hosted at these facilities can also exist for hunters in the wild giving the animals they hunt a fair chance. To capture them, keep them in captivity only to have them at a terrifying disadvantage and hunted in closed facilities is cruel and unusal, and serves no purpose but human ego.\nWe aren't a society of hunter-gatherers. Hunting exists for sport, which is fine if its a fair hunt; but when wildlife is captive for ego and to make it easier for the hunter, it shouldn't be legal. Saying this is for business when there are alternative business models is a ploy to make their lives easier at the expense of wildlife, which are already losing habitat to urban sprawl (because let's destroy the greenbelt too in the name of housing crisis while not actually changing rules around investment properties).\nWhat grounds are we leaving for wildlife if we take their habitat and then use them in cruel ways for sport; then claim urban populations require protection from wildlife.

In your literature it is stated that you protect natural resources and wildlife.  How does a horrific life of fear and injury \/ death by attack fall under 'protection' of wildlife?  This is what awaits any wildlife used in this terrible 'bait' program - when these operations are discovered with respect to dogs, people go to jail and for good reason.\nPlease review your mandate and take a hard look at the activities that you are planning to endorse.  Most Ontarians want their tax dollars spent on progressive programs that recognize that we live WITH wildlife and need to be better stewards to them and the environment - I think most of us expect this type of leadership from the Ministry - not resurrecting a program that was phased out almost 30 years ago for all good reasons and good riddance.  Why are you pandering to a few man-children who can't think of better activities to spend their time on than killing innocent wildlife?  Are you the Ministry of Hunter Entertainment?\nHunting with dogs should not be condoned - I have seen many a hunter pull up on our sideroad and yank dogs out of wooden boxes - they are often extremely thin - these type of people do not place the welfare of any animal high on their list of priorities.  Any regulations or rules that you may argue will minimize the extremely negative opportunities of this activity do not hold water - we all know that there is no staffing for any kind of monitoring and so do the 'hunters'.\nIn fact I was shocked to learn that there are existing facilities still allowing this type of terrible activity in this day and age.  I think your goal should be to ensure all those license lapse asap.\nYour literature with respect to this proposal states that the impact of this train and trial penning would be neutral or slightly positive.  For who?  Surely not the wildlife condemned to a short miserable life as bait.\nI seriously think the staff at the Ministry should be ashamed of yourselves with regard to even considering this proposal, and I'm sure you are hearing the same thing from many others.\n",

        "comment":"I\u2019m deeply disturbed that Ontario plans to reverse a province-wide ban on new cruel \u201ctrain and trial areas\u201d, where hunters participate in the bloodsport of penned dog hunting.\nOntario passed a law in 1997 to phase out new penned hunting facilities for good reason. Penned hunting is incredibly cruel to the coyotes, foxes, and rabbits who are used as live bait and are chased and killed by packs of dogs. The dogs forced to participate can also suffer from injuries and death.\nIn addition to animal cruelty, penned hunting is a public health risk. The trade and transportation of wildlife is a major contributor to the spread of disease and parasites, including zoonotic diseases that can infect wildlife, domestic animals, and humans.\nResearch is clear: more than four out of five Canadians are against hunting animals for sport. No other Canadian province allows penned dog hunting, and the cruel practice is unlawful in most of the United States.\nPlease do the right thing for animals and public health\u2014don\u2019t undo all of the progress made to phase out penned hunting facilities. Your government should instead focus on strengthening the existing legislation, and shutting down the few remaining train and trial areas in the province.\n",

We should be extending our idea of justice towards them, not a licence to abuse.

By catering to people who want to use their dogs to kill other animals, the government will be signalling a large step away from an idea of justice that includes and values other species. It will increase the belief that hunting with dogs is justified. It isn't. There is no need to terrorize an animal in the time it takes to hunt it down -- or to put the dogs themselves at risk of injury. Some people may still *want* to do it -- but this is not what we should be endorsing, even it is a \"small business opportunity\" (as described by the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters in a letter dated Sept 1, 2020).\nPlease reconsider.

We had the science more than twenty years ago to convince us that this practice was inhumane.\nOwners of such facilities will explain they create 'hideaways' for the prey animals ... That does not suffice. In the end the fox, or rabbit, or coyote (or raccoon, or mink, or badger, or some other creature) is trapped, outnumbered and doomed. We are well aware that any of these creatures suffer the same emotions such experiences would generate in ourselves ... or our children.\nI live in a rural area in a small community. Hunting is a regular pastime here. Some families get the vast majority of their meat that way. They train their dogs - and learn themselves - on the lands they own. That is a very different situation from the one getting promoted in this law change.\nWe should not be setting up hunting ranges with closed in prey - like some real-life simulation game. I am not in support of encouraging such 'sport'. This seems akin to dog-fighting arenas, or cock-fighting operations. If someone is interested in having a hunting dog - and an area to hunt in - then let them bear the cost of the land and the responsibility of sustaining the wildlife populations that live there.

The animals are confined to small pens, deprived of their natural habitat and social interactions, and then released to be chased and killed by hunting dogs. This is a barbaric and inexcusable form of entertainment that has no place in today's world.\nMoreover, the proposed amendments to allow new licenses for these hunting pens demonstrate a complete disregard for the welfare of animals and the environment. Such actions show that the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry is willing to prioritize the interests of a few individuals over the well-being of our wildlife and the future of our ecosystems.\nFurthermore, the hunting industry is not sustainable and does not contribute significantly to the economy or food security. There are more humane and sustainable alternatives to hunting, such as ecotourism, which generates revenue while preserving wildlife and their habitats.\nIn conclusion, I implore the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry to listen to the overwhelming public opposition to these amendments and reject the proposal to allow new licenses for dog hunting pens. It is time for our government to demonstrate true leadership by protecting the welfare of our wildlife and promoting humane and sustainable practices.\n",

When you set dogs on any animal, let alone ones so close in genetics as foxes and coyotes (the 'cousins' of dogs), you are encouraging a blood-lust within them that cannot be reversed, creating an unsafe environment for the wider population, not least due to the type of people that enjoy such brutality.\nSetting dogs on captive animals is morally reprehensible, and completely trashes any notion of fair chase in hunting. These poor animals are either trapped first (foxes and coyotes), so are already likely to be injured, or they are practically tame (rabbits). Hunting dogs also get injured in the fights, and are highly unlikely to receive veterinary treatment.\nSince 1997, no new facilities have been allowed to open. The fact that 24 facilities that were grandfathered are still in existence is shameful. They should have been shut down. To now, 26 years later, actively encourage the creation of more penned dog facilities, and the transfer of existing licences is reprehensible.\nPlease consider how this reflects on Ontario, nationally and internationally.\nThey were phased out for a reason. Our awareness of animal suffering and our impact on the environment has only increased during this time. Why are you regressing?\nEven within the hunting community, only a minority support these facilities. Please do not indulge these people.\nNo animal should have to experience such a terrifying and agonizing death.\nNo amendments. No state-approval of some of the worst cruelty imaginable.\n",

We had the science more than twenty years ago to convince us that this practice was inhumane.\nOwners of such facilities will explain they create 'hideaways' for the prey animals ... That does not suffice. In the end the fox, or rabbit, or coyote (or raccoon, or mink, or badger, or some other creature) is trapped, outnumbered and doomed. We are well aware that any of these creatures suffer the same emotions such experiences would generate in ourselves ... or our children.\nI live in a rural area in a small community. Hunting is a regular pastime here. Some families get the vast majority of their meat that way. They train their dogs - and learn themselves - on the lands they own. That is a very different situation from the one getting promoted in this law change.\nWe should not be setting up hunting ranges with closed in prey - like some real-life simulation game. I am not in support of encouraging such 'sport'. This seems akin to dog-fighting arenas, or cock-fighting operations. If someone is interested in having a hunting dog - and an area to hunt in - then let them bear the cost of the land and the responsibility of sustaining the wildlife populations that live there. Do NOT make it easy for them to simply enjoy this activity as 'sport'.\n",

I was so shocked by this news, I initially thought it was disinformation because the obvious cruelty of this decision seems so extreme that it calls into question the lack of empathy or sanity of the group of people making this decision. This goes against the Ministry's mandate to protect wildlife in favour of catering to a small number of people who seek to perpetuate practices that were previously ended for good reason. Let's not revert positive changes that were made to recognize the value of non-human life and animal welfare.\nI was raised in a family that hunts, I own a dog bred for hunting, I hold a graduate degree in Environmental Science, and I still do not understand the need for these facilities. For dogs bred for hunting, their proficiency at hunting is largely instinctual and does not need to be trained in a pen. From what I can tell, these facilities must only provide either an economic purpose, or entertainment value for people desensitized to their cruelty. This calls to mind images of the Roman Colosseum or wildlife-style Hunger Games -- of spectators watching animals die for fun. How sickening.\nI support hunting and recognize MNRF must balance wildlife populations using hunting as a tool, but to me there is a significant difference between hunting an animal for meat or population management in their natural habitat, and relocating an animal to live the remainder of its life in constant fear with no means of self-preservation. It is unnatural to make predators, namely coyotes, the prey, and MNRF's responsibility is to not interfere with natural ecosystem balance while making management decisions.\nNot only do I strongly reject the proposal to allow for new licenses, I also believe the existing 24 facilities should be closed. It is also my belief that if the public were aware of these facilities prior to recent news, the current facilities would have faced opposition sooner regarding their continued practices.\nThank you.\n",

Who, in their right mind, would keep wild animals penned up without any way of escaping the jaws of an enraged dog? This is absolutely cruel to wild animals and not very Canadian-like at all.\nWhoever dreams up these ideas must be absolutely out of their minds and in need of psychological attention. To put wild animals in harms way ON PURPOSE like this is the most inhumane idea I've ever heard of. It's absolutely appalling!\nWhat with horses dying needlessly at the race track (have you read the news lately?) and the way they are killed needlessly during the chuck wagon races at the Calgary Stampede, surely the Ontario Government can do a lot better than that.\nI'd like to know what PETA and SPCA would have to say about this? Do they even have a voice at all in this case? Well, I think it's time they knew about it.\nI'm hoping that the Province of Ontario would think less about the bottom dollar and consider the feelings of harmless animals for a change. If house cats are allowed to run around free, then why not coyotes, foxes and rabbits, too?! \"Live and let live\" - please don't allow this licensing nonsense to pass by this plea for our wild life's safety and fair treatment.\nThank you!\nT.A.B.\nLondon, ONT\n",

This practice of training dogs with animals bred for this purpose is cruel and inhumane. We should not use animals in this way.\nI have had a number of negative experiences with hunting dogs in rural areas of Ontario. Hunting dogs have nearly killed my domestic pets and have run loose on my property.  Their owners do not always respect the bylaws and are not always able to control the dogs in a way that respects private property.\nOntario Hunting Regulations state: \"Dogs are not permitted to run at large in areas usually inhabited by big game during the closed season. It is your responsibility to ensure your dog does not enter private property that you do not have permission to hunt on or where hunting is prohibited in contravention of the Trespass to Property Act. Hunters are responsible for ensuring their dogs are under their control and that hunting activities are conducted lawfully.\"\nTo train dogs for hunting with live game only creates further opportunities for contravention of hunting laws and antagonistic relationships with rural residents.\nDogs trained to chase live game could potentially injure or even kill a small child.\nIt is horrifying to hear a pack of hunting dogs braying through the forest as they chase down a deer or other game to exhaustion. This is not a respectful way to harvest wild animals.\nI have also been told by the local pound that many dogs are abandoned at the end of the hunting season and have to be caught and euthanized.\nThere are not enough staff available in large hunting areas or Crown Land to monitor and enforce the bylaws that relate to hunting dogs.\nTherefore I oppose any expansion of licensing that allows unleashed dogs to learn how to hunt with captive coyotes, foxes and rabbits.\n",

These animals are intelligent and I don't think it is in line with the moral views of Ontarians to keep them in enclosed areas where they are subject to being hunted by domestic dogs.  I do not support the hunting of wildlife by domestic dogs at all.  I believe hunting practices should be conducted in the the most humane way possible with kills being done by trained humans who are merciful and quick.  Being chased down and mauled by domestic dogs is a horrible death.  Domestic dogs can be trained to aid hunters in tracking or retrieving wildlife.  I do not think they should be actually hunting and killing any wildlife, especially not more intelligent ones such as foxes and coyotes.\nI also don't feel it is ethical to have domestic dogs engage in hunting of other canines for the sake of the domestic dogs.  We do not allow dog fighting of domestic dogs against one another.  I don't think that we should have domestic dogs fighting any canines.\nI don't believe this should ever have been legal in Ontario.  The act meant these licenses to be temporary and I do not agree with extending this activity.  I believe it should be phased out and cease to be legal.\n",

Wildlife should not be removed from their natural environments. Even though the proposal states that the effects will be neutral, this cannot be known for certain. While the populations of the species used as prey seem to be stable at this point in time, it cannot be predicted how this will affect them\/the ecosystems they are found over a longer period of time. On top of this, it is simply cruel to take wildlife from its environment to be used as pawns for training dogs and in competitions. I believe that allowing new licenses for train and trial areas is a step backward for our province. We should be aiming to protect our natural spaces and the organisms that reside in them, and I along with many others will be sorely disappointed with the MNRF if this proposal moves forward.\n",

        "comment":"Recently, I learned from Animal Justice of the Ontario Government's intention to expand on facilities allowing unleashed hunting dogs on penned prey. I had no idea that these facilities existed but I was appalled that they do and the manner in which they are operated.  While these are illegal in most States and in ALL other provinces except Ontario, there is the threat of this horrendous practice expanding here.  This is deplorable.  I protest this development and question who is approving of this.   If the public were aware of such cruelty I do think there would be a strong outcry against them. These after all were to be phased out in a 1997 law.   How is this suddenly acceptable?\nIt is stunning and revolting to me that anyone would refer to unleashing would-be hunting dogs on penned prey and would call that a \u201csport\u201d.   Sport has always implied to me that outcomes are unpredictable with winners and losers.  There is no unpredictability for who are the losers here.  The intentional brutality planned for by this scenario is no less than cruelty to animals.  I was under the mistaken impression that we have laws against this and had no idea we authorized and willingly licensed such cruelty.   That the government would entertain a notion that somehow their licensing would keep this practice from going \u201cunderground\" and that somehow \u201clicensing\u201d makes this  approvable, is quite mystifying.  I fail to see how whether this is licensed or unlicensed there is any way that this is not cruel and inhumane.  The whole premise on which this scheme is founded that the animals are first trapped or ensnared to be put into the pens for their vicious slaughter is horrid.  To have this sanctioned by the government is beyond belief.\nQuite the opposite of expanding the number of licensed premises for this abhorrent activity, a modicum of sportsman-like behaviour would be to ban this altogether and reserve hunting to having the prey with chances of survival.\nI would hope you could consider the outright rejection of this plan.\n",

First they trap the animal, so probably the animal is injured, now the animal is repeatedly chased and if not fast enough, it gets mauled to death by a dog or group of dogs.

As an avid lover of wildlife, owner of hunting dogs,  and volunteer rehabilitator of sick, injured, and orphaned wildlife, I can appreciate the necessary intersections between people, their livelihoods, and the environment. I understand the desire to have high caliber facilities to keep dogs active during the off months  in contained areas. However, I do not believe that this desire should surpass the Ministry\u2019s responsibility to protect wildlife from unnecessary suffering.\nI do believe that additional dog trial facilities would cause undue suffering to the many affected species that contribute to the beauty and diversity of Ontario\u2019s fauna. Confining wildlife to artificial habitats is in direct opposition to the sentiment of keeping wildlife wild. O. Reg. 668\/98, s. 35 (5) of  Conservation Act suggests that wildlife kept in dog trial facilities must have appropriate access to veterinary care or humane euthanasia in the event of injury. I would question the relevance of this suggestion in real life. How many injured animals from these facilities have been subject to veterinary care since 1997? How actively have these facilities been truly monitored for their care of wildlife - is access to veterinary care enforceable or is it a platitude placed in the imaginary event that these individuals would receive care? If facilities that exist now are not appropriately monitored, then how can we place our trust in the Ministry to monitor additional facilities?\nAs a firsthand caregiver for surrendered and seized wildlife victims of baiting I have seen the extent of cruelty and lack of regulation that runs rampant in these facilities. A general goal of hunting and trapping is to make a kill quickly and cleanly to reduce suffering. Any hunter worth their salt should be able to acknowledge that training a dog by handicapping wildlife is a poor excuse for raising a generation of successful hunting dogs. Exposing the same wild individuals to the stress of being hunted repetitively is a poor excuse for maintaining the balance between taking from nature and giving back to nature. I do not stand with the hunters who wish to see an increase in these facilities - who wish to take the easy route by undercutting the treatment of Ontario\u2019s wildlife. I humbly ask that the Ministry acknowledge their responsibility to protect the spirit and intent of hunting and conservation by preventing an increase in licensure for these dated and unnecessary facilities.\n",

The Provincial Government is proposing to expand the number of \u201cpenned dog hunting facilities\u201d licenses  that are allowed in Ontario. Foxes, Coyotes and wild rabbits are put in large wildlife death pens and then a pack of dogs is turned loose to hunt then down. This blood sport is considered entertainment and even have judging matches. This is similar to dog and rooster fighting that has been outlawed in Ontario (PAWS Act section 16) but appears to still legal for wildlife.  This is in the same vein as the English Fox hunt, (which was stopped because it was considered inhumane). The object is to have dogs kill wild animals in a gruesome manner for sport. The idea capturing wildlife put them in a wildlife death pen and then watch them die a terrifying death, is repulsive.\n     The Sporting Dog Association has been lobbing the government along with the support of the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters (spring bear hunt reinstated) to expand this inhumane sport because they claim there is a growing demand.\n    The Harris Government stopped issuing new licenses back in 1997 and would not allow the transfer of them. Ontario has gone from 60 down to 24.\n     Not only should no more licenses be issued, but existing ones should be cancelled. The practice of \u201cpenned dog hunting \u201c(wildlife death pens) is barbaric and inhuman and has to be stopped. No other province in Canada allows this animal torture.\n",

No animal is ours to use, abuse and\/or torture as we wish. They are intelligent and sentient beings who want to live a life free from pain, suffering and death, just like us! So why would you want to reverse and go back on your kind, wise and thoughtful decision made in 1997 to not allow any more of these brutal and cruel \"facilities\" to be allowed to be created anymore when you should instead be acting to immediately close all 24 of these vile facilities that still wrongly exist in the province?!\nPlease remember that a wise man once said, \"a nation can be judged on the way it treats their animals\" and show compassion and empathy for these innocent foxes, coyotes and rabbits by not reversing your wise decision and allowing anymore of this abhorrent \"training areas\" to be created. No one wants and\/or deserves to die a torturous and barbaric death like this, so please do the right thing for all your province's animals and the people who care about them so.\nThank you for your consideration.\nA strong animal lover.\n",

Causing animals to fight each other for human entertainment is an unsavoury exercise that understandably has become an \"*underground* hobby\".  Blood sports like dog and cock fighting, and the training of dogs to kill wildlife, have no place in 21st-century Canada.\nOffering new opportunities for this, and extending the terms of existing licenses, open Ontario to accepting similar repellent practices such as bear-baiting and pig-dogging.  This would be a deplorable development.  A society that claims concern for animal welfare will draw a line at current licenses and allow them to expire as time goes by.  I believe this was the intention of the Harris government that ceased to issue new licenses after 1997.\nIf any action is to be taken to address the existence of wildlife penning areas in Ontario, it should be to close the current areas - for the protection of wildlife and dogs-  not to transfer existing licenses or issue new ones.\nThank you.\n",

Prior to a couple of weeks ago, I had no knowledge of the existence of something so violent. I then watched videos and learned about, yet another act of violence against nonhuman animals, as if there aren\u2019t enough already. The war on coyotes already runs 365 days a year which is horrifying as is that we continue to fail to want to coexist with free living beings. Foxes are often bred and kept on fur farms so they are victims as well in a multitude of ways and now this. Rabbits and hares are small individuals and have literally no chance of escaping, why is the government bending to the hunting community to perpetuate continued violence against sentient beings who have every right to exist, just like you and I. Dogs are victims too in this scenario. The breeding of dogs in general is already a significant issue as it\u2019s exploitive and so unnecessary, but people deliberately go out and buy dogs in what seems like a deliberate choice to use them to become aggressive and perhaps as a \"scapegoat\" to the harmful desire of hunters to kill defenseless being. Dogs have no need to hunt down other beings in no way, shape or form. Many dogs are at risk of euthanasia for behavioural concerns, yet we are putting them in situations where we see a side of them we are digging out for vile purposes. Dogs can be given opportunities for enrichment, exercise and stimulation without making them prey on innocent individuals. The argument that the dogs are \u201cbred for this\u201d is just an excuse to try to justify this horror perpetrated by humans. Stop buying dogs number one and don\u2019t buy dogs who have high prey drives when you are using them to harm other animals. Dogs can be given ways to fulfill instinctual needs without raging a battle against other animals who suffer terribly because the humans seek out power, control and domination over everyone and everything they can get their hands on.\nI truly have no idea what goes on in the minds of government and these decision makers outside of the very dark reality, which is that hunters press the powers that be to bow down to them and their selfish and disturbing demands that continue to harm animals, tear families apart as often coyote and fox kits are left behind when their mothers are caught in traps and used to have dogs tear them to shreds. We are harming the dogs by putting them in horrific situations and run the risk of additional behavioural concerns that could possibly arise as a result of this bloodbath. We are harming and terrifying coyotes, foxes, rabbits and hares for no reason other than satisfying some sort of psychopathic high that very few humans get off of by watching and allowing a sentient being from being heinously brutalized. I\u2019m sure the hunters would not want this to happen to them, but alas, when it is the other way around and free living beings like coyotes get to dogs or humans, the authorities hunt down the animal and mercilessly shoot them dead as they are considered \u201cdangerous\u201d and implement culling. I then ask, a nonhuman animal who lives in the wild, fends for themselves, protects and raises their young and defends themselves is killed for existing and trying to survive yet hunters can do whatever the hell they want and not be considered a danger to society and the beings we share it with, how does that work? There is something very, very wrong with this picture.\nHuman behaviour has a history of  wreaking havoc on the natural world, from feeding free living beings which leads to their demise to forcing dogs on free living beings for no valid or justifiable reason and causing horrific suffering and pain. As a young person who has seen countless instances of humans repeatedly screwing up when it comes to coexisting, respecting and ultimately letting these animals just live their lives, it is gravely concerning and utterly hopeless that those who should be working at protecting, conserving and doing better \u2013 we continue to take decades worth of steps backwards and failing again and again to truly evolve.\n",

A bit like blood sport at the Roman Colosseum, re-branded as a training exercise.\nWhat challenge can there be to kill prey that cannot escape? This is on a par with dog fighting in terms of its cruelty. What\u2019s that old saw? Like shooting fish in a barrel? Except it would be far more compassionate to shoot the prey than to be ripped limb from limb by a pack of bloodthirsty dogs.\nThere is little doubt that this is a form of entertainment, a blood sport rather than training. I\u2019m quite sure that bets will be placed upon various aspects, including time of death and length of the hunt. Remember that there are lots of hunters willing to leave behind their \u201cbeloved best friends\u201d at the end of hunting season every year if the dog isn\u2019t there to leave when they are.\nThey\u2019re disposable.\nWho will police these hunters in terms of regulations? Safety pods? 90 days to apply is much too long, how many new facilities do you think will spring up?\nThis is a regressive plan, out of step with civilized society. We do not allow any kind of training or experimentation on humans if it poses a serious risk to a person. How can we, as humans, be so entitled, arrogant and convinced of our superiority over other species that we allow people to engage in this slaughter?\nRemember when science admonished us all not to ascribe human emotions to animals? Not to anthropomorphize them? Its clear to us now that they do experience emotion. We are only now beginning to understand the depth of intellect of other species. That\u2019s our lack, not theirs. So its ok to watch as they are ripped apart with no chance of escape?  My god, the terror they must feel when they realize there is no way out, and what a painful death. To what end? It certainly cannot be hunting for food. It\u2019s trophy hunting with the mangled, bloody corpse of a wild animal as the prize. Now THATS entertainment!\nI read one official stating that \u201cthere is a growing demand\u201d and without allowing it, then it will move underground and cause harm. I\u2019d like you to openly publish your data on this eventuality from other places that have banned it completely already. I bet it doesn\u2019t exist, I call horse crap.\nA civilized society would not allow the proliferation of such barbarism, would it? Is Ontario a civil society?\nI sure hope we can be.\n",

The thought of enclosing wild animals to be cruelly hunted and killed by dogs makes me sick. Have we reverted to another time?? It is 2023, and the vast majority of people in this province are against animal cruelty in all forms. There is no need for hunting dogs in my opinion, even if there is some pathetic attempt to frame this as something that we need (due to some argument regarding \"them\" being problematic). Rabbits, foxes, coyotes and other wild animal deserve our respect (as part of the larger essential eco-system) and our compassion, as we continue to encroach and destroy their habitat.  There are always more humane ways to deal with any over growth of an animal population. I implore you to reject this revolting amendment and show the citizens of this Province that we respect all forms of wildlife.

It is almost unbelievable that this an issue even up for consultation.  How can it be legal in this day and age to allow such a barbaric practice where foxes, coyotes and rabbits are penned in and 'hunted' with no where to go and in the end are torn to pieces by dogs being 'trained' in this matter.   What a terrifying death these poor animals would suffer.  Even the way they would come to these facilities is inhumane- caught by trappers and sold off to these facilities that are essentially houses of horror.\nOntario would be the ONLY province allowing this cruelty to go on.  It is a practice so barbaric that even most of the states have outlawed it.  I am ashamed to be associated with a province that is now considering this notion that will cause unnecessary suffering to so many.\nI am asking with the utmost urgency that the ban on penned hunting stay in place and also that any currently open be immediately shut down.\nI know animals aren't voters so they aren't at the top of most politician's lists, but I ask you all to look into your hearts and think with courage and compassion to protect all those who can't speak for themselves.  This is something you all could do that would save thousands of animals a horrifying death. What an important legacy that would be!\nI will be watching this issue very closely and will never vote for this party again if the ban does not remain in place.\nThank you for your consideration on this matter.\n",

Having these places is just straight up wrong. You are taking wild animals out of their natural habit and causing them pain and grief. Not only are you removing them from their homes, but you are causing them stress, fear and anxiety as they race for their lives against hunting dogs. This not only is very inhuman, but it also disturbs the balance in the natural environment. We are already taking so many of these innocent animals lives by our roads and buildings, but now we must also take their lives unnecessarily? You are causing these animals pain beyond pain, and stress enough to kill them. I always thought that Ontario was a good, stong and humane probinc, and I was proud to be a part of that. But now I have learned the truth. Ontario is heartless and cares nothing of the natural environment. Please prove me wrong. Do what is right and not only continue to have it against the law to make new trail and train facilities, but shut down the current ones as well.\nA hopeful member of Ontario\n",

The proposed goal is not a compelling one; just so that the dogs become accustomed to tracking wildlife for hunting as a sport\/recreational activity and for hunting competitions? That is not an outcome necessary enough to justify the obvious inhumane treatment of the captive animals - who have no quality of life or chance at escape. Captive foxes suffer in captivity ( https:\/\/montreal.ctvnews.ca\/opinion-a-call-to-end-fur-farms-and-stop-cr\u2026 ). Why would it be any more acceptable to torment them for training dogs for sport than it is for fur farming?\nIt would not be considered acceptable for farmed animals to be routinely subjected to stress and cruelty before slaughter for food. Why then would that be acceptable to subject wildlife to? The foxes, coyotes and rabbits are not even being hunted to feed hungry humans - merely as 'recreation'. There are other things that dogs can be trained to do that would be far more useful and even noteworthy - ex. track and rescue ( https:\/\/canadiansearchdog.com\/training\/training-your-dog-to-search.html , https:\/\/osarva.ca\/k9\/ https:\/\/www.ovsarda.on.ca\/ https:\/\/downsviewvethospital.com\/news\/search-and-rescue-dogs ).\nWith good reason, in 1997 the decision was made not to allow any more of these facilities to be created. It was a former Conservative government who started the phase out. There can be no new compelling reason strong enough to make it suddenly more ethical or acceptable now - 26 years later, to continue to trap and keep wildlife captive in enclosed pens only so that hunters can train dogs to hunt and to run 'competitions' for hunting dogs.There is no ethical or moral reason that can justify why these facilities should continue to operate, much less to continue to exist.\nI strongly oppose the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry\u2019s proposal to allow any new licenses to operate these penned dog hunting facilites, and to allow the transfer of existing licenses, for dog train and trial areas in Ontario. As a taxpayer and voter in Ontario I urge you this government to reject this proposal and refuse to give it force in law or policy.\nPenned dog hunting facilities are very clearly by design and nature extremely cruel, inhumane and unacceptable treatment of the wild animals kept captive and then hunted where they have no 'sporting' chance whatsoever. The animals that will be exploited in this proposal are fellow creatures who play important integral parts in the ecosystem we are also a part of, and deserve to be treated with respect and care as conscious living beings who deserve to exist and not be exploited or tormented - they are not merely inanimate 'resources' to be callously used, abused and killed. Have we not come to realize that nature is not ours to exploit at will?\nHunting does not control coyote and fox populations ( ex. https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2019\/06\/14\/730056855\/killing-coyotes-is-not-as-effe\u2026 , https:\/\/www.humanesociety.org\/resources\/why-killing-coyotes-doesnt-work ,  https:\/\/www.scientificamerican.com\/article\/why-killing-coyotes-doesn-rs\u2026, ). \".Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry research scientist Brent Patterson said he\u2019s studied wolves and coyotes extensively over the last 15 years, including control methods. The short answer on bounties is they don\u2019t work. It wasn\u2019t for lack of trying; records show that Ontario spent the equivalent of $850,000 in today\u2019s dollars on its coyote bounty back in 1918, he said.....\" So there is no compelling reason to train dogs to hunt them.\" ( https:\/\/farmersforum.com\/coyotes-a-problem-but-a-bounty-isnt-the-answer\u2026 'Coyotes a problem but a bounty isn\u2019t the answer says researcher' June 01, 2018, Farmers Forum 'The largest circulation farm newspaper in Ontario, Canada' ), https:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/canada\/edmonton\/bounties-on-wolves-and-coyotes-\u2026\nBy Connor Lynch ).\nThe trapping involved will undoubtedly also catch other species of animals that are not coyotes, rabbits, or foxes - including potentially protected or endangered species, and domestic animals such as dogs. The argument that otherwise this activity would 'move underground' is without merit. If it were true, then that implies that the majority of those training hunting dogs or entering competitions for sport are otherwise willing to participate in illegal activities. That doesn't sound like 'sport'. Making it legal to do this does not make it acceptable.\nThis 'sport' can attract illegal and illicit activity, and there is the question of the methods used and treatment of the dogs being 'trained'; i.e. \"...Dogs used to chase down canids are equipped with GPS and shock collars while their handlers track the dogs from their vehicles. ..\".. ) https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/TCCEinc\/ ). And environmental, health and legal concerns;\nPenning wildlife and forcing wildlife into contact with humans and domestic animals such as dogs can foster and spread disease and parasites to humans, dogs, coyotes, foxes, and other wildlife; for ex. see growing concern about Echinococcus multilocularis Infection - present and growing in Southern Ontario, according to the US CDC; \".typically fatal in humans and dogs when left untreated. Since 2012, alveolar echinococcosis has been diagnosed in 5 dogs, 3 lemurs, and 1 chipmunk in southern Ontario, Canada, a region previously considered free of these tapeworms.\"...\"...In humans and dogs, AE is typically fatal when left untreated. The E. multilocularis tapeworm has a wide distribution in the Northern Hemisphere, including extensive endemic regions in North America, Europe, and Asia (1), and is usually maintained in a life cycle that involves 2 mammalian hosts. Wild canids (e.g., foxes and coyotes), dogs, and (less commonly) cats act as definitive hosts, which harbor adult parasites in the small intestine without apparent clinical disease.....\"......\nhttps:\/\/wwwnc.cdc.gov\/eid\/article\/25\/2\/18-0299_article . We have barely been able to fight off one pandemic - likely caused by the farming, penning and harvesting of wild animals and increased human contact with wildlife is a recipe for another disastrous but entirely foreseeable zoonoses https:\/\/www.who.int\/news-room\/fact-sheets\/detail\/zoonoses https:\/\/www.hsi.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/HSI-white-paper-on-fur-p\u2026 .\nI do not believe that you will find a majority of current mainstream veterinarians or animal specialists or biologists who would agree that this proposal has any ethical merit whatsoever.  One employed or speaking for a special interest hunting group - has an inherent conflict of interest.\nPlease do the right, the humane, the ethical and the scientifically informed thing and turn down the MNR's proposal, and phase out these trap and train facilities entirely, asap.\nSincerely,\nAn Ontario taxpayer, resident and voter.\n",

Dogs trained to hunt captive or non-captive prey for sport is outdated. Quite simply it is cruelty towards animals and should be banned. Fox hunting and bullfighting have been banned for the same reason. Hounds chasing and\/or hunting hare, fox and coyotes is no different.\nAn argument has been made that if these areas are not legalized then the activity would be driven underground. This is completely flawed. Put more effort into stopping this unlawful activity.\nA small special interest group should not get permission to do this. It is completely inhumane.

I see nothing in this proposal that will ensure the humane treatment of either dogs or wildlife.  I was a resident of rural Eastern Ontario for over 30 years and was appalled at the condition of hunting dogs that traversed our property during hunting season.  Malnourished dogs, with no recall showed up many times in the fall, often terrorizing our family livestock and pets, to say nothing of our children.  There is nothing in this proposal that will ensure all hunters will properly train their animals, let alone maintain them in a good healthy state.  we already have here in Frontenac County a case of a man who abandons his dogs when they no longer suit him. He was not identified by any of his hunting friends, despite local common knowledge that he engaged in these practices.  I do not see the need for the government to encourage hunting with dogs when they are not enforcing any standards on their usage.\nI am also opposed to the running of packs of dogs in confined areas where animals have no escape.  I have witnessed the carnage and destruction when these dogs descend on a prey animal.  This is major cruelty and I do not support any government attempt to promote this.  I grew up in a family of hunters with a strong ethic for responsible hunting practices.

Please do NOT implement these.\nThe Ontario government\u2019s plan to reverse a province-wide ban on new cruel \u201ctrain and trial areas\u201d where hunters participate in the bloodsport of penned dog hunting is utterly barbaric and will make Ontario a pariah in the national and international communities.\nNo other Canadian province allows penned dog hunting, and the shocking practice is unlawful in most of the United States.\nOntario passed a law in 1997 to phase out new penned hunting facilities for important reasons. Penned hunting is incredibly cruel to the coyotes, foxes, and rabbits who are used as live bait.\nIn penned dog hunting, terrified foxes, coyotes, and rabbits run for their lives, but have nowhere to escape to. When caught, they're are often viciously killed by dogs who are trained to rip them apart, piece by piece.\nThe dogs forced to participate can also suffer from injuries and death.\nThe animals used as bait are usually caught by trappers and sold to be released into these pens and hunted to death. Sometimes, these animals are bred so their offspring can be used in captive hunts.\nA large majority of Canadians are against hunting animals for sport. Valid research (https:\/\/researchco.ca\/2022\/04\/08\/animals-canada-2\/) shows that more than four out of five Canadians are against it.\nPenned hunting is also a public health risk. The trade and transportation of wildlife is a major contributor to the spread of disease and parasites, including zoonotic diseases that can infect wildlife, domestic animals, and humans.\nPlease leave the ban on penned hunting in place and shut down any remaining train and trial areas in Ontario.\n",

This means that their quality of life is negatively impacted as is their survival and ability to engage in natural behaviours.\nLicensing these training facilities is to sanction animal cruelty. If pet dogs or cats were the victims used to train hunters it would be clear that this is unacceptable. Yet, the wildlife that is intended to be the victim of this training feel the same amounts of terror, pain, and other suffering as a pet dog or cat.\nAs the current licenses expire the training facilities need to be shut down.\nAt the same time - your government should be looking at the cruel practice that is common in Ontario - leaving hunting dogs chained to dog houses in all weather, without the opportunity to play or socialize. Tethering has been banned in many civilized areas (e.g., New York State) and should be banned in Ontario, along with the practice of keeping these dogs isolated from others of their species and from human contact. There is plenty of evidence that dogs traditionally used for hunting and kept in these deplorable conditions are as loving and friendly as any other dog!\n",

They need to be left alone to live in the wild.  We, as humans need to appreciate that they have a right to an existence in the wild.  We need to learn to co-exist with them, and to support their lives by whatever means we can.  They have a right to be on this planet, just as we do.  The very act of capturing them would be terrifying to each and every one of them.  Ask a prisoner of war how it feels to be captured.\n\u2022\tThen they are set up as pawns for hunters to train and hold competitions, only to be tortured and die a cruel death.  This reminds me of bullfights in Spain, or throwing Christians to the lions in Ancient Rome.  And yet here we are in 2023.\nInstead of opening new applications, the province\u2019s existing 24 facilities need to be closed immediately.  Why is the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry concerned about hunters\u2019 requests?  Shouldn\u2019t the Ministry be concerned about protecting wildlife, not torturing it?\nI am sure that if you took a poll of Ontarians, that 98% would not be in favour of these proposed changes.

Sometimes these animals are bred to die, in that their offspring can be used in these captive hunts.\nThe hunting dogs -- forced to participate in such violent activities -- also can, and do, suffer from injuries and death. It's not right. It's cruel.\nA large majority of Canadians are against hunting animals for sport, as research shows that more than 4 out of 5 Canadians are against it. Also, no other Canadian province allows penned dog hunting; and it's illegal in most of the United States. Why would Ontario want to overturn a ban on this type of abominable animal cruelty?

I'm all for hunting but this goes beyond. How many wild animals will be used? Will it be regulated? At what point does the profit of this and the impact of the wildlife population become grossly disproportionate? If humanity has shown me anything it will run these population to near extinct just for the money. I will use the situation with sealife as an example these are protected creatures and nearly extinct so I can only imagine what will become of animals that are not protected.\n",

Ontario passed a law in 1997 to phase out new penned hunting facilities for important reasons. It's cruel to the coyotes, foxes, and rabbits who are used as live bait. Terrified foxes, coyotes, and rabbits run for their lives, but have nowhere to escape to. When caught, they're often viciously killed by dogs who are trained to rip them apart, piece by piece. The dogs forced to participate can also suffer from injuries and death. The animals used as bait are usually caught by trappers and sold to be released into these pens and hunted to death. Sometimes, these animals are bred so their offspring can be used in captive hunts.\nA large majority of Canadians are against hunting animals for sport. This research shows that more than four out of five Canadians are against it. No other Canadian province allows penned dog hunting, and the shocking practice is unlawful in most of the United States.\nPenned hunting is also a public health risk. The trade and transportation of wildlife is a major contributor to the spread of disease and parasites, including zoonotic diseases that can infect wildlife, domestic animals, and humans.\n",

It was concluded 25 years ago, under Mike Harris, that penned dog hunting facilities are inhumane, cruel to wildlife and that the best approach to handle the situation was to stop selling new licenses so that existing operators could get out of the business with minimal costs.\nThe majority of the population does not live rurally and wants to see the wildlife in the province treated respectfully. Those who live rurally generally want hunting to maintain its cultural significance. Having come from a long line of hunters and humane trappers, the idea of capturing wildlife to make it easier to hunt is completely repugnant to me. If a hunter is so lazy that he or she cannot go out into the woods with a dog to practice and develop the necessary skills, then they should not be hunting in the first place. These weekend warriors want the feel good aspect of hunting with none of the work. This is just irresponsible wildlife management promoting all the negative aspects of gun culture and not land stewardship.\nI would like to see the government do the right thing and flush this proposal back into the sewage tank from which it was dredged.\n",

Allowing new licenses for dog train and trial facilities would be a huge step backward in a civilized, tolerant and humane society. It will require tax dollars (that could be better used elsewhere) to enforce regulations and monitor compliance while providing negligible economic benefit to Ontarians. And it will result in further polarization of views between those who support legitimate, ethical hunting and those who oppose all hunting.\nThe intent was that these facilities would be phased-out over time, following the last approvals in 1997. Instead of allowing new applications, the province\u2019s existing 24 facilities need to be allowed to close as current licensees retire or move on to other pursuits. Until they close due to natural progression, these facilities should be restricted to the use of dead furred animals and scent for training and trials.\nIt is cruel and inhumane to use live animals to train or exercise dogs. Wildlife naturally exists in a constant struggle of life and death, either in pursuit of, or becoming, prey. However, the distress and suffering experienced by captive rabbits, foxes and coyotes as they are being pursued by a predator purely for amusement or \u201cenjoyment\u201d (of humans or the dogs) is not justifiable in an isolated event, much less so in multiple, repeated events as would take place in train and trial facilities.\nFurthermore, taking wild animals from the natural environment into captivity for the purpose of being used as live bait runs contrary to ethical hunting practices. As a hunter, I am clearly not opposed to hunting but insist on abiding by ethical practices. Ethical hunting dictates that we, as hunters, are respectful of the animals we are hunting, are skilled enough to prevent undue suffering and always practice fair chase. Regardless of enclosure size, the repeated harassment of wildlife is unjustifiable, unethical and will only result in further stigmatization of even ethical hunters by anti-hunting members of society.\nUnder Ontario\u2019s FWCA it is illegal to allow a dog to be running loose in an area inhabited by deer, moose or elk during closed season out of concern for the welfare of the wildlife. There are no prohibitions on winter training\/trialing. I fail to see a logical reason why this concern for animal welfare under the hardship of winter conditions does not extend to rabbits, coyote and fox that are permitted to be held in training facilities.\nHunting requires skill, maturity, respect, and responsibility. Unfortunately, using dogs for anything beyond retrieving or recovering game does not meet these criteria. While training a dog to hunt requires dedication and skill, the use of live wildlife as bait in training, or actively hunting wildlife, at any time of year using dogs is neither respectful nor responsible; it is a practice that belongs in history books, as evidenced by the number of states and countries worldwide that have banned hunting with dogs. I would like to see MNRF reject this proposal and instead support only ethical hunting (and dog training) practices.\n",

Upon further research it is clear the Premier Harris acted correctly in 1997 in phasing out penned dog hunting facilities, balancing the need to advance into the future while respecting the livelihood of existing facility owners. After a quarter of a century three-quarters of the facilities were phased out, and the remainder are likely to go within a decade or two.\nThis is not a practice in keeping with Canadian norms and values.  All other wildlife practices work to minimize animal terror and suffering, with an emphasis on humane and necessary culls, animal control and wildlife management. This practice does not align with that ethos.\nPenned dog hunting is a relic from a time gone by. The fact that tens of thousands of hunters may wish this to be re-energized must be weighed against the wishes of ten million Ontarians.The fact that these hunters are pursuing a vested interest and that the ten million are not quite as aware of this activity should not be misconstrued as general support. More work needs to be done by the government of Ontario to understand the values of its citizens on this issue as opposed to being led by a small interest group.\nI am opposed to this proposal then for two reasons. First, I personally do not see it as in keeping with either Canadian or Ontarian values. Second, it has not had the wide spread public and political discussion required for such a reversal of government policy.\n",

Many countries have banned the abuse of animals for sport or entertainment and we should stand amongst them.  The stress that these sentient beings are put through is severe and cruel.\n-\tThe proposal mentions that these species have sustainable populations and there are no concerns with limited take of small numbers but inflicting pain is not a proper way to manage animal populations and this activity should definitively not be a proper one for training dogs.\n-\tPenned dog hunting may also contribute to public health risk by helping the spread of diseases from trapped wild animals to domestic ones and humans even though they are in confined areas.\n-\tThis is a highly barbaric practice and since the ban was implemented for important reasons it should remain as such.

        "comment":"Why I Oppose at least Part of Bill 91: I just oppose cruelty.\nSchedule 14 of Bill 91, Less Red Tape, Stronger Economy Act, 2023 defines train and trial areas as:\n\u201ctrain and trial area\u201d means an area in which wildlife is enclosed for the purpose of teaching dogs hunting skills or testing their hunting skills;\n\u201ctrial\u201d means a competition in a train and trial area that tests the skills of dogs to hunt wildlife by scent.\nO. Reg. 668\/98, s. 28.\nDogfighting \u2013 the \u201csport\u201d of pitting one dog against another to fight to the death \u2013 has been illegal in Canada since 1892. But it never entirely went away.  The Ontario government under Premier Doug Ford is now poised to enshrine another form of dogfighting by expanding train and trail compounds that pit hunting dogs against coyotes, foxes, hares, and cottontails. In 1997, Ontario Premier Mike Harris chose to phase out the last vestige of this brutal treatment of canines. Current Premier Doug Ford intends to reverse the Harris decision.\nThe target of Harris\u2019s legislation was not called \u201cdogfighting,\u201d (already illegal) but \u201ctrain and trial\u201d which was conducted in approximately fifty or sixty facilities in the province at the time. Existing facilities could continue, but with no more to be added or the business licenses of those already operating allowed to be transferred. It would slowly end by attrition.\nBut now current Ontario Premier Doug Ford seeks to accommodate \u201chunters\u201d who already violate the law to run dogs after our wildlife on private and public land.  But by every measure train and trial activities are analogous to dogfighting.\nThe Navajo people of the southwestern U.S. were not far off the mark in calling the coyote \u201cGod\u2019s dog\u201d, nor were the early colonists who called the coyote the \u201cburrowing dog.\u201d To a naturalist like me, with an interest in evolution, zoological taxonomy and nomenclature, the distinction between the coyote (Canis latrens), the wolf (Canis lupus) and the dog (Canis lupus familiaris, or Canis familiaris) is a matter of degree derived from very ancient times when there was no distinction among the three types. All have a common ancestor.\nAbout two million years ago one group started to \u201cdiverge\u201d from that common ancestor, to evolve into two types we now call wolves and coyotes. Much later, about 19,700 to 26,000 years ago, our very distant ancestors in Eurasia selectively bred some of the wolves into what was to become the tail-wagging animal now found in so many homes \u2013 the dog.\nArguably these divisions never reached the point where we had three distinct species as the species concept is defined \u2013 that is, a group of organisms that interbreed to produce fertile young, and are more alike each other than like other organisms.\nAll three of these members of the genus, Canis, can interbreed to produce viable (fertile) young, which is why some scientists now consider the dog, at least, to be a subspecies (a definable population within a species who resemble each other more than the rest of the species) of the wolf.\nReally they are all \u201cdogs\u201d, in the same way that African elephants and Asian elephants are both elephants, or lions, leopards and lynx are all cats.\nBut what Mr. Ford is intending to inflict on \u201cwild dogs\u201d most Ontarians would never, ever, want to have done to their family companion at the end of the leash.\nI hate cruelty. All species of \u201cdog\u201d are so much more similar than dissimilar, and what abuses dogs also abuses coyotes, or foxes, or rabbits. We are all cognitive beings, with central nervous systems and pain sensors, thus self interests. No one of any species wants to be torn apart however fun it may be for others to watch.\nThat is why I stand so strongly against this proposal to reverse a worldwide trend toward more compassion for animals, and the repeal of 26 year-old legislation Harris enacted by allowing new \u201ctrain and trial\u201d compounds to be established in the province.\nThe compounds are large pens where dogs can be trained to follow the scent of wild foxes, coyotes, or rabbits, either for training or competition. The idea is for the prey, although confined by fencing, to escape capture by finding refuge provided by the proprietor of the facility. No matter how traumatized the \u201cgame\u201d may be, they are not expected to be killed upon reaching shelter in time and if the dogs cannot enter that shelter. Otherwise, a fight occurs, a dog fight in the case of the coyote. Foxes can\u2019t put up as much of a defence as coyotes, and bunnies not at all. The foxes are purchased from trappers or from fur farms while rabbits \u2013 varying hares or eastern cottontails \u2013 are obtained by whatever means are sanctioned by the government. Some may find such barbarity acceptable but most of us do not.\nThe dogs are themselves at risk of injury when fighting coyotes and possibly even foxes, as well. Just as too many coyote hunters happily let their dogs chase wildlife on private and public land now, permission be damned, so they did when there were more compounds, as rural landowners told me back then. This a version of the old, ritual-burdened English tradition of fox-hunting, tally-ho! now illegal in England, and here, and most places.\nWhile increasing numbers of us enjoy nature-based activities, only about 17 percent of Canadians are involved in consumptive wildlife use, such as hunting, and the trajectory society is following is toward ever-increasing concern for the welfare of others, including other species. As a diminishing demographic, the hunting community seeks common ground with the rest of us, by connecting hunting to conservation, utilization, fair chase, and the minimization of cruelty. Dog training and trialing compounds have nothing to do with any of that. But possibly some (I trust not most) more ethical hunters understandably believe that the enemy of my enemy is my friend, thus the support Premier Ford depends upon from the majority of hunters who hunt legally within ethical boundaries. The hunters fear no greater enemy than the dreaded \u201cantis\u201d, the anti-hunters who, right or wrong, oppose killing for sport. And so, they seek rationalizing the \u201csport\u201d on the bases of those common interests \u2013 conservation, fair chase, quick killing, and utilization, and turn a blind eye to the slob hunters within their ranks to make common cause. For now, everyone who wants to kill wildlife who, technically, belongs to us all, whether we approve or not, and however the wildlife is to be killed, whether consumed or not, fairly chased or not, have an opportunistic champion in a high place, by the name of Doug Ford.\nI recommend that Schedule 14 be amended to allow train and trial compounds to be used by dogs for scenting only.  No wild animals.  No cruelty.  No killing.\n",

Industrial areas would be healthier than pens. My Mafia upbringing and fervent Gnosticism tell me: if no masturbation, then no sin.

I firmly reject the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry\u2019s proposal to allow new licenses and the transfer of licenses for train and trial areas in Ontario.\nOntario passed a law in 1997 to phase out new penned hunting facilities for good reason. Penned hunting is incredibly cruel to the coyotes, foxes, and rabbits who are used as live bait and are chased and killed by packs of dogs. The dogs forced to participate can also suffer from injuries and death.\nIn addition to animal cruelty, penned hunting is a public health risk. The trade and transportation of wildlife is a major contributor to the spread of disease and parasites, including zoonotic diseases that can infect wildlife, domestic animals, and humans.\nResearch is clear: more than four out of five Canadians are against hunting animals for sport. No other Canadian province allows penned dog hunting, and the cruel practice is unlawful in most of the United States.\nPlease do the right thing for animals and public health\u2014don\u2019t undo all of the progress made to phase out penned hunting facilities.

The act of trapping a wild animal causes both psychological and physical trauma. All wild animals experience a heightened state of stress when restrained, and putting them through this harmful process to then be confined as a dog training tool is extremely primitive. We would never allow a similar practice if it involved domestic species being the training tool, so why should it be any different with wildlife? All animals are sentient beings with the capacity to feel pain, fear, and stress. This leads to decreased health and it lowers the quality of life that every animal deserves.\nOnce confined to a pen, a wild animal is no longer able to exhibit their natural behaviours such as breeding, socializing, foraging, and creating a suitable home. Taking this away deprives them of everything they know. Wild animals each have an important ecological role to play as well. It\u2019s true that the species used in this practice (the cottontail, snowshoe hare, fox, and coyote) are stable in population numbers, however that does not mean that they should be treated as a resource to be exploited and used essentially as a toy. They should have the freedom to fulfill their natural life in the wild.\nThe proposal to grow this practice in Ontario is incredibly disheartening, and is a severe setback for animal welfare. I understand that some humans enjoy hunting as a leisurely activity but the train and trial method is inflicting unnecessary harm on sentient beings. Hunting dogs do not need to train with live prey. Please take a moment to consider the well-being of the wildlife, just as we consider the well-being of our domestic animals at home. A life is a life no matter the species.\nKind regards.\n",

        "comment":"I was shocked and upset to see the Ontario government considering allowing new cruel \"train and trial areas\" where hunters participate in the bloodsport of penned dog hunting.\nOntario passed a law in 1997 to phase out new penned hunting facilities for important reasons. Penned hunting is incredibly cruel to the coyotes, foxes, and rabbits who are used as live bait. In penned dog hunting, terrified foxes, coyotes, and rabbits run for their lives, but have nowhere to escape to. When caught, they're are often viciously killed by dogs who are trained to rip them apart, piece by piece.\nThe dogs forced to participate can also suffer from injuries and death. The animals used as bait are usually caught by trappers and sold to be released into these pens and hunted to death. Sometimes, these animals are bred so their offspring can be used in captive hunts.\nA large majority of Canadians are against hunting animals for sport. This research shows that more than four out of five Canadians are against it. No other Canadian province allows penned dog hunting, and the shocking practice is unlawful in most of the United States.\nPenned hunting is also a public health risk. The trade and transportation of wildlife is a major contributor to the spread of disease and parasites, including zoonotic diseases that can infect wildlife, domestic animals, and humans.\nPlease leave the ban on penned hunting in place and shut down any remaining train and trial areas in Ontario.\nA society is only as good as is its treatment of animals.\n",

The  majority in ontario do not want to see dogs used to harass and maime wildlife. It is unfair to be removing wildlife that others enjoy and value  for the purpose of a blood sport.  The other issue is that there is very little money for enforcement or policing to ensure the animals being used are  caught on legal trap lines. I know personally of a hunter that lives across the road . He  has hunting dogs and is catching animals on private farmland.  There is not enough funding for enforcement to  police what he does.\nIt is very likely that coyotes and foxes  that are valued for there vermin control capabilities on my farm are being trapped  . Just to see these animals kept in a filthy dark barn terrified waiting to be torn apart makes me wonder why this proposal is being put forward.  It is simply encouraging this behaviour.There is no policing or enforcement to monitor how the trapped animals are being held. The vast majority of people want to enjoy the outdoors and the wildlife not be thinking that the coyote they have eating all the vermin and controlling pests on there farm is being trapped to use as bait for what is ultimately someones cruel entertainment.\nInstead of opening new applications, the province\u2019s existing 24 facilities need to be closed immediately.\n",

        "comment":"Hunting Animals on Private Property for sport.\nFirstly, this is not sport - it is cruelty to a coyote, rabbit or any other animal involved, and CANNOT AND SHOULD NOT BE EXPANDED.\nTrapping an animal that can be maimed in this process, then introducing it to humans, and putting it in a penned enclosure for a pack of dogs cannot be classed as \"sport\".  The outcome is known from the start - the animal is going to be torn apart and killed.\nOnce a dog has tasted blood, they will attack again.  Even though this is on private property, there will be children envolved who see this and \"learn\" it is okay to treat an animal this way, which could lead to other issures in how they treat humans.\nHave we not done enough to our wildlife by eliminating a large part of their habit.  We are losing birds and wild animals every day.  Isn't it time we do something positive.\nIf it is truly for sport these dogs can hunt for an object, which can be hidden on the properties, just like the duck retrieving trials (they use decoys).  There is no need to take the life of a coyote just so a group\nof people that want to enagage in this activity to see the gory site of a wild animal being torn to piecers\nby a pack of dogs in a frenzy. Once a dog gets the taste of blood it is hard to keep them from killing again.\nTHIS TYPE OF ACTIVITY SHOULD BE ELIMINATED NOT EXPANDED.  It is right up there with COCK FIGHTING, and DOG FIGHTING.  THE ANIMALS ARE KILLED FOR THE MONETARY REWARD AND THE\nHIGH OR SATISFACTION OF THE PEOPLE THAT ENGAGE AT ANY LEVEL IN THESE ACTIVITIES.\nTo be lucky enough to see a wild animal in their natural environment is a wonderful and beautiful site,and I have seen a few as I live in the country.  All of these animals perform a function in the balance\nof nature, and we have enfringed on their habitat.  IS IT NOT TIME WE THINK OF POSITIVE WAYS TO PRESERVE NATURE, INSTEAD OF DESTROYING IT?\n",

Even if they have proper food, water, cleanliness and accommodation while enclosed, they are subjected to extreme fear which is emotional abuse in spite of the fact that this occurs in their natural environment with predators.

        "comment":"As an active participant of dog trails in Ontario, I support the amendment of the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act, 1997, and associated regulations to allow for the issuance of licences of new dog train and trial areas, and to allow the transfer of licences.\nThere are currently only a handful of licenced pens that I can travel to in Ontario, most of which are over 200 km away from my home. I more often travel to the USA where, due to their lack of barriers in licencing such as those currently in Ontario, are more accessible.  I can\u2019t help but note the small boost in local economies that this amendment would provide.\nIt is my experience that professional dog trainers and owners alike are greatly concerned about environmental sustainability and animal welfare.  It is in our best interest to maintain healthy game populations and optimal conditioning of these animals to allow our dogs to hunt fairly.\nOn a grander scale, the preservation of land in its natural state would undeniably result in a positive impact and offset carbon emissions.\nParticipants in this sport are part of a niche group. I don\u2019t expect the impact of this amendment to be colossal or cause any harm once so ever to environmental or animal welfare.\n",

Dogs are trained in these facilities how to kill coyotes and foxes with their teeth. Outside of these facilities\/pens, in the natural environment, multiple dogs at a time are let loose to track and chase down a  coyote or fox. The dog behaviour is learned in these training facilities\/pens how to track, attack and kill coyotes and foxes. Dogs pursue by running a canid to exhaustion and often viciously mauling them to death.\nTrappers can live trap a fox or coyote and sell them to these barbaric pen facilities 365 days a year.\n\"Hounders\" (dog handlers with guns) may shoot the fleeing canid in the side or hip area (these \"rot shots\" are meant to injure not kill) which causes immense suffering and a blood trail for the dogs in pursuit. Individuals may incite attacks on injured animals as well once the fox\/coyote is caught and is surrounded by the dogs. Dogs used to chase down canids are equipped with GPS and shock collars while their handlers track the dogs from their vehicles. Another approach is for the dog handlers to stand along roadways with their weapons waiting for the dogs to flush out the fleeing coyote or fox.\nRabbits are also kept in smaller captive pens to train hunting dogs. These wild (captive) animals are exposed to horrendous stress, injury and constant harassment in these facilities\/pens. If they survive, they survive another day only to be tortured again during these \"training\" sessions. Dog fighting is shunned and illegal, yet our province wants to open up more of these horror compounds and pass on grandfathered licences.\nNo to this barbaric proposal.\n",

Instead of cultivating a reverence for life, this activity encourages a complete disregard leading to a lowering of standards of care for all species, including our own.\nRecognizing this, Ontario passed a law in 1997 to phase out new penned hunting facilities for good reason. Penned hunting is incredibly cruel to the coyotes, foxes, and rabbits who are used as live bait and are chased and killed by packs of dogs. The dogs forced to participate can also suffer from injuries and death.\nIn addition to extreme and mindless animal cruelty, penned hunting is a public health risk. The trade and transportation of wildlife is a major contributor to the spread of disease and parasites, including zoonotic diseases that can infect wildlife, domestic animals, and humans.\nResearch on Canadians' attitudes is clear: more than four out of five are against hunting animals for sport. No other Canadian province allows penned dog hunting, and the cruel practice is unlawful in most of the United States.\n\u00a0\nI count on our society to do the right thing for animals and public health and don\u2019t undo all of the progress made to phase out penned hunting facilities. Our government should instead focus on strengthening the existing legislation, and shut \u00a0down the 24 remaining train and trial areas in the province.\nI look forward to this government's prompt action not to allow this heinous and base activity that allows a perverted disregard for the lives of sentient beings.

As stated by Mahatma Gandhi, \u201cThe greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated.\u201d  To allow selected animals of \u2018less value\u2019 to be terrorized, hunted, abused, tortured & killed violently in the name of training is an archaic, arrogant ideology that will set Ontario & Canada back even farther regarding animal welfare & protection laws. As of 2020, a study conducted by the World Animal Protection global charity and graded 50 countries regarding animal welfare & protection. An \u2018A\u2019 being a top score & \u2018G\u2019 the lowest. Canada was given a \u2018D\u2019 rating. This scoring included an assessment of the countries legislation to protect wildlife. As more & more scientific studies show that many, many other creatures are sentient beings with thoughts, feelings, & self awareness, Canada should be fighting for the rights of those that can\u2019t speak for themselves. We have no right to exploit the lives of wildlife as a means to our ends and try to justify it as schooling.  This isn\u2019t the Middle Ages. This proposal brings us closer to that rather than moving us forward. In 2023, not only do we know what sentient beings animals are and how much more alike we are to them but there are also countless, non-costly, humane methods to train canines. They are also incredibly intelligent, recently studies showing even much more than believed. Dogs are completely capable of learning without the suffering of another animal. A bear doesn\u2019t need to have claws & teeth ripped out & be chained to the ground to teach dogs to hunt.  That\u2019s considered abuse. Using smaller animals in what is basically a penned yard is no different. I am obviously completely against this proposal. I will fight this however I\u2019m able. I will be sure to notify my local representatives regarding this and will not support any person or party that finds this idea acceptable.\n",

In the United States alone, according to the American Center for Disease Control, 4.7 million people are bitten each year by dogs, with children between the ages of 5 and 9, and senior citizens getting bitten the most. This results in 20 to 30 deaths (of all ages) per year. Training dogs to hunt and kill wild animals can make them more aggressive, and I am worried this will lead to more preventable accidents in parks and neighborhoods. Additionally, there is also the cruelty to the creatures that are being hunted, which I find upsetting. The Harris government placed restrictions on these kinds of activities a quarter of a century ago in order to protect wildlife, and I believe that was a good decision made by the Progressive Conservative government at the time.\nThank you for considering my thoughts on this issue.\n",

He was charged with cruelty to animals and went to court and was convicted. You are thinking of allowing a similar thing.

This is obviously cruel, as any reasonable person can understand.\nIt appears that the Doug Ford government is willing to pander shamelessly to the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters, and other sport hunting lobbyists. Please be reminded that most Ontarians do not hunt; and do not want wild animals to have pain and suffering inflicted on them for such frivolous reasons.\nI urge the Premier and all Ontario MPPs to stop this shameful practice.

Is the government peopled completely by profit-grabbing barbarians?! Stop and think for a minute about what you are teaching your children. Is this the side you wish to stand on?\nPenned hunting is incredibly cruel to the coyotes, foxes, and rabbits who are used as live bait and are chased and killed by packs of dogs. The dogs forced to participate can also suffer from injuries and death.\nIn addition to animal cruelty, penned hunting is a public health risk. The trade and transportation of wildlife is a major contributor to the spread of disease and parasites, including zoonotic diseases that can infect wildlife, domestic animals, and humans.\nResearch is clear: more than four out of five Canadians are against hunting animals for sport. No other Canadian province allows penned dog hunting, and the cruel practice is unlawful in most of the United States.\nPlease do the right thing for animals and public health\u2014don\u2019t undo all of the progress made to phase out penned hunting facilities.

No. It begins in the wild, where they fall victims to the traps used to \u2018harvest\u2019 them.\nThese barbaric training methods do not align with views and principles of citizens. Ford likely wants to increase these facilities so more of his friends can profit.\n",

If you want your dog to chase coyotes or rabbits away from your crops, they can be trained without resorting to torture of animals, whether wild 'caught' or raised for this purposed (a whole other area of extreme animal torture).\nNaturalist experts and environmental diversity experts should be consulted and they would explain why this practice is as outdated as dog fighting or bull running and should be banned.\nSociety needs to evolve to be more compassionate and accepting of the rich diversity of our ecosystems and relegate the torture of animals for human pleasure in the distant past.

These dogs are loose and not controlled to reduce stress and disruption to surrounding environment. Hunting is a sport or hobby where the challenge should be for a person to harvest and animal, not for dogs to round up and harvest prey at will. An ethical hunter with gun or bow aims to execute an animal efficiently and effectively while overcoming that animals natural instincts and connection with its surrounding environment. A hunter can select targets and wait for a legal animal or better option. Dogs do not have this logic or foresight and their job is to chase down and kill wild animals.\n",

Foxes and Coyotes can safely and effectively be hunted using rifles if the need arises, and that would be the most \"acceptable\" use of the dogs listed here.

This practice has been in the process of phasing out for 25 years and there are still over 20 centers that use it. What critical need is there that this practice must be expanded? What has changed in the last 25 years that other training options are no longer viable and this is the best solution?\nWhen considering any action that involves significant harm to animals or wildlife, the most important question that should be asked are - what are the possible alternatives to this? This proposal has not asked this question. Why are less harmful alternatives not being considered? The decision to phase out this practice was already supported by the harmful effects on wildlife outweighing the benefits in training for the dogs.\nI believe that this proposal has not been carefully considered and does a disservice to the ministry's decision, scientific research, and public input from 25 years ago. Choosing to progress this proposal without addressing these real concerns will show that our government is more interested in following through with plans than ensuring that they are moral, ethical, and the best possible option.

I firmly reject this proposition for several compelling reasons.\nFirstly, I find the concept of penned dog hunting facilities to be inherently cruel and inhumane towards the wild animals involved. These innocent creatures are subjected to various methods employed to train dogs for hunting purposes, causing them immense distress and suffering. It is fundamentally wrong to take wildlife from their natural habitats and confine them for the entertainment and convenience of hunters.\nIn particular, the use of rabbits, coyotes, and foxes as mere pawns in the training of dogs and for hunting competitions is especially appalling. These animals deserve to live freely and thrive in their natural environments, not be exploited and held captive for the purposes of human recreation. Such practices go against our responsibility to protect and respect the welfare of all living beings.\nFurthermore, the decision to open applications for train and trial spaces after a span of 25 years represents a significant regression into the past. Rather than progressing towards a more compassionate and ethical approach to wildlife conservation, this move is a step backward. These facilities, with their inherent cruelty and lack of regard for animal welfare, have no rightful place in the province of Ontario.\nTherefore, I strongly urge you to reconsider the proposal to allow new licenses and the transfer of licenses for train and trial areas. Instead, it is imperative that the existing 24 facilities in the province be closed immediately. This action would demonstrate a commitment to ending the suffering of innocent animals and align with the values of compassion, respect, and responsible stewardship of our natural environment.\nThank you for your attention to this matter.

Do you think your political masters will stand up for you then?

        "comment":"Strong Opposition to Proposed Train and Trial Areas Legislation - Addressing Animal Cruelty and Torture\nDear Reader,\nI am writing to express my vehement opposition to the proposed changes regarding train and trial areas in Ontario. As a concerned citizen, I feel compelled to emphasize the severe animal cruelty and torture associated with hunting captured animals. It is essential to recognize the moral implications of this practice and the unimaginable suffering it inflicts upon sentient beings capable of experiencing pain, fear, and distress.\n1. Animal Cruelty: Hunting captured animals within train and trial areas constitutes a deeply troubling form of animal cruelty. It involves subjecting innocent wildlife, such as cottontail, snowshoe hare, red fox, and coyote, to prolonged confinement and intentional harm. This intentional infliction of suffering solely for training and entertainment purposes is fundamentally cruel and inhumane.\n2. Torture of Captured Animals: By allowing hunting dogs to pursue captive wildlife, the proposal effectively endorses a scenario akin to torture. These animals, incapable of escape or self-defense, endure relentless pursuit, fear, and distress, resulting in immense physical and psychological trauma. Such intentional infliction of suffering on helpless creatures is morally reprehensible and should not be condoned by a civilized society.\n3. Ethical Considerations: It is our moral duty to protect and respect the inherent rights of all living beings, including animals. Encouraging and permitting the hunting of captured animals goes against the principles of empathy, compassion, and kindness. A society is judged by how it treats its most vulnerable members, and endorsing such practices undermines our moral standing and integrity.\n4. Alternatives for Ethical Engagement: In an era that promotes compassion and ethical treatment of animals, we should be fostering practices that align with these values. Encouraging positive reinforcement-based training methods that do not involve the exploitation and harm of captive wildlife is a progressive and humane approach. We must strive for methods that emphasize respect for both animals and the natural environment.\nI urge the Ontario government to reconsider its stance and reject the proposed changes regarding train and trial areas. It is our collective responsibility to protect the welfare and rights of all living beings, ensuring a compassionate and ethical society for both present and future generations.\nThank you for your attention to this critical matter. I implore you to consider the profound ethical implications of endorsing practices that inflict cruelty and suffering upon animals.\n",

This is undoubtedly frustrating. I can see how it would be difficult to partake in a seemingly authorized activity but have increasing barriers to access.\nDespite the above, it think it is almost unquestionably true that these activities and this sport constitute animal cruelty. A Conservative government some 25 years ago started down the path to ending these practices in our province. We should not stop this process of moving away from animal cruelty. The solution to the mixed messaging and frustrations of users of the facilities is to act decisively and immediately prohibit their operations entirely and to ensure that organizations such as the Ontario Sporting Dog Association are prohibited by law from promoting such activities in any other fashion.\n",

I can't torture and kill a rabbit or coyote on my property without animal cruelty charges (and I would never ever want to) so why are these facilities allowed to exist and possibly expand.\nSociety should do everything possible to protect wild animals, they have a place within the ecosystem and should never be subjected to this kind of torture, for the amusement of humans.  If you want your dog to chase coyotes or rabbits away from your crops, they can be trained without resorting to torture of animals, whether wild 'caught' or raised for this purposed (a whole other area of extreme animal torture).\nNaturalist experts and environmental diversity experts should be consulted and they would explain why this practice is as outdated as dog fighting or bull running and should be banned.\nSociety needs to evolve to be more compassionate and accepting of the rich diversity of our ecosystems and relegate the torture of animals for human pleasure in the distant past.

This proposal, which entails the despicable practice of subjecting captive coyotes, foxes, and rabbits to cruel treatment, is not only morally abhorrent but also demonstrates a gross disregard for the welfare and inherent rights of these innocent creatures.\nThe notion that dogs are allowed to chase down terrified animals held captive in minuscule enclosures is deeply disturbing and entirely unacceptable. It is an act of sheer cruelty that inflicts unimaginable fear, suffering, and trauma upon these defenceless beings. Subjecting animals to such torment, where they are forced to endure a relentless pursuit and ultimately face the grim prospect of mutilation, is an affront to our shared sense of empathy and compassion.\nThe proposal put forth by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry flies in the face of ethical principles that prioritize the welfare and protection of all living beings. It is a regressive step that harks back to a time when society was largely ignorant of the inherent rights and dignity of animals. We have made significant strides in recognizing the sentience and intrinsic value of animals, and it is disheartening to witness a government body propose actions that actively undermine this progress.\nMoreover, allowing the transfer of licenses for such abhorrent practices demonstrates a disregard for the responsibility we bear in ensuring the enforcement of ethical standards and the prevention of animal cruelty. By enabling the easy transfer of licenses, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry would effectively turn a blind eye to the potential for further abuse, as individuals who are willing to engage in such heinous activities could acquire these licenses with minimal scrutiny.\nAs members of a civilized society, we must unequivocally reject any proposal that promotes the subjugation, torture, and mutilation of innocent animals for the purposes of training and entertainment. It is our duty to protect and advocate for those who are voiceless and vulnerable, and to demonstrate compassionate and responsible stewardship over our natural world.\nI call upon the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry to reconsider its proposal and instead focus on initiatives that foster respect, coexistence, and the preservation of biodiversity. We must strive for a harmonious relationship with the environment and its inhabitants, one that is grounded in compassion, empathy, and a profound understanding of the interconnectedness of all living beings.\n",

Penned dog hunting facilities are cruel to the wild animals who are subjected to various methods used to train dogs to hunt. It\u2019s also extremely dangerous to the general public. I was out camping last year and was able to see the dangers this \"sport\" poses to the public when a group of dogs came into our campsite and tried to attack my friends dog. The dogs were followed by a man in a truck with a loud speaker attached. When we told the man about the situation, he neither stopped to help, apologized, nor left his truck. Instead he became aggressive and stated that his dog was a \"hunting\" and that it had clearly been lured to our campsite because we had left food out - which is no defense for the aggressive actions of his dog in a licensed camping area. He called his dog, who looked unkept, was clearly hungry and aggressive, who ran further up the trail followed by his vehicle. Further up the trail were more campsites and more people camping peacefully with their animals. We are experienced campers in a group and were able to make sure nothing significant happened to our dogs or ourselves, but if I had been at the campsite alone or just with my dog it could have been a very different story. This is why I believe that training dogs to hunt, especially with wild animals in train and trial arrangements, is not only cruel to wild animals but dangerous to the rest of us who are simply trying to enjoy the outdoors in peace. The reckless decision to open applications for train and trial spaces after 25 years is a massive step backward into the past and danger waiting to happen in the present.

I stand firmly against this proposal, as it not only disregards the well-being of our wildlife but also perpetuates cruel practices in penned dog hunting facilities.\nImagine the plight of wild animals subjected to the heart-wrenching methods employed to train dogs for hunting.

It's an egregious violation of their rights and a mockery of the balance and harmony that should exist between humans and nature.\nRather than embracing progress, the decision to open applications for train and trial spaces after 25 years seems like a leap back into a time when compassion and respect for wildlife were far less prevalent. We should be moving forward, championing ethical treatment and preservation of our natural wonders.\nIn the spirit of progress and compassion, I firmly believe that it's time to close the existing 24 facilities in Ontario. By doing so, we can send a resounding message that our province values the welfare of wildlife, rejects outdated practices, and embraces a future where animals are no longer exploited for human amusement.\nLet us not be complacent in the face of such cruelty.

        "comment":"While I appreciate the ministry's efforts to ensure proper care for wildlife and to provide opportunities for the training of hunting dogs, I must express my reservations about the proposed changes to the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act, 1997 (FWCA).\nFirstly, the proposed changes intend to increase the number of train and trial areas. These enclosures restrict the free movement of wildlife, which is contradictory to the principles of animal welfare and natural behaviours. The animals involved in these trials are subjected to chronic stress, which can result in a variety of physical and psychological problems, including abnormal behaviours and decreased immune function. A study published in \"Applied Animal Behaviour Science\" in 2016 shows that confinement can induce stress in animals, which can have harmful effects on their health and overall well-being.\nSecondly, these train and trial areas may unintentionally promote the view that animals are mere tools for human entertainment, rather than sentient beings deserving of respect and care. Such a perspective can potentially lead to an erosion of empathy for wildlife and disregard for their rights, which goes against the increasing global consciousness towards animal rights and welfare.\nFurthermore, the claim that the environmental consequences of the proposal will be neutral seems to lack sufficient evidence. The proposal mentions that coyote, red fox, and rabbits would be sourced sustainably, but it does not account for the potential disruption to local ecosystems. Removing animals from their natural habitats could upset ecological balance, as these species play critical roles in their ecosystems, including controlling rodent populations and contributing to seed dispersal. As the 2019 report in \"Science\" journal demonstrated, even minor disturbances to ecological systems can have cascading effects that are hard to predict.\nIn terms of economic consequences, the proposal suggests they would be neutral to positive, but there's a lack of a detailed economic impact analysis. The costs associated with the establishment, maintenance, and regulation of new train and trial areas, as well as potential liability issues arising from accidents or injuries during training or competitions, are not clearly addressed.\nLastly, the proposal seems to overlook alternative, more humane methods of training hunting dogs that do not involve live game. Techniques such as drag hunting, where a scent is laid for dogs to follow, can effectively teach dogs to pick up scent trails and track without subjecting wildlife to stress or harm.\nIn conclusion, while the proposed changes may appear beneficial on the surface, a deeper examination reveals potential negative implications for animal welfare, environmental health, and societal views on animals. I would urge the ministry to reconsider and explore alternative, more humane and sustainable methods for training hunting dogs.\n",

I also own a dog which will soon be charged with protecting livestock. I disagree that penned hunting of animals by dogs should see its practice expanded and further licensed. Wherever control and harvest of any small game is warranted, efforts should be directed at humane methods. Competition should never justify causing pain and suffering to an animal, in line with other laws preventing animal abuse. I have personally witnessed that the death of wild animals in nature is often violent; humans should however play no part in forcing a cruel, stressful environment with a high probability of painful predatory death on any animal.\nAs it regards the attempt to keep such facilities from going underground, I firmly believe the Province should instead focus on education and enforcement even if done in parallel to an extended phase out. In the meanwhile, remaining facilities which have a justified need to exist beyond any competitive or sport hunting reason should be operated directly by or very closely supervised and inspected by provincial authorities.\nWhile the following was taken from the Animal Alliance of Canada, I support the points as written:\nI firmly reject the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry\u2019s proposal to allow new licenses and the transfer of licenses for train and trial areas in Ontario.\n    Penned dog hunting facilities are cruel to the wild animals who are subjected to various methods used to train dogs to hunt.\n    Wildlife should never be taken from their natural environments and held captive by hunters.

We are capable of being better than this, and our laws should unequivocally reflect that.\nInstead of opening new applications, the province\u2019s existing 24 facilities need to be closed immediately.\n",

Just because caring for animals isn\u2019t in the job description of a government individual, doesn\u2019t give you the right to allow abuse of wildlife. There is no valid reason that this needs to exist.\nYou learn about ecosystems and the food chain in the third grade. Needless allowing for the deaths of coyotes will have amplifying impacts on all of the wildlife in Ontario.\nThe fact that the coyotes will have places to run and hide does not absolve you from the terror you are knowingly inflicting on these creatures and their inevitable injuries. This goes against everything that we stand for as a province and a nation.\n",

Since this is a conservative agenda there is likely a money trail to follow that explains the normalizing of such cruel, unethical behaviour.\n",

Most people don't have the courage to do the right thing, especially when faced with powerful opposition. That's what makes our world always bend toward injustice, because moral courage is often in short supply.\nIf you make the wrong decision here, remember that lack of moral courage within you. That you decided to do the wrong thing out of fear that the powerful hunting lobby would target you. Or maybe because you lack compassion and don't have an issue with cruelty and the exploitation of other sentient creatures.\nAs you've probably already realized, I wholly and utterly reject the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry\u2019s disgusting proposal to allow new licenses and the transfer of licenses for train and trial areas in Ontario.\nWhy? Well:\n1. Penned dog hunting facilities are exceptionally cruel to the wild animals that are subjected to disgusting methods used to train dogs to hunt. How exactly is something like this any different than dog fighting and the horrific methods they use?\n2. Wildlife should never be taken from their natural environments and held captive by hunters. It\u2019s especially cruel to use rabbits, coyotes, and foxes as pawns for hunters to train dogs \u2014 and hold competitions.\n3. Opening applications for train and trial spaces after 25 years is a massive step backward into an ugly and sickening past. These facilities have no place in Ontario.\nThis absurdity needs to go the way of all animal fighting events. Instead of opening new applications, the province\u2019s existing 24 facilities need to be closed immediately.\nWe are meant to protect all life on this planet, not use it for our psychopathic enjoyment of cruelty and pain.\n",

The Ministry is supposed to protect our natural resources and uphold ethical standards and regulations, not exploit these resources and sell out our province's ethics and wildlife. It is my firm believe that we, as Ontarians, need to reconsider our sense of entitlement to natural spaces and the non-human species who live within these spaces. They are not ours to exploit and torture. The world is cruel enough without our intentional and deliberate infliction of harm - both physical and emotional - on other beings.\nWe live in one of most beautiful places on Earth, and we share this space with a fascinating array of non-human species. I am in utter disbelief that the government would even consider moving forward and allowing such blatant disrespect for Ontario's wildlife, wild spaces and ecosystems, not to mention the inherent cruelty perpetuated by these programs. I really can't believe that I have to speak out and say NO, I don't believe it is ok to capture and steal animals from their natural spaces, hold them hostage in pens, and then allow them to be ripped apart by dogs with no chance to escape.\nTHIS IS LEGALIZED DOGFIGHTING. Is this really the Ontario we want to create? Is this really how we want to be seen by the rest of the country, or by the rest of the world? We have come so far to advance our animal welfare laws. By comparison to many other countries, we are seen as leaders with some of the highest standards of humane treatment of the animals - whether livestock, domestic animals, or wildlife. To allow this proposal to move forward is a massive step backwards for our province, and a stain on our national and global reputation.\nI respectfully ask you to reconsider this proposal. Please step back and consider what this decision means, on a broader level than simply appeasing a group of hunting enthusiasts. This is an opportunity to demonstrate the Ministry's leadership in fostering appreciation and respect for our natural resources. It is an opportunity to uphold the highest standards of ethics and humane practices - something that all Ontarians count on you to do. It is an opportunity to move Ontario forward in a positive and progressive light. It's an opportunity to say NO, we will no longer condone this type of exploitation of our province's resources.\nPlease shut down these trial and train areas - all of them - for good.\n",

The language used in the proposal attempts to sound benign, as if the focus is to improve the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of dogs. In the proposal, one supposed benefit is to \u201cprovide a dedicated space for training where dogs and wildlife are contained and safe.\u201d Safe? Seriously? It most certainly is not safe for wildlife and, I assert, not beneficial to the reputation of the province of Ontario.\nIn the proposal provided on the Environmental Registry of Ontario, the MNRF claims to have examined the regulatory impacts and the economic consequences of the proposed changes. Other potential impacts seem to have gone unexamined.\nOne can read about this topic from many sources, including the discussions that led the Harris government to ban the practice and cease the issuance of new licences in 1997. In order not to reiterate what you have likely already read in your own research or received in comments, I will point you to the debate in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba on the Wildlife Amendment Act, in April 2000 which includes multiple points worth considering. The relevant link to Hansard is here:\nhttps:\/\/www.gov.mb.ca\/legislature\/hansard\/37th_1st\/vol_017a\/h017a.html\nThe term \u201cdog trialling\u201d used by Ontario is called, in this discussion in Manitoba, \u201cpenned hunting.\u201d They offered a description of what happens when wildlife is enclosed in a fenced-off \u201ctrial area\u201d and people and their dogs are allowed to hunt them down. A simple word search will show you that the adjective \u201cdisgusting\u201d is used 12 times in this debate to describe the practice. I could not agree more.\nOne member of the legislative assembly pointed out that penned hunting is in actuality a form of privatization of our natural resources, for the benefit of the few. Another called it industrialization and exploitation of wildlife. Why is the province of Ontario allowing this practice? The basic premise of Fish and Wildlife Conservation is that wildlife should be preserved. Forests and natural resources should be protected and used only when necessary, and with humility at that.\nIt is interesting to read the words of the Manitoba parliamentarians who were hunters themselves taking umbrage at the comparison of their sport to the unsportsmanlike killing of penned wildlife. They wanted to distinguish what they viewed as their skilled hobby, the tradition of hunting for the purpose of providing sustenance, from the unskilled, unethical and unnecessary murder of wildlife. They pointed out, quite rightly, that the act of penning is an act of taking wildlife hostage and subjecting them to a life of terror followed by a terrifying death. They stated that penned hunting is simply violence as a form of entertainment. Be careful what you stand for, Ontario. You can label this as the trialling of dogs, but the actual training that is taking place in this setting is the training of humans to kill without remorse, to enjoy watching living beings be terrorized and torn apart. This system is training humans to be comfortable as abusers. Then we wonder why vulnerable people in our society are abused. When women are abused, children are abused, members of the LGBTQ community are abused, visible minorities are abused, Muslims are abused and indigenous people are abused, politicians offer \u201cthoughts and prayers.\u201d We don\u2019t want your thoughts and prayers. We want your leadership in positioning Ontario as a province that reveres its wildlife and protects its environment.\nOntario has lost the opportunity to be a leader in the field of thoughtful, fair and compassionate wildlife management, but we still have time to be a follower and get out of this awful business of dog training and trialling (penned hunting). Do not issue more licences. Do not allow the transfer of licences already issued. Then, take one more necessary step: eliminate those licences that already exist and shut down the practice entirely.\n",

This inhumane and unethical practice subjects captive wild animals to cruelty, abuse, and suffering.\nThe proposed changes would be a disturbing reversal of a previous 1997 decision to phase out train and trial areas.\nI don't understand how Canada, a highly evolved and progressive country, known for championing human rights, can lag so far behind in its animal welfare policies. On the Global stage, Canada received a failing grade from World Animal Protection for our continued lack of adequate animal welfare laws. Ontario should be pushing for urgent improvements in protecting its wildlife, not backtracking to the dark ages and destroying it for sport!!! I am certain that the majority of Ontarians feel the same. The government needs to listen!!!\n",

It\u2019s especially cruel to use rabbits, coyotes, and foxes as pawns for hunters to train dogs and hold competitions.\nFor the Ministry to condone the trapping of wildlife for this use seems to me to go against the mandate of the ministry which is to protect the environment.\nPlease see the website below for research done in Britain on the use  of dogs for hunting although some of it only pertains to Britain Part 3 outlines the effect of this practice on wildlife quoting other studies from different countries.\nThe amendments should be withdrawn and in fact the current facilities should be shut down!

        "comment":"By attempting to re-establish the process of hunters capturing wildlife to be used in fenced in areas for means of \"training\" or \"sport\" is doing much more harm than good. I have provided 3 reasons as to why:\n1. Habitat Fragmentation and Loss: Training and trialing areas often require the development of infrastructure and the modification of natural landscapes. This can lead to habitat fragmentation, where wildlife habitats are divided into smaller, isolated patches. Fragmentation disrupts wildlife movement, gene flow, and access to essential resources like food and shelter. It can negatively impact wildlife populations, especially species that rely on large, contiguous habitats or have specific habitat requirements. The Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act aims to protect and manage habitats, and the creation of training and trialing areas could conflict with these conservation goals.\n2. Disturbance and Disruption of Wildlife: The establishment of training and trialing areas can introduce additional human activities and disturbances into natural habitats. Frequent noise, presence of people, and other activities associated with training and trialing can disturb wildlife and disrupt their natural behaviors. This disturbance can cause stress, alter feeding and breeding patterns, and even lead to the abandonment of important habitats. The Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act seeks to ensure the conservation and well-being of wildlife, and activities in training and trialing areas may not align with these objectives if they cause significant disruptions to wildlife populations.\n3. Increased Human-Wildlife Conflicts: Training and trialing areas often attract human visitors and increased foot traffic, which can lead to human-wildlife conflicts. These conflicts arise when wildlife populations are disturbed or habituated to human presence, resulting in negative interactions or safety risks for both humans and wildlife. Such conflicts can have detrimental effects on wildlife populations, including increased stress, habitat avoidance, or even the necessity for lethal wildlife control measures. The Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act promotes the responsible management and conservation of wildlife, and training and trialing areas that contribute to conflicts with wildlife can be inconsistent with these conservation principles.\n",

Bringing such a practice back would be a massive step backwards in our society and put Ontario on the map as a province that supports and endorses animal cruelty and barbaric animal practices.\nOur wildlife numbers dwindle every day because of human expansion, they don't need more help with reducing their numbers and they certainly don't need more acts of cruelty brought on by humans. We as a province should be protecting our wildlife! This does not seem to be the focus of the Provincial government and that should change.\nWith so many other resources out there for training animals, utilizing living creatures is the least necessary. Also, as someone who works in a shelter facility where many of these \"trained hunting dogs\" end up as \"strays\", I can say with confidence that it affects the stray dog population, as many of these \"hunters\" merely abandon any dog that cannot meet their \"training standards\", resulting in an overpopulation of stray dogs in shelters that are close to areas that still live this backwards way of life.\nWhile I understand in some regions, hunting and hunting dogs have their place, for survival ect. Ontario is very much a province that does not really need this. Its largest populations are located in cities or towns where food and other amenities are easily accessible and therefor render hunting unnecessary for survival. When it comes to population control of over producing wildlife, most hunters involved in that don't even use hunting dogs. My father and many of his friends are these people and not a single one of them relies on a hunting dog during the season.\nOnce again, I end my statement with as an Ontario resident I share  my FULL OPPOSITION towards allowing new licensing and legal use of these training facilities and will not support a government who allows this to return in any future elections, I will share this far and wide and educate and encourage others to do the same.

While I respect hunters (there are many in my family) and support their ability to hunt food for their families, this proposal will add large amounts of unnecessary cruelty to wildlife without necessarily improving conditions for hunters. There are other ways to train dogs that do not require torturing wildlife. If the Government of Ontario permits these facilities to become more common and the cruelty involved becomes more widely known, the inevitable backlash from animal lovers will make life worse for all hunters. We should promote best practices in ethical and sustainable hunting in Ontario so that this way of life remains viable into the future.\n",

Needless to say, animal welfare is a cause near and dear to my heart - and I was absolutely floored and horrified when I learned that this proposal is very much real.\nI understand and appreciate the need to train \"sport dogs\" - but this barbaric and cruel practice is not the way to do it.  In researching this matter, the ethical best practice around training sport dogs for the purposes of hunting is to use scented dummies - why would the ministry not support this? It is unimaginable to me that our government is in support of trapping (and in some cases, purchasing) animals for the purpose of being shredded, mutilated and ultimately sacrificed when there is a perfectly reasonable solution that does not involve any level of animal cruelty.\nThese prey animals are living beings. They feel emotion such as fear and panic... and they also feel the pain of being eaten alive by a predator animal.\nAt the outset of my comment, I mentioned that I am not one to normally become involved in social causes, but I quite literally can't believe that this practice continues today and is occurring in my own proverbial backyard. I beg the Ontario government to reconsider the practice of using live animals for this purpose - I urge you to take a more humane approach to the training of hunting dogs by using scenting methods or scented dummy animals to train.

        "comment":"Subject: ERO # 019-3685. Proposal To Allow the Issuance of Licenses for New Dog Train and Trial Areas, and To Allow the Transfer of Licenses.\nTo Whom it May Concern:\nI am an active hunter and have been so for over 44 yrs. I have also enjoyed hunting with a dog (upland game birds and waterfowl) for years too. I am the son and grandson of hunters and trappers. Hunting is part of my upbringing and my heritage. I grew up understanding that anything I was hunting deserved my utmost respect and it is a privilege to be able to hunt that species.\nI retired after 35 yrs. as a MNRF Enforcement Manager from an Enforcement Unit in Southern Region. Prior to being a manager I worked in that same unit\/district as an Intelligence\/Investigations Officer and a field Conservation Officer. In each of these roles, I had involvement with investigations related to Dog Train and Trial  Areas(T & Ts) and hound coyote hunting in the wild.\nAs a result of the experience and knowledge that I have gained through these investigations and intelligence gathering, I am very much opposed to the proposed change to the regulations that will allow the sunset clause for coyote and fox T & Ts that was put in place when the FWCA was enacted. Below are the reasons why I hold this conviction.\n1)\tA great deal of consultation was done by the authors of the new regulations in the lead up to the 1997 enactment. I am aware that consultation was very broad and included T &T operators, T & T users, and other interest groups and the general public. At that point it was decided that the new act would not shut down the T & Ts immediately but that phasing out of them would be the most appropriate course of action.\n\u2022\tWhat has changed since 1997? Has the public of Ontario become more tolerant toward wildlife being kept in captivity for the sole purpose of having hunter\u2019s dogs chase them around? I doubt that the general public, has become more tolerant towards an activity that is very easy to paint in a very negative light. I have not seen any indication that the public has moved in a similar direction with any other issue.\n\u2022\tWho is requesting this change? I suspect that only the individuals that are involved in the sport of hunting Coyotes, and Rabbits with hounds think that this is a good idea. That is a very small group of people with a vested interest in it and, in my experience, a very different view of how a coyote deserves to be treated than most of us. I have seen a number of 30,000 individuals that are involved in this request. Based on my experience, that number is probably very inflated. It clearly includes many folks that have never participated in hound hunting for coyotes or rabbits, but think by supporting it, they are somehow protecting all hunting from a slippery slope. I suspect that the entire membership of OFAH is included. It is not a form of hunting that is on the up-swing, and in the case of hound hunting coyotes, should not be encouraged to grow, for reasons I will state below.\n2)\tThe proposal background refers to the T & T licenced areas being highly regulated. With the experience that I have related to individual licensees and hunters that use or supply coyotes to the licensees, I would suggest that there are many well-meaning regulations and licence conditions in place, but that most of them are very difficult to actually monitor for compliance or enforce.\n\u2022\tI have found that in any group of people there are 3 kind of people:\n\u2022\tOnes that will never knowingly break a law (maybe about 10%)\n\u2022\tOnes that will never obey a law (maybe about 10%)\n\u2022\tOnes that will not break a law if they think they could get caught (80%) This is the group of people that effective regulations and monitoring efforts have the most effect on. I seriously question if the current T & T and hunting regulations are effective to deter this group.\n\u2022\tThe issue with the current regulations and licence conditions for T & Ts is that they look really good on the surface, but when you really know how T & Ts work and how difficult it actually is to do an inspection or investigation into T & Ts activities, it is very easy to see how a coyote hunter, a T & T operator or a T & T user would realisation that getting caught violating the regulation or licence conditions is very unlikely. This proved true in the intelligence and evidence I was able to collect when I spent some time really looking into T & Ts and hound coyote hunters. The violations were blatant across the entire MNRF Southern Region.\n\u2022\tThis is what we found was happening\n\u2022\tMany T & Ts had to restock their pens annually with new coyotes, but there were very few reporting any injuries or mortality or escapes or any lawful purchases from authorized trappers. The need to restocking had a several causes.(hounds in the pen killing the captive coyotes, escapes under, through or over snowed over or tree damaged fences, etc)\n\u2022\tIt became clear that most T & Ts were restocking their pens with coyotes that were illegally captured by hunter\u2019s hounds in the wild. The hunters would find coyote tracks in the snow and release hounds on those tracks. The dogs had radio collars on so the hunters could follow the chase. As chase dogs got tired, they would pick them up and release fresh dogs on the coyote trail. As the coyote appeared to get tired, they would release their \u201ccatch hounds\u201d. (Nb: many times these chases lasted for an hour or more) These dogs were not afraid to get bit and actually enjoyed biting the coyote. This resulted in many hound\/coyote fights. Then the hunters would walk into the property, pull the dogs off the coyote and snare pole the coyote, (if the coyote was still alive) and drag it out to the road and put it into a dog box to transport it to a T & T.\n\u2022\tSo if we had good information that this was happening and that it was clearly inhumane and illegal, why did we not just charge them and put an end to it? Knowing what is happening is way different than being able to prove it in court.\n\u2022\tAnswer: Loop Holes (that still exist)\n\uf02a\tInspections of the T & Ts can really only effectively monitor a few of the conditions on a T & T licence. (the condition of the fences on that day, the presence of a log book that has some entries in it, condition of cover structures, etc) For the rest of the regulations and conditions, the inspector is left trusting the operator\u2019s answers. (how many coyotes are in the pen, if there have been any injuries, mortality or escapes, if any coyotes have been brought into the pen, how many hounds have run in a day or how many days in a row, what and how much supplemental food has been fed to the coyotes, etc)\n\uf02a\tConservation Officers have caught several hound coyote hunters with captured live coyotes, but were unable to make them release them, or charge them for capturing coyotes for the purpose of keeping them in captivity. There is a section that allows a person to have a wild animal in captivity for a day, if it is injured, to allow them to get it medical attention. Each of these coyotes had been caught after an exhausting chase and a dog fight, often with several dogs in the fight, so each of the coyotes were injured to some extent and the hunters knew of this exception and claimed that is why they had the coyote. Nothing the CO could do at that point.\n\u2022\tSo how do I know all this? After going several seasons of being frustrated by not being able to deal effectively with these blatant and inhumane violations I decided to reach out to the other MNRF Enforcement Units in Southern Region to see if they were seeing the same patterns. It was clear that all of Southern Region, which is the area of the province where almost all hound coyote hunting occurs, was seeing similar occurrences. At that point it was decided that the only way to collect the evidence required to charge hunters and T & T operators for these blatant offences was to embark on a Special Investigation (Undercover Investigation), because inspections and uniform field enforcement had not been effective. So we enlisted an undercover officer to join a specific hound coyote hunting group who was led by a T & T operator for the winter. He was able to collect evidence of the following:\n\u2022\tThere were at least 3 groups of hound coyote hunters that were actively illegally capturing live coyotes via dog fights with exhausted coyotes operating in that area.\n\u2022\tThese groups were supplying at least 2 licenced Coyote T & Ts.\n\u2022\tThe main group the UC had contact with (the one that had the T & T operator leading it), did not carry firearms, but just relied on the hounds to catch the coyotes at the end of each long run.\n\u2022\tThe same coyote group had an exhausted coyote \u201cgo to ground\u201d in a window well at the back of an Amish Church during a service. The resulting dog fight, brought the entire congregation out to see what was happening. Our UC Officer had a very difficult time to get the dogs to let go of the coyote. The coyote was then stuffed in a small (40 gal) plastic barrel with 2 previously caught coyotes by the T & T operator to be transported back to the barn in his T & T.\n\u2022\tOn one day, the group caught 7 live coyotes in the same way, they transported them all back to the barn and 6 of them were put into a very small pen in the T & T operators barn. The other coyote was forgotten and somehow survived for a week in a small dog box on the back of a hunting truck for a week without food or water.\n\u2022\tWhen we executed a search warrant at the end of the winter hound coyote hunting season, we seized 23 live coyotes that were being kept in a very small pen (room) inside the T & T operator\u2019s barn. They had been stored there to be released into the T & T for the spring, summer, fall pen season.\n\u2022\tDuring an inspection, prior to and in preparation for the UC project, the T & T operator had told the inspector that he still had the same coyotes that he started with many years ago. In fact, as the UC learned, each year all the coyotes had either been killed and\/or had escaped from his pen, but T & T operator didn\u2019t care because he enjoyed spending the winter catching new ones.\n\u2022\tAt the time of our takedown of the primary T & T operator, the UC officer also determined that another T & T operator was in the same position, he and his hunting gang had also illegally caught coyotes throughout the winter hound coyote hunting season and had them in captivity ready to release into his T & T as soon as spring maintenance of his fences were completed.\n\u2022\tThat same winter, another hunting party had caught live coyotes using the same methods, and traded the primary T & T operator for free hound running time in his T & T in the summer.\n\u2022\tThe UC also determined that all the violations he observed had been going on for years. They had carried on this way without the fear of prosecution because they knew all the loopholes to use to make prosecution difficult. They also thought it just made sense to use the coyotes they were chasing and catching anyway to restock the T & Ts so they had a place to run their dogs in the non-snow season.\n\u2022\tThey were also very concerned that people should not be told about how every one of their coyote chases ended with their dogs piling onto an exhausted coyote. They recognized that the general public would \u201cnot understand\u201d. Or in other words be outraged.\n\u2022\tAt the end of this investigation, over 150 charged were laid against hunters within 2 of the hound coyote hunting groups and the T & T operator that was the primary focus of this investigation. The same T & T operator\u2019s T & T licence was revoked by the Minister of Natural Resources. A good result, but this was only made possible because of a very complicated and time consuming Special Investigation. We were unable to use normal compliance monitoring and enforcement methods to deal with this issue because the regulations and the tools available to regulate this T & T Licence were insufficient.\n\u2022\t It is important to also point out that the regulations and licence conditions that exist today are the exact same as were in place when this investigation occurred. This investigation did not result in any regulatory changes.\n3)\tI suspect that part of the assessment of this regulation change will have included a search of data bases to see if there have been any issues found in the last several years at the T & T facilities. I am sure that if that search happened, they would have found no record of any issues with T & T facilities. I would like to add a bit of context to that:\n\u2022\tAbout a year and a half before COVID all the MNRF staff that were responsible for the licencing\/authorisations (not including hunting and fishing licences) and compliance monitoring of those licences\/authorisations were advised that travel had been restricted and that no unnecessary travel would be allowed. This effectively prevented those staff from going out to T & Ts to conduct inspections unless there had been a complaint. Then COVID happened and that further restricted their ability to do proactive compliance monitoring. So it would not surprise me if there has not been anyone checking to see if the remaining T & Ts are complying with regulations and conditions.\n4)\tThis proposal indicates that new T & Ts can provide trials to allow more people to engage in the sport of testing their dogs in hound hunting coyotes. I am not sure that there is as big a demand for this as is indicated. I have never heard there are a bunch of folks who do not want to hunt coyotes in the wild, but just want to do dog trials. The folks that I am aware of who go to trails spend most of the winter out running coyotes from concession road to concession road until they catch or shoot it. I know that this proposal does not contemplate the value of hunting coyotes in the wild, but I have an opinion, and coyote T & Ts would not exist if hunting with hounds in the wild was not allowed.\n5)\tI have also seen it stated that the T & T facilities allow the dogs to be trained in a safe manner that improves their ability to only run one species which will reduce conflict with others. I do see the logic in that, but also have an informed view of what the real cause of conflict between hound coyote hunters and the public is. It is not generally that hounds are chasing species other than coyotes, it is that hounds running coyotes in the wild will inevitably chase them through private land that is posted against hunting. The hound hunters will not keep a dog that chases anything other than coyotes, but appear to be unable or in some cases unwilling to prevent their hounds from trespassing to hunt.\n6)\tThe other thing that I think important to highlight here is that the T & T operators are almost all hound coyote hunting enthusiasts and are not in it to make any real amount of money and really are not able to generate a significant profit by operating these T & Ts. That requires them to run them on a shoe string budget. As a result, we found that individuals that run T & Ts cut costs where ever they could. (using donated unmatched fence pieces, doing repairs on fencing themselves when they get a chance instead of hiring someone to do it in a timely manner, not wanting to pay for trappers to catch coyotes, doing their own vet treatment, feeding coyotes dead stock that they can get for free, etc.)\n7)\tI acknowledge that my experience with hound coyote hunters and Coyote T & T operators was heavily focuses on serious violators of the regulations and licence conditions and that not all hound coyote hunters or T & T operators have the exact same attitudes, but also recognise that this proposal will allow others to open more T & Ts with the same lack of effective oversight, so similar activities could occur undetected for years again.\nPlease do not go forward with this proposed regulation change. We almost had it right in 1997 by sunsetting the T & T authorisations. To open it all up again and allow it to continue with no real effective way to ensure the humane operation of them, is misguided in my view.\n",

Penned hunting is incredibly cruel to the coyotes, foxes, and rabbits who are used as live bait and are chased and killed by packs of dogs. The dogs forced to participate can also suffer from injuries and death.\nIn addition to animal cruelty, penned hunting is a public health risk. The trade and transportation of wildlife is a major contributor to the spread of disease and parasites, including zoonotic diseases that can infect wildlife, domestic animals, and humans.\nResearch is clear: more than four out of five Canadians are against hunting animals for sport. No other Canadian province allows penned dog hunting, and the cruel practice is unlawful in most of the United States.\nPlease do the right thing for animals and public health\u2014don\u2019t undo all of the progress made to phase out penned hunting facilities. Your government should instead focus on strengthening the existing legislation, and shutting down the few remaining train and trial areas in the province.\nThank-you,\n",

If you want your dog to chase coyotes or rabbits away from your crops, they can be trained without resorting to torture of animals, whether wild 'caught' or raised for this purposed (a whole other area of extreme animal torture).\nNaturalist experts and environmental diversity experts should be consulted and they would explain why this practice is as outdated as dog fighting or bull running and should be banned.\nSociety needs to evolve to be more compassionate and accepting of the rich diversity of our ecosystems and relegate the torture of animals for human pleasure in the distant past.

Disgusting, inhumane and unethical.\nWhy would the Government of Ontario want to even consider allowing new facilities to be licensed to train dogs to cruelly hunt captive live foxes, coyotes and rabbits as training bait?  Instead, you should be considering closing down all existing \u201cTrain and Trial\u201d locations.\nWe are outraged that there are 24 Train and Trial licensed facilities still in business in Ontario.  There should be none allowed.  Some animals are caught by trappers which is traumatizing, then they are sold, and released into these penned enclosures only to be terrorized again.  And some of the wildlife may be bred to provide offspring for future captive hunts.\nThese wild captive animals are often viciously killed by the dogs.  What type of people would request permission to allow this horrific and brutal animal abuse, and what about our government officials who are entertaining such a request.\nTo read the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry\u2019s \u201cProposal details   Background\u201d information (Your ERO number 019-3685, \u201cProposal to allow the issuance of licences for new dog train and trial areas and the transfer of licences\u201d) is in itself extremely unsettling (excerpt):\n\u201cTrain and trial areas are enclosed areas on private land where certain wildlife (i.e.  cottontail, snowshoe hare, red fox or coyote) are kept captive for the purposes of teaching dogs hunting skills such as picking up scent trails, tracking, and pursuing game at a safe distance.  They are also used to conduct hunting dog competitions (known as \u2018trialing\u2019).  The fenced areas are designed to keep both the wildlife and the dogs confined to the area (not allowing for the free passage of wildlife).\nTrain and trial areas are utilized to:\n\u2022\ttrain hunting dogs to only pursue specific game species in the wild by having them practice in a controlled environment\n\u2022\texercise hunting dogs in the off-season\n\u2022\tprovide a dedicated space for training where dogs and wildlife are contained and safe, to avoid conflicts with other land and resource users\n\u2022\trun trialing competitions where dogs are scored by judges for their hunting abilities\u201d\nWe do not understand how the government can justify this animal brutality.  Are you aware that more than four out of five Canadians oppose hunting animals for sport.   We hope that you will also be one of those Canadians who opposes hunting for sport.\nOn one hand, the Government of Ontario established the Ontario Animal Protection Call Centre for the public to report when they think an animal is in distress or being abused, and on the other hand, we have the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry considering a \u201cProposal to allow the issuance of licences for new dog Train and Trial areas and the transfer of licences\u201d.  Sport hunting is not a necessity.  Help us understand this contradiction.\nWe wholeheartedly are opposed to any additional Train and Trial facilities being allowed to open, and we would like to see the Government of Ontario close down any facilities that are still open.\nWe hope you agree with our position and if not, we would like to hear from you why not.\nSincerely,\nANIMAL DEFENCE LEAGUE\n   OF CANADA\nMrs. J.

Penned hunting is incredibly cruel to the coyotes, foxes, and rabbits who are used as live bait and are chased and killed by packs of dogs. The dogs forced to participate can also suffer from injuries and death.\nIn addition to animal cruelty, penned hunting is a public health risk.

I am writing to oppose this policy on the strongest possible terms.  As a professor who teaches human animal relations I see five problems with this proposal that are significant enough to reject it soundly.\n i) There are dog breeds that have been bred over centuries to hunt and to assist humans with hunting. It is redundant to train them to do something they are bred to know how to do.  Rather than teaching dogs skills they would not have otherwise, the practice would simply encourage blood lust in dogs that would be problematic in other venues.\n ii) It is a cruel and outdated suggestion to cage animals for the purpose of tearing them to bits. It violates the idea and principle of animal rights and denies wild animals (coyotes, wolves, bunnies) the dignity of living according to their own natural instincts and habits. This policy would almost certainly be contested by organizations dedicated to defending the rights of animals.\n iii) This legislated carnival of killing would teach hunters that killing wild animals for the simple pleasure of practicing on them is a great idea. This is a gross exaggeration of traditional hunting values.  iv) the practice would encourage the idea that setting up one set of animals to kill another set of animals could be an exciting spectacle. It is reminiscent of the most brutal practices of ancient days and has no place in contemporary society.\nv) The world is on fire in some places and sinking under the rising oceans in others.  Human societies including Canada  are struggling to develop more intelligent and sustainable relationships with the natural world.  The natural world includes wld animals and the places that sustain them.  This proposed policy harms the possibility of learning to treat wild animals, wild spaces, and natural resources with humility and respect.\n",

        "comment":"This is to express my outrage to Schedule 14, Bill 91, Less Red Tape, Stronger Economy Act, 2023. Apart from the fact that the Walkerton water crises of 23 years ago should have taught the Conservative Party that \u201cred tape\u201d, aka regulations, can be essential, and in addition to learning that the party\u2019s current leader is a liar, for reneging on his promises to protect the Greenbelt, I now have confirmation that he is just plain cruel.\nI currently live in a small city but I still own the rural property where I  used to live, adjacent to farmland, and I can tell you that while my own acreage was far too small to be affected, my farming neighbors were too often distressed by hunters trespassing on their lands in pursuit of hounds chasing foxes, coyotes, or whatever. That Mr. Ford wants to assist such criminals by increasing their ability to train scent hounds is bad enough. That he does so because they currently break the law seems to assume that miraculously the slob hunters who find fun harassing wild animals (who by law belong to me, too!), will suddenly reform, is stupidly na\u00efve.\nBut worse, the proposed legislation pits large numbers of dogs against any given coyote, fox, or rabbit, reducing the likelihood that the terrified \u201cprey\u201d cannot find whatever shelter might exist in time to escape being torn up alive (as happens in chases on public and private lands \u2013 there being no effective enforcement against it).  The kind of scum who enjoy this sort of thing are no different than those who attend cockfights, or would attend public executions if they could, the truly sicko slob hunters who give real outdoorsmen a black eye.\nI did not even know about this until quite recently. The government seems to be inundating us with bad choices and hoping we don\u2019t notice, and while I am not usually the kind to speak out, enough is enough.  This is brutal.  What is wrong with a man who would seek votes by allowing and encouraging actions that lead to innocent animals being terrified, being torn apart, in order to what \u2013 gain some votes?  Mike Harris was right to end the practice but erred in not doing so completely, by allowing it to die out by attrition.\nIn addition to his cruelty and his lying, Mr. Ford treats voters as fools by putting into this horrible proposal the stipulation that animals injured be taken to veterinarians.  My daughter works for a small animal veterinarian clinic and she can assure you that even people who love and care for animals find it hard to meet the cost of veterinarian bills for their beloved pets \u2013 are we really supposed to think someone willing to see a live animal torn to pieces by attacking dogs will take an animal for veterinarian care?  Their own dogs, maybe, if it makes economic sense to do so (I have had dogs all my life and would never subject one to this sort of thing) but not a wild animal.  I would urge in strongest terms to completely reject this horrible, sick idea and at the very least return to what the Harris government decides while increasing funding for enforcement of animal cruelty laws.\nBut what\u2019s the use. This bill has already been tabled, and the ERO process is clearly a sham, another way Mr. Ford shows his dictatorial contempt for the citizens he governs. Shame on Mr. Ford, shame on his party.\n",

The ministry will take a 1997 law that was designed to be phased out and expand the number of individuals who can trap foxes, coyotes, and rabbits and teach their dogs how to kill them (not just track and exercise them). For $100, individuals get to do this on \u201cprivate land,\u201d which thanks to Ontario\u2019s new ag-gag laws means that journalists, concerned citizens and animal rights groups can\u2019t expose any \u201cwrong doings\u201d. The proposal frames this decision as a way to avoid contact with others, but that isn\u2019t the real reason. Significantly, the government promises that the sites will be inspected to ensure that the land is properly fenced-in, but doesn\u2019t mention oversight regarding animal cruelty, continuing inspections, or an increase in inspectors \u2013 which is already perilously low. Also revealing is the ministry\u2019s promise that the new regulation won\u2019t lead to a decline in the overall numbers of rabbits, foxes, and coyotes \u2013 but the issue is animal cruelty. The present regulations dictate that the hunted animals must have natural or man-made locations where they can escape from the dogs that are being trained to kill them.

No one can claim that the licence holders didn't have many years of warning that this has to end some day; the phase-out was, in effect, written right into law. The intention to phase-out these areas was deliberate. These areas should not exist, but you propose to allow them to persist by transfer and to allow more of them.\nNo change in society since 1997 has made it somehow acceptable now, when it wasn't then, to continue indefinitely into the future the use of trapped wild animals as bait to train hunting dogs. It was and still is cruelty to wild animals to use them for this purpose.\nYou say that train and trial areas are used to train hunting dogs and \"provide a dedicated space for training where dogs and wildlife are contained and safe...\". That should be corrected, because wildlife in these areas are certainly not safe. Being terrorized by dogs is not safe.\nYou appear to assume that the training of hunting dogs to hunt is a necessary activity. Is that because you assume that hunting with hunting dogs is necessary? But it is not necessary. No one \"needs\" hunting dogs to hunt. The wish of some people to use hunting dogs to hunt is not a need, and does not justify the cruelty that happens when they are used.\nThe use of hunting dogs is an archaic, cruel and unnecessary practice that has never made the world a better place. What social progress does the government see in more use of hunting dogs? There is none. Your proposal is a backward step for Ontario. It would encourage more people to train hunting dogs to hunt, and to use hunting dogs in hunting, both of which mean more cruelty to wild animals.\nWild animals that are hunted while in captivity suffer stress repeatedly. It is prison with repeated terror, death being the only escape. What crime did these wild animals commit to deserve this? Why does this belong in Ontario?\nYou say that \"the ministry has received requests for changes to allow dog train and trial areas to continue to persist\". How many requests were there? Why does a cruel activity that was to be phased-out and is engaged in by a tiny part of the population, warrant this response from the ministry to change the law for their benefit? If the government received the same number of requests to bring back cock fighting, would we then see a proposal, with \"standards of care\", \"restrictions\", etc, to bring it back? Is any cruel activity ok so long as someone somewhere wants to do it, and there are \"conditions\"?\nThe Provincial Animal Welfare Services Act says in section 15 that no person shall cause an animal to be in distress, and no owner or custodian of an animal shall permit the animal to be in distress, and no person shall knowingly or recklessly cause an animal to be exposed to an undue risk of distress. All of these conditions are broken for a wild animal pursued by dogs in a dog train and trial area. The law specifies an exception for an activity permitted under the FWCA \"in relation to wildlife in the wild\", but \"in the wild\" does not cover captive animals. Which exception in the PAWS Act allows the distress caused to captive animals by what the FWCA allows in a dog train and trial area?\nWhy is there no mention in your proposal of the distress caused to the captive wild animals, and of the legal basis for allowing it? It appears that you do not want the public to know about or think about this distress. The most important effect of this proposal is more cruelty to wild animals. Yet your \"Regulatory impact analysis\" is silent on that. It is written as if there is an economic opportunity and no negative consequences. You say the proposal \"removes barriers and creates an opportunity for new persons to participate in the existing regulatory framework\". You say the proposal would \"offer benefits to persons who use dogs to hunt or track wildife\". Using hunting dogs to hunt is a social ill dating from past centuries that has no justification. But you wish to encourage it. You see \"opportunity\".\nThe whole proposal is written as if morality does not matter. Why does a province which passes an act disallowing animal distress, a law which appears to be motivated by moral concerns, have no moral concern about the distress of a captive wild animal used as bait for hunting dogs?\n",

This is government sanctioned cruelty, plain and simple; dragging grotesque and sadistic practices from a time long past into the present. Torturing wild animals for sport or personal gain should be anathema in a society that makes any claim to decency, morality, dignity and justice. To expand licensing for the gain and amusement of vanishingly small special interest group is not in the interest of Ontarians. Ontario should not allow the expansion of this abominable practice and should take steps to bring it to an end once and for all by making it illegal.\n",

It certainly was not the idea of a intelligent and compassionate person who values life.  It was the idea of a person who enjoys watching living things suffer and die in pain and fear. This misguided attempt to court and reward hunters makes Ontario look backward and morally corrupt. We (and Ontario wildlife) deserve better than this.\nShelve this proposal where it will never again see the light of day and begin to address the larger issues of habitat loss, pollution via factory farming,  development of meaningful care standards for farmed animals, video monitoring of all factory farms and slaughter houses,  prosecution and severe consequences for abusers of farmed animals,  inhumane transport standards for farm animals, puppy mills, persecution of wolves, the ongoing use of strychnine with \u201cnuisance\u201d wildlife,  roadside zoos and entertainment events which exploit and mistreat animals. Then consider the use of the leg hold trap, the seal hunt, abuse of marine mammals in zoos and parks, ban on importation of properly vetted dogs from international rescue associations\u2026I could go on and on.\n   There are major issues regarding animal welfare in Ontario \u2013 issues which have not been addressed in any meaningful way.

To put the wishes of Ontario hunters and their dogs above the protection of wildlife (and commercially purchased domesticated animals) is totally unacceptable.  Dog training and competitions are the hobbies of a small number of hunters, and provincial wildlife belongs to all of us. Many of us in the public do not approve of the terrorizing, injuring and killing of animals for entertainment. We do not support any type of legislation or licensing that supports or expands hunting in any way. Please consider the lives (and unnecessary suffering) of foxes, rabbits and coyotes and firmly shut down this proposal once and for all.

        "comment":"I am writing to express my objections to the newly proposed hunting dog train and trial spaces and reopening of licensing for such activities in Ontario. In 1997, the province decided to close down the development of any new training areas and to close applications for new licenses.  At that time, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Fisheries obviously felt that expansion of this policy was not necessary or appropriate. I would like to think that part of this decision was related to protection of indigenous wildlife from mistreatment.\nHowever, for unconvincing reasons, the MNRF has reversed its position and again wants to expand train and trial areas and allow new licenses to be granted to hunters and their dogs. As far as I am concerned, this represents a giant backward step for the people of Ontario and its wildlife.  It grants hunters and hunting dogs protected status and legitimizes the mistreatment of our natural wildlife.   If this proposal is enacted, it will allow the development of more sites where captive foxes, coyotes and rabbits (without avenues of escape) can be threated and harmed just for the entertainment of dogs and hunters. These facilities have no place in Ontario.\nInstead of expanding this inhumane practice, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Fisheries should be closing the remaining 24 sites and permanently withdrawing all licensing for this type of abusive activity. Wildlife is a gift to all Ontarians and hunters with dogs should not be allowed to interfere in any way with its protection.\nThank you for your attention to this matter of importance to many Canadians.\n",

Penned hunting is not allowed in many states in the US. Animal advocacy groups and humane societies are horrified at the prospect of penning hunting. Yet here comes the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Fisheries with a proposal to expand sites and increase licenses for this \"sport.\" which allows hunters with dogs to chase and kill captive wildlife who have no option to hide or run.  The captive animals are trapped in their natural habitat and transferred to pens where they are terrorized and killed by hunters and\/or their dogs. What kind of people do this sort of thing (for fun and relaxation)? What sort of provincial government chooses to support and expand this abuse of wildlife? Why is this even under consideration when the vast majority of Canadian disapprove of this type of animal abuse?  Instead of promoting such cruelty to foxes, coyotes and rabbits, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Fisheries should be shutting down the remaining penned hunting sites in Ontario and permanently cancelling any licenses previously given to hunters. The majority of people of Ontario  would never consider engaging in such a inhumane \"entertainment\", and the MNRF proposal is designed to please and to encourage a tiny minority group that does not care about animal welfare and enjoys going out on the weekend (often with their children) to have a precious family moment killing living creatures.

This was certainly the case when the spring black bear ban was reinstated. The majority of non-hunters do not know GPS-collared dogs are trained to track, terrorize and tree large animals and that in training them smaller animals are ripped apart. It is no life for dogs either, who are starved, kept in sheds, and too often abandoned at end of season. We are regulating animal cruelty to facilitate lazy hunters. The Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry must ensure the same representation from non-hunters, the vast majority,  as hunters in its decision-making process.

Keep other coyotes away from their established territory and are overall beneficial to the entire eco system, so are foxes. Both species control the rodent population - rabbits included. Coyotes have a part in controlling the deer population, getting rid of sick and injured individuals directly helping to control the ever increasing ticks in Southern Ontario.\nIn addition coyotes hunted by dogs become dog aggressive and  dangerous. This is a well known fact.  Coyotes which are left alone go about their business unless you get close to their pups, even then they will threaten but not attack.\nA good dog can effectively dispatch a rabbit and does not need a training facility.\nLicensing these facilities makes the Ministry an accomplice in a barbaric practice no different than training for dog fighting.\n",

        "comment":"This penned wildlife proposal is barbaric. I cannot imagine how anyone could support such a cruel and unsportsman-like activity.  I takes no skill to have dogs chase down a terrified wild animal who cannot escape. There is no decent, humane use for any of these dog \"training\" exercises, and no hunter kills coyotes or foxes for food or clothing.  Hunters and their dogs do not go out to appreciate nature, to bond with friends or their own children or to feed their hungry families. They go out to kill living sentient creatures who are massively disadvantaged and outgunned, and then pretend that they are important, competent, brave, tough and (in most of the cases) manly. But they are none of these things but rather they are  emotionally blunted, cowardly, insensitive to suffering and frankly rather small and pathetic people who are damaged in some serious way. And I have to assume that the people who developed and promoted this proposal are cut from the same cloth. The behavior of hunters is accepted by only about 20% of Canadians. Penned hunts are not allowed in any other province. They are banned in many US states. So why is the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Fisheries trying to support and amplify an inhumane practice that compassionate and socially responsible people whole-heartedly reject?  This proposal should not even need a public review. It never should have been put forward in the beginning.  It does not reflect public values or serve the public in any way. It breaks the hearts of kind people and gives them nightmares. And it speaks to the extent to which the Ministry of Natural Resources and Fisheries are willing to ignore public opinion and endorse open abuse of Canadian wildlife. Please retire this proposal and shut down all existing penned hunting locations.\n",

So what exactly has changed?\nNot only are the poor animals that will be used as bait, subjected to cruel and inhumane trapping, but they are then kept in \u201cless than ideal conditions\u201d aka terrified and constantly stressed, ( anything other than back in nature is less than ideal) until they get brutally attacked by a \u201clearner\u201d dog, or die of fright or starvation.\nPlease provide details of how these facilities are inspected and monitored by Government resources , (or have they been on the honour system of reports all this time?) and the documentation they are required to provide to qualify for and maintain their licenses.\nHow many times have licensed wildlife vets been called out to provide care or medical attention to these animals - especially those already maimed by inhumane trapping?\nFor those rabbits \u201ctransferred\u201d from other licensed facilities, what condition are they in? Too old and sick to be of use where they came from? If they are raised for food or medical experiments are they \u201cimpaired\u201d by lack of exercise due to caging? Too fat to even run away if they\u2019ve been bred for meat?  They will most certainly not be wild rabbits which should be the \u201crequirement\u201d for the training of hunting dogs!\nFor sick or infected animals - rabies is easily contracted from infected prey animals - what restrictions are in place to prevent cross contamination of species?\nWhat if any diseases or pathogens are these poor animals tested for and are they quarantined under humane supervised conditions before being admitted as hunting bait? What would constitute humane conditions for a wild animal to be kept under other than being allowed to return to the wild?\nI would also point out that for scent training purposes, a stressed animal smells distinctly different than a relaxed one, so you are training \/ rewarding a dog for detecting an animal in distress at such facilities.\nSo if your dog can\u2019t quite match that smell he has been trained to recognize, he will soon learn to create it by attacking and torturing his prey to create that \u201cstress effect\u201d smell. Dogs trained under such conditions will be vicious and unreliable!\nAs I do not believe you can provide favourable or indeed any answers to the majority of these questions under your current regulations, I urge you to withdraw this proposed legislation change and go back to the spirit of the 1997 proposal and withdraw current licences from the remaining 24 premises, as originally intended when this horrible experiment was first enacted.\n",

It seems to me that the training of hunting dogs falls far short of any definition of \u201cnecessity\u201d. More urgently, as a property owner I ask what sort of mindset the proponents of the expansion exhibit when they essentially threaten the integrity of private property ownership if the number of penned hunting areas isn't increased.\nBeyond these broad policy issues there is a self-evident question of ethics and morality involved in this matter. In what sense is it \u201csporting\u201d to turn dogs loose in an enclosed area to track, pursue, and ultimately kill prey animals that are contained and unable to escape? In what sense can this be considered moral and humane? This model of (so-called) hunting is more akin (to borrow an old phrase) to shooting fish in a barrel than to sport hunting. I consider the entire process to be cruel, repugnant, and an affront to those many hunters whose notion of hunting involves a measure of respect for animals.\nI believe that Ontario should be reducing the number of areas approved for this cruel practice rather than increasing it.

There needs to be more training areas because the access to the current ones is very limited.  Also with so many anti hunters and no trespassing these are a safe space for everybody to enjoy.\n",

The proposal is being positioned as a way to preserve the livelihood of *24* licensees; however, it ignores the horrific cruelty and life of terror that such facilities inflict on the captive wildlife.\nThese operations are inherently cruel in that they involve confining farmed or trapped coyotes, foxes, and rabbits to compounds where packs of hunting dogs are encouraged to chase, harass and kill these captive animals. A condition of the license is that there is no escape for these unfortunate creatures (O. Reg. 668\/98, s. 35 (2)). The regulations allow these trials to last all night long ((O. Reg. 668\/98, s. 33 (4)). The animals can be hunted for all but 72 hours a week (O. Reg. 668\/98, s. 42 (4)). Trials can go on for three days straight (O. Reg. 668\/98, s. 42 (6)), and there can be as many as 50 dogs hunting at one time (O. Reg. 668\/98, s. 42 (1)).\nThis is not simply a case of \u201cTag! You\u2019re it!\u201d  The regulations clearly recognize that these trials result in the maiming or death of the captive wildlife (O. Reg. 668\/98, s. 35 (5)).\nCan you imagine being trapped, forcibly relocated, released into unfamiliar territory, and hunted daily? Eventually, your luck runs out, and you are caught and mauled by the dogs, torn limb from limb, or shot by the facility operator. Animals caught up in this system cannot be released back into the wild. Death is their only escape. What a terrible, sad life we are condemning these animals to live; years of terror that culminate in a slow and painful death.\nThese victims are not \u201cjust a bunny\u201d or \u201cjust a fox.\u201d Anyone who has cared for animals knows they are all thinking, feeling creatures. They know pain and fear. Wild animals who have the misfortune to cross our paths are not our playthings to be treated cruelly.\nThis \u201ctrain and trial\u201d activity is in the same league as cock fighting and pit bull fights. Ontario is the *only* province in Canada where this barbaric activity continues. Surely, we have advanced since the days of Roman blood sports.\nInstead of opening new applications, remove this initiative from the Bill 91, Less Red Tape, Stronger Economy Act, 2023 and close the existing facilities immediately.\n",

More training and trialing areas in Ontario will give hunters and sporting dog community members better access to these areas, giving them more opportunities to create well-trained dogs in safely enclosed and regulated areas, ensuring they have the ability to identify the correct game species when it comes to time to hunt.\nFurthermore, more training and trialing areas also contribute to local economies where they exist through hunter and competition participant travel and visiting expenses and provide a small business opportunity to people.\nLastly, getting outdoors to train your dog at a training and trialing area is a great way to be active and spend some quality time with your dog, something that can be very beneficial for physical and mental health. Not only is it great for the handler, but being able to give your dog the opportunity to exercise and work on their skills also makes for a happier dog with a higher quality of life.\nTraining and trialing areas are important to the sporting dog community and to Ontario\u2019s hunting heritage. For these reasons and more, I support the proposal. Thank you for the opportunity to provide my comments.\n",

Statements made in support of an expansion of penned hunting suggest fear that dog sport hunting will \"move underground\" and may potentially cause unwanted wildlife conflicts, but I see that as a separate issue. If sport hunting using dogs is a potential problem, the entire practice should be banned. If the practice is to go on, then it should only happen where there are fair odds and the quarry can escape. There should be no expansion on penned hunting facilities. Whether the animal is trapped and brought in to be hunted in a penned facility or bred to be hunted is moot; the practice is cruel, inhumane, at odds with the increasing concern Ontarians have towards animals, and deeply unfair to those captive individuals.

The Provincial Government is proposing to expand the number of \u201cpenned dog hunting facilities\u201d licenses (wildlife death pens) that are allowed in Ontario. Foxes, Coyotes and wild rabbits are put in large wildlife death pens and then a pack of dogs is turned loose to hunt then down. This blood sport is considered entertainment and even have judging matches. This is similar to dog and rooster fighting that has been outlawed in Ontario (PAWS Act section 16). Why is it legal for wildlife.? The idea of capturing wildlife put them in a wildlife death pen and have dogs tear apart for sport is barbaric and inhumane.\n     The Sporting Dog Association and the Ontario Federation of Anglers  have lobbied the Ontario Government to expand this inhumane sport because they claim there is a growing demand.\n    The Harris Government stopped issuing new licenses back in 1997 and would not allow the transfer of them.

        "comment":"Training and Trialing using Captive Coyotes\nThis concerns the reported plan of the Ontario government to increase the number of licences for \u201ctraining and trialing\u201d enclosures where dogs learn to hunt coyotes.\n1. \tThe clearest and most obvious reason for NOT doing this is that the activity involves animal cruelty, and must surely go against animal welfare laws of the province.\n2. \tI have read the description of one practitioner who owns such an operation, describing brush piles and underground tanks that the coyotes can escape to. This raises two questions: how many coyotes don\u2019t make it to shelter and are killed by dogs? Of the coyotes that make it to a refuge, how long before they undergo this life-threatening terror again?\nIt is cruel to chase and kill and animal that cannot escape, and it is likewise cruel to subject an animal to life-threatening terror over and over again. This is considered torture.\n3. \tThe government of Mike Harris brought in legislation around 1997 that was aimed at phasing out this practice. The intent of the legislation was clear: the government would not close down existing licenced locations, but would issue no new licences and would not allow licences to be transferred. This was a clear signal to people engaged in this activity that the practice must cease, although they were given ample time to wind up their businesses. They have now had 25 years to do so, and anyone who still owns a \u201ctraining and trialing\u201d location must be nearing retirement age, unless licences have changed hands covertly.\n4. \tThere has been considerable progress in the academic field of animal behaviour over the last quarter century and it is now accepted mainstream understanding that all animals have the same range of emotions as humans. Indeed, anyone who was paying attention in their high school science classes would realize that the theory of evolution points overwhelmingly to this being the case. Humans are animals and do not have any \u201cnew\u201d traits, just more of some things, such as abstract reasoning. More but not different. Thus is it even more imperative now than when the legislation was first brought in that this cruel practice of terrorizing living animals must stop.\n5. \tI am not asking the present government to go beyond the provisions of the original legislation. I merely ask that the process be left to reach its intended conclusion. There will be fewer and fewer licenced \"training and trialing\u201d areas until at last there are none.\n6. \tRegarding the question of sport: some people hunt for food and eat what they kill. Some people hunt for the thrill. People looking for a thrill have many options these days. The world is huge and complex and offers a wide array of opportunities to get the adrenaline flowing. Take up sky-diving. Ride a rollercoaster. If only killing will give you a thrill, see a psychiatrist.\n7. \tAs an addendum, a word about the dogs involved. They are not born killers in the way that they are used in this activity. This is evident from the fact that they have to be trained. In the process of evolution, humans and dogs both acquired a wide range of interests and abilities. Both are predators and have a way of compartmentalizing that allows them to kill and thus to eat and survive and have progeny. But this is only one trait. Both species are social, love to play, make friends, and engage in a variety of pursuits. By causing them to overdevelop just one trait, the dogs involved are not given the chance to fully develop, and this is a form of neglect. This is a lesser evil than the treatment of the coyotes, but it is worth mentioning.\n8. \tRegarding the question of \u201cdriving the activity underground\u201d: that is NOT a reason to legitimise an unacceptable activity. We have laws against many things that continue underground. The laws mean that the people are stopped when found doing such things, and face consequences. As an example, a friend of mine had a \u201crescue\u201d mastiff. This dog had been trained by illegal bear hunters, i.e. poachers, looking for gall bladders for the black market. He was a grey velvet neapolitan mastiff with big droopy sad-looking eyes and a big jagged scar over his shoulder blades. I saw him nearly every day in the dog park; he always came over to see if perhaps I had brought a treat. He made very good use of those droopy eyes, indicating that he was on the verge of starvation. His chubby body told me otherwise! He was a sweetheart and would graciously accept petting if there were no treats. My friend had the TV on one evening, with the dog snoring next to his chair. The program changed and suddenly there were bears on the screen, roaring as bears do. In an instant the dog was on his feet, every hair standing on end, growling at the TV. My friend hastily changed the channel and calmed the dog. The bear-hunters went to jail, but the dog remembered his training. Fortunately in a place where he would never again see a bear.\n",

Are those animals unharmed in trapping? What is the standard of care given once captive in the facility? Is there an opportunity to escape or hide when pursued by a trained dog? What happens if the wildlife is caught, injured or maimed in training? Without proper protocols and regulations in place to protect the wild animals involved in this activity, this practice is needlessly harmful to wild animals.\nWith advanced technology and easy access to realistic decoys and synthetic scents, I believe dogs can be trained without this harmful practice. The trial and train areas are not necessary and should be phased out over time, as intended. Hunting is a sport after-all, it shouldn't be that easy.\nIt is the OMNRF's job to protect our natural resources, including wildlife. This proposal is a step in the wrong direction.\n",

If anything, the Ministry should be reckoning with and addressing the fact that the practice is yet to be phased out after nearly a quarter century and counting! Please, even the folks at the Ministry who proposed this or were compelled to propose it must know that it does not make sense.\n",

        "comment":"I am submitting this comment in response to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment\u2019s proposal to allow for the issuance of licenses for new dog train and trial areas.\nI was shocked to learn this type of facility exists. I suspect my response is one that would be shared by many Ontarians.\nI only became aware of their existence through an online petition started by a veterinarian. My first comment, then, is that it is unfair to be soliciting input on expanding the number of these facilities without first ensuring that the wider public is made aware of their existence. In failing to do so, the Ministry would seem to be guaranteeing that it receives more feedback from those \u201cin the know,\u201d i.e., the users of these facilities. Most of them, I imagine, support the expansion.\nI find it abhorrent that there are legally sanctioned areas where animals, including those sourced through trapping, are hunted in an enclosed area. The argument that they are from \u201csustainable populations\u201d and \u201cthere are no concerns with limited take of small numbers\u201d does not justify the practice in any way. Animals caught in traps should be killed as soon as they are found. (Until I reviewed the details of the proposal, I was na\u00efve enough to believe that traps are designed to be lethal. Obviously, that is not the case, and was another shock.)\nHow is it ethically defensible not to kill these animals immediately, when we know they experience pain (and, focusing on coyotes for the moment, are characterized as intelligent by the Canadian government [https:\/\/publications.gc.ca\/collections\/collection_2018\/eccc\/CW69-4-57-1\u2026])? Their suffering, and the cruelty inflicted upon them, is then compounded by releasing those same animals into an enclosed area, where they have no chance of escape, and hunting them with dogs.\nMost people, I hope, want our world to become a more compassionate, caring place. This must include striving to improve animal welfare. The expansion of this type of facility is a giant step backwards for the Ontario government and for the people (and animals) of Ontario.\nIf training hunting dogs is deemed necessary for the good of our society, rather than for the benefit of those hunters who cannot rely on their own abilities and must involve dogs, then surely it is possible to develop an inanimate training \u201ctool\u201d that does not experience pain and fear.\nI urge you to abandon the proposal to expand the number of these facilities, and to focus instead on revoking the licenses of those that do exist.\nThank you.\n",

If this proposal proceeds to legislation, I will be withdrawing my financial support for the party.\nThis practice of training and competing dogs to track live animals has been eliminated in the rest of Canada and most U.S. states.  Continuing it in Ontario is a massive step backwards in licensing animal cruelty in a progressive province like Ontario.  The proposal states that there are neutral environmental consequences.  This is blatantly incorrect.  Licensing the terrorizing of wild animals for the pleasure of blood sport by the special interest groups that promote penned hunting certainly impacts the rabbits, foxes, and coyotes that are used as bait.

The continued destruction of animal habitat by the current administration's rush to build homes in the Greenbelt - which is not scam by the way - will put enormous pressure on wild life populations.\nCurrently the world's wild life population composes less than 4 percent of existing biomass. Trapping wild animals to use in this extremely barbaric practice, will only do more harm and further reduce wild populations.\nAs well, in Toronto as an example, the racoon population goes through cycles of distemper which are always higher in summer. Putting wild animals and domestic dogs in the same proximity also increases the potential for the spread of distemper and other transmissible diseases.\nWild life should remain wild and not be utilized for this inhumane and outdated practice, I urge the government to reconsider this practice and to phase out the existing 24 facilities in the province.\n",

More training and trialing areas in Ontario will give hunters and sporting dog community members better access to these areas, giving them more opportunities to create well-trained dogs in safely enclosed and regulated areas, ensuring they have the ability to identify the correct game species when it comes to time to hunt.\nFurthermore, more training and trialing areas also contribute to local economies where they exist through hunter and competition participant travel and visiting expenses and provide a small business opportunity to people.\nLastly, getting outdoors to train your dog at a training and trialing area is a great way to be active and spend some quality time with your dog, something that can be very beneficial for physical and mental health. Not only is it great for the handler, but being able to give your dog the opportunity to exercise and work on their skills also makes for a happier dog with a higher quality of life.\nTraining and trialing areas are important to the sporting dog community and to Ontario\u2019s hunting heritage.

        "comment":"I commented earlier about my objections to the proposed expansion of the penned wildlife program which is backward and inhumane.  Then I started thinking. Where did this proposal originate?  Who drafted it? Why did such a extreme proposal not go through any apparent ethics review?  Were there any cautions or objections expressed along the way?  By whom? How did such a proposal get traction when the overwhelming majority of Canadians disapprove of blood sports? How  does this proposal serve the public good?\nI think I have some idea how this terrible idea arose and flourished.  I suspect that the penned wildlife proposal came from Ministry operatives who hunt themselves and want to expand opportunities for other hunters and their dogs. It is simply self-serving, and not reflective of any concern about animal welfare or public opinion. I think that many hunters realize that they are increasingly disrespected and looked down upon. They fear that rational and compassionate people and groups will try to limit them and their abuse of wildlife - which, in my mind, is exactly what should happen.  Not only should new \"training\" areas be rejected, existing \"training\" areas should be removed. The Ministry of Natural Resources and Fisheries is out of step with the public will and needs to refocus on protection of wildlife. It does Ontario and Canada a disservice by promoting cruelty and serving themselves. It is past time for a change in leadership and portfolios.\n",

I strongly believe that these compounds must be phased out which is the intent of the existing legislation which prevents establishment of new compounds and transfer of licenses for existing ones.\nFoxes and Coyotes are intelligent animals with a complex social structure.  I have seen one of these compounds and they clearly involve cruelty to animals in that they take these wild animals out of their natural environment and subject them to extreme stress by:\n-\tTrapping them to capture them for transfer to the compound \u2013 they suffer while being trapped\n-\tConfining them within a fenced-in area which is contrary to their nature where they are intended to roam freely in search of food, providing for their families and interacting socially with other members of their species\n-\tRepeatedly subjecting them to the stress of being chased by dogs without their usual ability to escape since they are confined to a fenced in area\n-\tBeing confined with no escape route increases the probability that they will be caught by dogs and torn apart while still alive \u2013 barbaric to say the least!\nI have had the privilege of watching a fox couple raise their kits near my parents barn years ago.  They have many similarities to human parents.  For example, when they were exhausted by the kits, one of the parents would go to a spot and dig up a dead groundhog and give it to the kits to play with so they could get a break.  Then when the kits were done with it, they buried it again in the same place for next time.  While they were growing up, it was clear to see the different personalities emerging in the kits, just like human children.\nAll wildlife is currently being subjected to additional stress due to climate change and also more and more encroachment on their natural habitat by development such as strip development along roads and subdivision housing in rural areas.  To submit these intelligent animals to additional suffering in these compounds instead of letting them live their own lives as nature intended is beyond appalling.  Given the supposed commitment to \u201cSustainability\u201d by our provincial government, this proposed change in legislation is the ultimate in hypocrisy.\nI live in a rural area where many people hunt.  While I am not against hunting in a fair manner where animals are not confined and have the possibility to escape from hunters and dogs, I am very much against these compounds where wild animals are subjected to so much stress as listed above.  I note that many of the hunters in rural areas are also against these compounds for the same reason \u2013 they violate their ethics regarding \u201cfair game\u201d.\nI\u2019m sure you know that hunters make up a very small minority of people in this province, and given that many of them do not support these compounds, it is clear that the VAST majority of Ontario residents would be appalled and outraged by these compounds if they knew about them.  Most do not know of their existence and to learn that the Ministry is considering changing legislation to allow more of these instead of phasing them out at a time when sustainability, climate change and environmental harm is so high on everyone\u2019s agenda is just out of touch with majority opinion and unbelievable!  Why would the Ministry consider making these changes to pander to such a small minority of our population?   That is NOT democracy!!!\n",

How can this be considered training? In any other context, this abhorrent treatment of native wildlife would be met with significant penalties from the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry. Yet in an attempt to mollify hunters (and special interest groups, such as the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters), this same Ministry wants to expand the practice in Ontario by: \u201cthe issuance of licences for new dog training and trial areas through a one-time 90-day application period; and, the transfer of licences to own and operate a dog train and trial area to new persons\u201d.\nRegardless of the requirement \u201cto conform to strict regulatory standards\u201d, this practice and the proposal to expand such operations is cruel and barbaric.\nIn addition, the assertion that \u201cthe anticipated environmental consequences of the proposal are expected to be neutral\u201d completely misses the point of how incredibly brutal and savage the training of hunting dogs using penned animals actually is.\nThere are only two legitimate solutions:\n1. Close all areas currently regulated for these \u201ctraining\u201d practices under the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act, 1997.\n2.

Not only is it great for the handler, but being able to give your dog the opportunity to exercise and work on their skills also makes for a happier dog with a higher quality of life.\nTraining and trialing areas are important to the sporting dog community and to Ontario\u2019s hunting heritage.

        "comment":"I support ERO #019-3685 Proposal to allow the issuance of licences for new dog train and trial areas and the transfer of licences as written. More training and trialing areas in Ontario will give hunters and sporting dog community members better access to these areas, giving them more opportunities to create well-trained dogs in safely enclosed and regulated areas, ensuring they have the ability to identify the correct game species when it comes to time to hunt.\nFurthermore, more training and trialing areas also contribute to local economies where they exist through hunter and competition participant travel and visiting expenses and provide a small business opportunity to people.\nLastly, getting outdoors to train your dog at a training and trialing area is a great way to be active and spend some quality time with your dog, something that can be very beneficial for physical and mental health. Not only is it great for the handler, but being able to give your dog the opportunity to exercise and work on their skills also makes for a happier dog with a higher quality of life.\nTraining and trialing areas are important to the sporting dog community and to Ontario\u2019s hunting heritage. For these reasons and more, I support the proposal. Thank you for the opportunity to provide my comments.\n",

        "comment":"I was happy in the 90\u2019s when a Conservative government started the process of phasing out licences for dog trial areas in Ontario. I did not think I would have to worry about this regressive practice being allowed again. We are a modern, 21st century society, not some subsistence society that needs to use dogs to survive. The practice of penned hunting under the guise of \u201ctraining\u201d hunting dogs, exercising hunting dogs, and running competitions between these dogs is a not acceptable in a modern society. I find it ridiculous that the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry are even considering this proposal.\nPutting wildlife species into pens with dogs, and allowing them to be chased around is cruel. Normally, this treatment of native wildlife would be met with significant penalties from the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry. I can see no other reason for this proposal than a capitulation to the lobbying efforts of the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters.\nAs a forester who works for the natural resources industry, I spend a lot of time in the forest. Wildlife should be seen in the forest and not being chased around in pens by dogs for the entertainment of people.\nThe only responsible thing to do is continue the phasing out of all areas currently regulated for these \u201ctraining\u201d practices under the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act, 1997. In addition, do not permit the issuance of licences for new dog train and trial areas (or the transfer of existing licences) to occur.\nAllowing the continued use of these facilities would be a failure of one of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry\u2019s primary missions: protecting Ontario\u2019s wildlife and biodiversity.\n",

I find it hard to believe that this is (still) going on in Ontario, let alone that you are thinking of expanding it.\nSo much is wrong with this proposal that it's hard to know where to begin. It is fundamentally inhumane to use wild animals as bait to train dogs, both to the animals and the dogs. Wildlife should never be taken from its natural environment and\/or be held captive by hunters. Dogs should not be used this way for sport.\nEven if these things are deemed allowable in society, it is insufferable that taxpayer money should be used for them. The involvement of the government in this is entirely unacceptable. These facilities have no place in Ontario.

Four out of five Canadians are totally against it, no other province does it and very few states in the U.S. allow it.\n2. The Harris government in the 90s did not support it with the expectation that the practice would be phased out.\n3. The concerns and lack of support for this practice by virtually most of North America are never mentioned or addressed in the proposal.\n4. Nowhere in any of the supporting documentation can we find even any mention, let alone a defence, of the unnecessary stress, suffering, and painful death of wild animals.\n5. We do not see any mention of risks to public health and safety that can occur when integrating with wild animals that can spread disease to domestic animals and humans.\n6. Where is the justification for this proposal? The only message we can see is that there is a growing demand for train and trial facilities and, if not supported legally, they will go underground. This proposal is only about \"a sport.\" I would listen more if some mention was made that these facilities would solve an out-of-control wildlife problem, protect rural communities against wild coyotes, etc.\nThe Impact Analysis of the proposal evaluates environmental and economic effects as basically neutral.\nTherefore, why do it? Hopefully not just \"for sport\" and to please the Ontario Sporting Dog Association and the Ontario Federation on Anglers and Hunters.\n",

They claim that they are performing necessary population control, protecting livestock, dealing with nuisance animals, training their dogs, keeping the wilderness safe for visitors, sharing precious family moments together in the fresh air and on and on. But they are not in the business of public service or protection of animals, birds and fish. No, they are simply indulging and entertaining themselves in a cruel and unnecessary hobby - often with the encouragement and support of \"authorities\" in the provincial government.  Thus, we now have a proposal from MNRF to expand the training and trial locations where hunters can set their dogs on penned wildlife and watch their dogs kill frantic trapped animals. Not a pretty picture! Not so noble! Not an activity that most people respect or approve of.\nSo you tell me. Why has the Ministry forwarded this proposal?  What is in it for them and for the rest of us Ontario residents?  The awful truth is that the MNRF wants to support hunting and please their hunting constituents and friends at the expense of wildlife and  contrary to the clear will of the public.  They want to protect their own interest and jobs. This is not acceptable. It is a bad idea politically. It is bad idea morally. It demeans and trivializes the lives of wildlife. It supports a group of people who should be educated and rehabilitated rather than indulged in their cruelty. Do not reward people who enjoy killing.

I am an educated person and could not make clear sense of this proposal and how it related to coyote annihilation.\nIn an era of scientific advancements, one would think there would be several options to assist with this problem. If in fact areas are penned then the culling of coyotes could be achieved by baiting, shooting, euthanizing to name three. The over-population of any species needs to be addressed be it animal or plant and accomplished in a humane and instant fashion.\nAs well, the trainers of these so called \"hunting dogs\" also concerns me. The mental acumen of such an individual is not solely ingrained upon these sad \"hunters\" but this inhumane mindset speaks also to how many individuals are treated.\nTo think that our provincial government would kow-tow to such a group of individuals is alarming and horrifically sad.

Previously \"New train and trial areas were last approved to be established in 1997 and were intended to be phased-out over time.\", but new intentions are moving to change that position to allow a 3 month period where new applications would be accepted again as well as to allow transfer of licenses (refer to ERO number 019-3685), thereby prolonging the existence of these facilities contrary to original intentions.\nThis proposed change serves to allow what might be termed \"Open Season\" to allow many new facilities to open up and effectively negate the original intentions of the act for ending these \"training\" facilities. We should not allow these facilities to continue to chase, harass, and also kill wild animals in captivity. The dogs will chase the captive animals to the boundaries of the facility and\/or kill them (as is so delicately approached in the proposal, intimating harm to the general wildlife population would be minimal). This is inhumane and unconscionable. The proposal indicates \"The fenced areas are designed to keep both the wildlife and the dogs confined to the area (not allowing for the free passage of wildlife).\". It also indicates \"These species have sustainable populations and there are no concerns with limited take of small numbers for licensed train and trial areas.\", aluding to continually obtaining new or replacement wild animals as they are eliminated from a facility or a new facility is opened.\nThis training practice needs to end. It is simply an easier way for dog owners to participate in an unarmed hunting expedition without the effort and  requirement of making their own scent trail for their dogs to follow using a scent distribution method, such as a scent impregnated cloth being dragged over a trail area.\nThe harm to the wildlife being chased repeatedly is immeasurable. This practice should stop, and owners should be required to lay out a scent trail on their own (or pay for one to be created), on a designated area with no catch or kill of wildlife permitted. No wild animals should be hunted and harassed for training purposes.\nDo not open up new facilities, do not allow the transfer of licenses, and cease this archaic practice as current guidance intends. Instead, encourage the manual creation of scent trails for dogs to follow in a designated area, allowing the creation of licenses for this purpose only.\n",

We find the proposal to be completely inhumane and unethical, and we sincerely hope that through considering the extensive feedback you will receive from other organisations and individuals across the province who are similarly opposed, this proposal will be retracted.\nThe activity of penned dog hunting runs counter to a number of Humane Canada\u2019s position statements:\n\u2022\tWe are opposed to hunting using dogs due to the distress, injury and inhumane death caused to wildlife, in addition to the risk to dogs. Therefore, we do not support any activities to teach dog hunting skills or conduct trialing competitions.\n\u2022\tWe are also opposed to holding wild animals in captivity, as they cannot be provided with adequate care.\n\u2022\tWe are furthermore opposed to hunting in which the target animal is confined.\n\u2022\tPrevalent trapping practices to capture wildlife from their habitat are not humane and cause great risk to non-target animals and humans.\nThis inhumane, unethical activity is completely unacceptable in contemporary Canadian society, which is why steps were taken to phase it out more than a quarter of a century ago. This complete reversal of the past decision is illogical. Rather than re-igniting this activity, the Government of Ontario should be working toward ensuring existing facilities are finally phased out and eliminated, and other requirements are strengthened to make hunting practices more ethical.\nWe believe the assessment of environmental consequences included in the regulatory impact analysis cannot possibly be neutral, since an increase in trapping wildlife to supply animals to be hunted in proposed new facilities will disturb and harm those targeted species as well as others who are incidentally affected, as well as the habitat and other species where traps are set. The proposal and continuing activity of penned hunting for dog training and trialing goes in the exact opposite direction of what is needed to responsibly consider the conservation of nature, particularly given the current compounding biodiversity and climate change crises. While there is an urgent need today to drastically curtail human impacts on wildlife, the activity and proposal heads precisely counter to the approach that is needed.\nHumane Canada embraces the One Health\/One Welfare perspective, which recognizes that the health and welfare of animals is inextricably linked to human health and wellbeing and environmental integrity. This perspective is increasingly being adopted and understood by those who seek to understand the complex inter-relationships of the social, health, and environmental policy issues being dealt with today, and to adopt more holistic, cross-disciplinary approaches to better address them.\nFinally, allow me to take the opportunity to inform you about our project, Measuring Progress Toward a Humane Canada, under which we have developed a list of indicators that will help to measure the status of diverse issues affecting wild animals, as well as companion animals, farmed animals, animals used in science, and, indeed, all animals. Our most recent report under this project, Toward a Humane Justice System for Animals, measures indicators of Canada\u2019s legal framework for animals and whether there is accountability to the law when animals are harmed. The next report under this project will be released later this year and addresses a number of indicators related to wildlife issues. We urge you to review and consider our findings. You will find all the reports at humanecanada.ca\/indicators. Please do not hesitate to contact me directly at toolika@humanecanada.ca should you have any questions.\n",

It is painful to imagine this as an on-going terror for any animal held in captivity that must regularly be hunted for \"training\".  Terrorized animals will also sometimes be killed. The proposal to allow additional issuance of licenses for new dog training and trial areas is inhumane.\nAs a believer in hunting and in the current government I find this proposal lacks logic, empathy and is nothing more than \"Hunger Games for Dogs\".  Dogs can be trained without torturing other animals. The pretend benefit of an economic benefit is marginal and grasping at a hope to find something positive in this proposal that has no benefits at all.\nAny government that supports this proposal will no longer have my vote.\n",

In \u201ctrain and trial\u201d situations they are exposed to extreme psychological distress, and anxiety while being hunted by predators. There is repeated physical trauma when you are running in terror, too.\nThe stress and anxiety the wildlife feel will not abate when the \u201cpenned hunting\u201d session ends. The animals will be under chronic stress dreading the next occurrence of being surrounded by killers and running for their life.\nThat is an unbelievably cruel form of torture.\nHumans subjected to this treatment would develop PTSD. Many animals show lasting changes in behaviour and physiology after a traumatic experience, just like humans with PTSD.\nhttps:\/\/www.smithsonianmag.com\/science-nature\/do-wild-animals-get-ptsd-\u2026\nThe province of Ontario, its government and its citizens should be better people than ones who support and encourage animal cruelty.\nWildlife should not be removed from their natural habitat and held captive for this kind of extreme abuse.\nWe should be progressive in protecting wildlife.\nIncreasing these operations is regressive. Expanding this barbaric practice will put animal protection legislation in Ontario back decades.\nInstead, our legislators should be taking steps to immediately close all existing \u201ctrain and trial\u201d or \u201cpenned hunting\u201d facilities.\nThese facilities have no place in a humane and compassionate Ontario.\nIf more people knew about this proposed change which is buried in \u201cBill 91, Less Red Tape, Stronger Economy Act, 2023\u201d, the outcry would be deafening.\nPlease do not support allowing more train and trial facilities. This is extreme animal abuse and cruelty dressed up as training.\nI am ashamed that my provincial government would even consider subjecting more wildlife to this abuse.\nSincerely,\n",

More training and trialing areas in Ontario will give hunters and sporting dog community members better access to these areas, giving them more opportunities to create well-trained dogs in safely enclosed and regulated areas, ensuring they have the ability to identify the correct game species when it comes to time to hunt.\nFurthermore, more training and trialing areas also contribute to local economies where they exist through hunter and competition participant travel and visiting expenses and provide a small business opportunity to people.\nLastly, getting outdoors to train your dog at a training and trialing area is a great way to be active and spend some quality time with your dog, something that can be very beneficial for physical and mental health. Not only is it great for the handler, but being able to give your dog the opportunity to exercise and work on their skills also makes for a happier dog with a higher quality of life.\nTraining and trialing areas are important to the sporting dog community and to Ontario\u2019s hunting heritage. For these reasons and more, I support the proposal. Thank you for the opportunity to provide my comments.\n",

If you switch the image of a rabbit to that of a family cat and the image of a coyote to that of your family's \"four-legged best friend\", then you will see what I, and thousands like me see.  A horrific, cruel and vicious way for some spoiled dogs to get their jollies out - quite frankly.\nClaiming that this cruelty is necessary for the training of dogs to hunt in the wild, can be easily countered with the empathetically non-ignorant suggestions of non- sentient training tools, of which there are likely many - and if not, then give the pet product industry some time and they'll set you up without the need of exploiting and viscously slaughtering yet another cohort of nature's beautiful, fearful, loving creatures.\nAt the risk of dramatizing the reality, please do not approve this proposal - for the sake of our humanity.\n",

Penned hunting is incredibly cruel to the coyotes, foxes, and rabbits who are used as live bait and are chased and killed by packs of dogs. The dogs forced to participate can also suffer from injuries and death.\nIn addition to animal cruelty, penned hunting is a public health risk. The trade and transportation of wildlife are major contributors to the spread of disease and parasites, including zoonotic diseases that can infect wildlife, domestic animals, and humans.\nResearch is clear: more than four out of five Canadians are against hunting animals for sport. No other Canadian province allows penned dog hunting, and the cruel practice is unlawful in most of the United States.\nPlease do the right thing for animals and public health\u2014don\u2019t undo all of the progress made to phase out penned hunting facilities.

Even in 1997, the last time these areas were mistakenly approved, there was a growing concern about environmental degradation, habitat loss and increasing species extinction, which may have influenced the FWCA to reduce the inevitable outcry against its approvals by suggesting that these areas would be phased out eventually. Not only has this not taken place, but the current proposal is to lift restrictions on new areas and allow existing ones to have their licences transferred to new owners, instead of immediately banning the practice of \"training\" dogs to attack contained wildlife species , for \"sport\" or \"entertainment\",  revoking all existing licences and enacting severe penalties for anyone attempting to operate such atrocities in secret. Fox -hunting, dog-fighting, bear-baiting, hare-coursing, cock-fighting, etc, etc.  are rightly illegal, have no place in civilized societies and inevitably degrade\/ dehumanize  their supporters, as do these wildlife extermination enclosures; any dogs \"trained\" in them  would in any case be useless in the field, having become used to their prey served up and ready to devour as \"fast food\". Subsistence hunters, relying on sustainable use of wild resources, utilize dogs selected for their instinctive tracking and hunting abilities and should be encouraged to maintain the tradition of identifying and training these desirable qualities in the wild. When nuisance wildlife species need to be controlled, only recognized, humane methods should be employed, none that make use of artificially trained and exploited dogs.  It is deeply distressing to find government entities proposing unethical  changes secretively, without proper public consultation, in a cynical attempt to curry favour with amoral, anti-environmental, special interest groups; this must stop!\n",

        "comment":"I am appalled that this ministry is proposing to amend the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act, 1997 and associated regulations to allow for the issuance of licenses for new dog train and trial areas, and to allow the transfer of licenses.\nSurely in the 21st century, human beings can advance beyond recreational hunting and not partake of activities that cause untold trauma, fear, injury, pain and death to innocent animal life.   Humans already have an advantage over the intended prey because of high powered rifles and other killing mechanisms.  Humans do not also need tracking dogs.\nRecreational hunting and hunting dog competitions are of absolutely no benefit to society at large.    Neither benefits the prey that are terrified,  killed, or worse still, maimed and left to a painful death hours or days later.  With respect to the latter, Some hunters will undoubtedly try to justify tracking dogs by saying that if the hunter did not make a clean kill, the dog(s) will lead the hunter to the wounded animal where it would be \"humanely\" killed. That argument only deflects from the larger picture.  Why does anyone need to partake of recreational hunting in the 21st century?  We no longer live in a hunter\/gatherer state.\nThe Regulatory impact analysis is totally silent on the effect of confinement on the wildlife and of the very severe trials the dog training will undoubtedly cause.  Society is finally starting to acknowledge what real-life horses, mules, donkeys,  dogs, pigeons etc. were exposed to in WWI to benefit humans.  Each had no choice in the matter.  Let that \"enlightenment\" make you stop and consider the behaviour the present proposal  perpetuates.   Not a single coyote, fox, rabbit etc. confined for dog training would have a \"choice\".   How much harm will each confined animal have inflicted upon it?  Each deserves to live out its life in a natural state.\nI implore you not to proceed with this amendment.  Rather, I  encourage you to put an end to train and trial areas as soon as possible.\nRespectfully submitted\n",

This must have been done for a reason.  It must have been because they were deemed no longer necessary.  Perhaps the government of the day also recognized that penning wild animals in train and trial areas is inherently cruel. What has changed?  The information provided on the proposed amendment does not provide any rationale invalidating the original reasons for phasing out train and trial areas.\nAs far as I can tell, the hunting lobby, in particular OFAH, has advocated for more facilities to practice their sport, and the current government has listened.  And what is this \u201csport\u201d?  Having dogs chase wildlife that have no chance of really escaping and quite possibly being mauled to death.  This is not really sport.  This is sadism.\nThe real litmus test of this proposed legislation is to determine whether Ontario is better because of it. The answer is an emphatic \u201cNo!\u201d If passed, all this legislation would do is increase the cruelty visited upon wild animals and a few people, the ones advocating for this legislation, will get some enjoyment out of it.  Think about that.  Let it sink in. The legislation you are proposing will increase the suffering of wild animals so that a small number of people can enjoy themselves. Does that make any sense? Does this government want that as part of its legacy?  Nothing good will come from this legislation.\nA society can be judged by how it treats animals.  Most Ontarians would not want their government to increase animal cruelty, yet that is what this legislation would do.  Listen to what most Ontarians would tell you: stick to the original plan of the 1997 act and continue to phase out train and trial areas.  Make Ontario better, not worse.

I have seen the reddit post and 99% of the comments all expressed disdain and opposition to this, yet the premier is going to ignore the will of the people and put this through anyways. He has lost my vote and I feel nothing but deep shame for having supported him in the past. I'll be sure to stop his re-election. He doesn't deserve to hold this office. Below is a comment that resonates with how I feel about such compounds of animal cruelty.\nThese facilities should be illegal. This is animal cruelty plain and simple. Disgusting that anyone would consider this a 'sport'. I can't torture and kill a rabbit or coyote on my property without animal cruelty charges (and I would never ever want to) so why are these facilities allowed to exist and possibly expand.\nSociety should do everything possible to protect wild animals, they have a place within the ecosystem and should never be subjected to this kind of torture, for the amusement of humans. If you want your dog to chase coyotes or rabbits away from your crops, they can be trained without resorting to torture of animals, whether wild 'caught' or raised for this purposed (a whole other area of extreme animal torture).\nNaturalist experts and environmental diversity experts should be consulted and they would explain why this practice is as outdated as dog fighting or bull running and should be banned.\nSociety needs to evolve to be more compassionate and accepting of the rich diversity of our ecosystems and relegate the torture of animals for human pleasure in the distant past. We are better than this and our laws should reflect this.\n",

        "comment":"I am writing to express concerns about the proposed amendment to the Fish and Wildlife Act, 1997. The amendment will allow the expansion of licenses for train and trialing facilities in Ontario. Train and Trialing facilities purchase coyotes from trap lines to use as bait in enclosed pens for hound dogs to chase for training. At trial's multiple hound dogs can hunt down coyotes, which allow a coyote be trapped along the fence line and killed by mauling. These facilities can also use foxes and hares. I do support hunting, I do not support using animals as bait to teach hunting in an enclosed area, no matter the size, or hides provided. Train and Trialing is a form of blood sport, and it has no place in modern dog training or trials.\nTrafficking wildlife for bait sport was outlawed in 1997 in Ontario, with the grandfathering of 60 facilities with the goal of shutting down this industry due to animals in distress and animal\u2019s dying cruel deaths. Today only 27 facilities remain, and I have been unable to find information available on the conditions, regulations, inspections or welfare\/ disease protocols. These facilities are reported as being about 100-200 acres in size, with hides that the coyotes can hide in if they are able to outrun the hounds. All coyotes used in penning were sourced from trapping lines to be transported and housed at these facilities. Foxes may be purchased from breeding operations, but still suffer the same fate as their wild caught counter-parts.\nI have been a professional dog trainer for the last 15 years and have trained working breeds in protection, scent detection and obedience. Coyote\/ fox penning is not supported by many reputable hunters in Canada and other parts of the world, especially in the UK where mounted hound hunts pursue wild foxes without violating the fair chase principle. Nor is it supported by most dog trainers or dog sport enthusiasts. Breeding wild animals in captivity does not make them less wild or deserving of respect and protection from cruelty.\nCoyote's are relatives of dogs, and they have strong social family groups. While the coyote groups in Ontario can sustain their population despite hunting, that does not mean it is okay to kill individual animals in such a way. Trapping and trafficking wildlife to be bait in sport is the definition of disrespect and animal cruelty of wildlife.\nDogs have amazing olfactory ability (scenting) and can learn to smell and detect coyotes for hunting in open season, without using captured coyotes as live bait. Train and Trialing is lazy dog training. It is also a bait sport, which disregards the distress, suffering and death of the bait animals.\nCoyote penning is also being banned in the United States for similar reasons:\n1) Coyotes and foxes are vectors for rabies and a public health risk exists when they are trafficked and confined\n2) Coyote penning is not hunting, and reputable hunters do not trap prey in a confined area to hunt as it violates the principle of fair chase\n3) Hounds are stronger, faster and bigger than coyotes, while hunting in the wild allows the principle of fair chase, penning violates this. So much so that many reputable hunters in the US have spoken up against it. Wild animals do not belong in pens to be killed by domestic animals in such a horrific way.\nAlso consider\n-Injured coyotes from trapping cannot run fast to get to the hides (all coyotes captured for penning have been caught on live traps)\n-Pregnant coyotes cannot run fast to get to the hides\n-This would be classified as dog fighting and be illegal if you swapped the species from coyotes to dogs, and coyotes are apart of the canine family and have rich social lives\n-You do not need live bait to teach hounds to track scent; they are born with this ability from years of genetic selective breeding. You do not need to teach a hound to hunt, you only need to expose them to the scent they will hunt, and you do not need live animals for this.\n-Why is the ministry interested in bringing this back when the government outlawed it in 1997?\n-How much money is involved in selling captured coyotes, because in the United States it is a lot because so many animals die in these competitions and facilities that the demand is high\n-How much money will the ministry be making from this industry?\n-Allowing wild animals to be captured and torn apart alive is disgusting\n-Legalizing animal abuse to prevent it from going underground is not the right solution, prosecute them and pursue them, big fines, big jail time\n-Don't normalize animal abuse this would be illegal for domestic animals and live stock to meet this end, wild life has less protection because it is not expected for them to be caught and kept this way for bait\n-There are many documented studies showing a link between animal cruelty and domestic violence, why is the ministry so eager to support this group of people who are passionate about expanding this \"sport\"?\nOne concern listed in an interview shares that the government is worried about the sport going underground. While this likely already occurs, one route is to set the fines high, and include jail time. We must also ask, when would we take this approach with anything else? If we were worried about dog fighting going underground, would we legalize it? No, we would continue to prosecute those who disrespect life and fine them\/ charge them accordingly. Coyotes are relatives of dogs, and while the space where the hunt occurs is large, a coyote is no match for a pack of hound dogs, who will find them easily, once cornered on the fence line, the coyote will be torn apart alive, this is no different than dog fighting. Most disturbing is it involves wild animals that have been captured for bait. Undercover investigations of similar facilities in the United States led to 16 people being charged because of inhumane practices, conditions and animal abuse.\nPlease reconsider, these facilities were outlawed in 1997 for a reason, and the grandfathering was to help wind down the end of an era. There are plenty of other ways to be an avid hunter, outdoorsmen and dog trainer, then being involved in blood sport. The argument that pens keep hunting dogs safer and the public safer, is also not a justification for this type of animal abuse. When you hunt in the wild use an e-collar and hunt away from major roads. Nothing justifies this.\n",

The creation  of more train and trial areas allows those in the sport more places to run hounds, which in turn allows for more down times in pens, which means less stress on game. In short, the more places to run, the less running in the same place consistently. Further, train and trial areas allow increased safety for hounds and participants. The sport of beagling has been around since the 40's if not earlier and it will continue. Do we not want those in it and their hounds to be as safe as possible? How does standing in the way of that help anyone?  As for the game; I have seen the care that is taken to ensure the game are respected and taken care of; strict down times for running, feeding, not overpopulating a pen, addressing flea etc. There is no reason to stand in the way of a proposal to have more pens created when standing in the way risks not increasing safety for humans and hounds, and does not lead to decreasing stress on game. The sport WILL continue. Given that, why would anyone not want to support something that would increase safety and decrease stress on game?\n",

More training and trialing areas in Ontario will give hunters and sporting dog community members better access to these areas, giving them more opportunities to create well-trained dogs in safely enclosed and regulated areas, ensuring they have the ability to identify the correct game species when it comes to time to hunt.\nFurthermore, more training and trialing areas also contribute to local economies where they exist through hunter and competition participant travel and visiting expenses and provide a small business opportunity to people.\nLastly, getting outdoors to train your dog at a training and trialing area is a great way to be active and spend some quality time with your dog, something that can be very beneficial for physical and mental health. Not only is it great for the handler, but being able to give your dog the opportunity to exercise and work on their skills also makes for a happier dog with a higher quality of life.\nTraining and trialing areas are important to the sporting dog community and to Ontario\u2019s hunting heritage. For these reasons and more, I support the proposal. Thank you for the opportunity to provide my comments.\n",

        "comment":"The provincial government is proposing an amendment to the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act (FWCA) that will encourage animal cruelty through the use of hunting dogs.\n\u2060\nThere are currently 24 enclosed spaces in Ontario, called train and trial areas, that are dedicated to training dogs to hunt species of wildlife. The victims of this practice - like timid coyotes, frightened foxes, peaceful cottontails - can be legally trapped and taken from their homes. Torn away from their families, these animals are then forced into pens to live the rest of their lives experiencing intense fear, trauma and extreme stress as they are horrifically chased down by dogs on a regular basis. \u2060\n\u2060\nIn 1997, this archaic practice was set to be phased out when the FWCA declared no new licences would be issued and that existing licences could not be transferred.\u2060\n\u2060\nBut now, under the proposed change, more train and trial areas would be allowed to open and existing ones could be transferred to new owners. Rather than being phased out, these unspeakable areas will become more prevalent. More innocent victims will be stolen from the wild and forced into a life that no living being deserves to live. \u2060\n",

It is already known that wildlife have a difficult time living in areas densely populated with humans, based on the number of deaths caused by humans such as vehicle accidents. So the removal of them to be used for hunting will greatly impact their populations and cause an imbalance in the food chain.

The province was absolutely on the right track phasing out this type of animal cruelty and we cannot open the door to allowing more of these facilities to operate.\nI am frankly concerned about the type of people that would take enjoyment in this activity. In a world that is becoming increasingly violent, we should not provide a legal opportunity to take part in sadistic activities. People that cause violence against other people often start by causing violence against animals.\nIf someone was seeking a permit to carry out these activities where cats or dogs were hunted, people would be outraged and it would never be permitted. Wildlife feel the same pain and fear that wildlife do.  I am not against hunting. I grew up in a hunting family. Our dogs were taught to retrieve game that would be later eaten.

We do not terrorize wildlife simply for the sake of killing it.\nI encourage you to seriously consider what repealing the phasing out of these pens says about Ontario as a progressive province.

The law was changed in 1997 because it was acknowledged that it was a barbaric, inhumane thing to do and by issuing licenses, the province was condoning being cruel to animals.\nIssuing licences for new dog train and trial areas and allowing the transfer of licences should not be permitted.

The vast majority of Ontario citizens would be dramatically opposed to this type of regulatory amendment (and especially if they were able to actually see what happens in these type of places). Please stop pushing through reg changes that only benefit a handful of people while devastating the others involved. This type if regulatory proposal demonstrates a complete inability of this government to show that they are willing and wanting to improve Ontario. But rather demonstrates a continued approach that the Ford government has to quietly push through changes that benefit a select group of people.\nInstead of wasting time, money and resources on regulatory changes like this, please do work on changes that the people of this province actually want to see done, such as improved animal welfare laws in the province, improved farming laws and enforcement in this province, PROTECTING our environment rather than destroying it, etc.\nCould you please outline to me what work the Ford government has done to improve animal protections or any kind in this province?\nCould you also please let me know what research, consultation, review, etc was done by this government to look into why this practice was initially limited\/restricted back in the 1990s?\nCould you please let me know what level of inspection, surveillance, enforcement is currently being done in these types of facilities?\nThank you for your time reviewing my comments and I am very much looking forward to a response. Quiet saddened to see that the Ford government is wasting time and money on this reg change when this province has actual problems that need to be fixed. Very disappointed.\nSincerely,\nHeather\n",

Causes undo and extreme suffering to wildlife (rabbits, foxes, coyote) which is inhumane. This is a negative which is not mentioned in the proposal.\n2.  Coyote hunters already allow their trained, wildlife killer dogs to run free on rural private property at will, once they are released. The hunters have no control over the dogs, and it is impossible to control where the dogs go. On my private property, I want to protect these creatures (coyote, fox and rabbit) and enjoy them, and co exist with them. Coyote hunter\u2019s dogs, take this right I have, as a property owner and a citizen of Ontario away from me. A coyote, fox, rabbit could be killed on my property by these trained dogs and there is nothing I can do about it. This is not right!\n3.  There are wildlife conservation groups that have become more vocal in the recent years, who are also opposed. Their mandates are to save and protect these animals. They would rescue an injured coyote, fox, rabbit, rehabilitate it and get it healthy again and release it back into the wild. To think that these creatures would then be subjected to this torture after being rehabilitated and released is heart breaking. This proposal and the Wildlife conservationist are at opposite ends and working against each other. So much time and effort is put in by the volunteers of the wildlife conservation groups, often on a shoestring, and driven by a love of animals. This proposal would make their job so much harder.\nExamples of wildlife groups that care for these creatures are:  Toronto Wildlife Centre, Coyote Watch Canada, Aspen Valley Wildlife Sanctuary, Hobbitsee Wildlife Refuge, all Humane Society.\nTheir work has to be validated and respected, and this proposal does not do that.\n4.  This practice of training dogs for hunting should be eliminated, rather than steps taken to revamp it.\n5.

I find it so fascinating that the current Ontario Government is so favourable about the promotion and implementation of various hunting \"sports\".\nI literally cannot fathom that any decent human being would be EXCITED to reverse the ban on dog hunting and trialling, which is an illegal practice across the world. Coyotes are already targeted in local Facebook groups, with people very eager to go out and get rid of the problem. We don't need to add to the hate and vitriol that will stem from allowing these hunting practices.\nDog hunting and trail hunting have been proven to be cruel, unethical practices that endanger animal welfare, human beings, and wildlife. These activities demonstrate little respect for the animals' lives or the environment and have no place in civil society. We must raise awareness to end such practices, encourage non-violent alternatives to pursuing entertainment, and build a better future for all living creatures.\nThe chase and pursuit by a pack of dogs can cause significant stress on animals, driving them beyond their limits, experiencing panic and fear (not naturally) and leading to prolonged, agonizing deaths, especially when they are trapped in a pen.\nThe dogs in these activities are often subjected to inhumane living conditions, forced to travel long distances in crates and endure harsh training methods. As it is considered a \u201csport\u201d the dogs lack proper socialization and do not receive adequate attention. Many hounds are bred for hunting purposes only, and once they love their value, they are often abandoned or put down.\nI find it completely alarming and worrisome that our Minister of Natural Resources and Forestry would be boosting a reverse ban that is actually detrimental to our own natural fauna (red foxes, coyotes, rabbits, etc.) Where is the protection for wildlife?\nThe fact that it was even a thought makes me so angry! Ontario is being destroyed, and our government seems to delight in watching it burn.\nAbsolutely no care or concern for our wildlife in Ontario, abhorrent behaviour.

I strongly believe that these compounds must be phased out which is the intent of the existing legislation which prevents establishment of new compounds and transfer of licenses for existing ones.\nFoxes and Coyotes are intelligent animals with a complex social structure.  I have seen one of these compounds and they clearly involve cruelty to animals in that they take these wild animals out of their natural environment and subject them to extreme stress by:\n-\tTrapping them to capture them for transfer to the compound \u2013 they suffer while being trapped\n-\tConfining them within a fenced-in area which is contrary to their nature where they are intended to roam freely in search of food, providing for their families and interacting socially with other members of their species\n-\tRepeatedly subjecting them to the stress of being chased by dogs without their usual ability to escape since they are confined to a fenced in area\n-\tBeing confined with no escape route increases the probability that they will be caught by dogs and torn apart while still alive \u2013 barbaric to say the least!\nI have had the privilege of watching a fox couple raise their kits near my parents barn years ago.  They have many similarities to human parents.  For example, when they were exhausted by the kits, one of the parents would go to a spot and dig up a dead groundhog and give it to the kits to play with so they could get a break.  Then when the kits were done with it, they buried it again in the same place for next time.  While they were growing up, it was clear to see the different personalities emerging in the kits, just like human children.\nAll wildlife is currently being subjected to additional stress due to climate change and also more and more encroachment on their natural habitat by development such as strip development along roads and subdivision housing in rural areas.  To submit these intelligent animals to additional suffering in these compounds instead of letting them live their own lives as nature intended is beyond appalling.  Given the supposed commitment to \u201cSustainability\u201d by our provincial government, this proposed change in legislation is the ultimate in hypocrisy.\nI live in a rural area where many people hunt.  While I am not against hunting in a fair manner where animals are not confined and have the possibility to escape from hunters and dogs, I am very much against these compounds where wild animals are subjected to so much stress as listed above.  I note that many of the hunters in rural areas are also against these compounds for the same reason \u2013 they violate their ethics regarding \u201cfair game\u201d.\nI\u2019m sure you know that hunters make up a very small minority of people in this province, and given that many of them do not support these compounds, it is clear that the VAST majority of Ontario residents would be appalled and outraged by these compounds if they knew about them.  Most do not know of their existence and to learn that the Ministry is considering changing legislation to allow more of these instead of phasing them out at a time when sustainability, climate change and environmental harm is so high on everyone\u2019s agenda is just out of touch with majority opinion and unbelievable!  Why would the Ministry consider making these changes to pander to such a small minority of our population?   That is NOT democracy!!!\n",

The current existence of 24 enclosed train and trial areas in Ontario, where animals are trapped and taken from their habitats, is already unacceptable. These timid coyotes, frightened foxes, and peaceful cottontails are subjected to a life of intense fear, trauma, and extreme stress as they are relentlessly pursued by dogs.\nIt is disheartening to see that in 1997, there were plans to phase out this archaic practice, with no new licenses being issued and existing licenses prohibited from being transferred. However, the proposed change would allow for the opening of more train and trial areas and the transfer of existing ones to new owners. This means that these unspeakable practice will not only continue to exist but also become more prevalent. What a huge throwback.\nWe must take a stand against the inhumane treatment of wildlife before it's too late. More innocent animals will be torn away from their families and forced to endure a life that no living being deserves. It is crucial that we prioritize the well-being and protection of these creatures and work towards more compassionate and ethical approaches to wildlife conservation.\nIn addition to being cruel and archaic, the proposed practice is also elitist. It promotes favoritism towards the privileged class, further deepening social divides. By expanding the train and trial areas and allowing the transfer of existing ones, this practice reinforces the notion that certain individuals have the right to exploit and subject innocent animals to suffering for their own entertainment. It perpetuates a culture of entitlement where the lives and well-being of wildlife are disregarded.\nFurthermore, the proliferation of firearms associated with this practice poses a significant threat to the general safety of the community. The increased presence of firearms can potentially facilitate more crimes against people, jeopardizing the overall security of our society. This is an alarming consequence that should not be overlooked. We must stand against such practices that perpetuate inequality, promote cruelty, and compromise the well-being of both animals and humans alike.\nIf dog-fighting has been illegal in Canada since 1892, and rightfully so, it raises an important question: What is the difference between dog-fighting and the enclosed train and trial areas for hunting in Ontario? The suffering endured by animals in both cases is undeniably cruel and unacceptable.\nThis is a clear case of causing unnecessary suffering to animals, which is explicitly deemed a crime under the Criminal Code.\nThe fundamental difference between dog-fighting and these enclosed areas may lie in the explicit intent and format of the activities. However, the underlying cruelty and harm inflicted upon animals are strikingly similar. Both practices exploit animals for human pleasure and entertainment, disregarding their well-being and violating their basic rights.\nI hope the names of the politicians that vote in favor this vexatious emend will be made public.

Especially for the province to make a few bucks off of 50-60 licenses.\nAnd the way in which these animals will be obtained seem exceptionally suspect, especially the rabbits. Will they be taken from Humane Societies that have received surrendered pets? Unconscionable!\nAbsolutely. Disgusting.\n",

As a concerned citizen and advocate for animal welfare, I firmly believe that such practices are not only ethically unacceptable but also pose a threat to the well-being and conservation of our precious wildlife.\nThe proposal to enclose areas on private land for the purpose of training dogs in blood sport skills, such as picking up scent trails, tracking, and pursuing game, is nothing short of barbaric. The captive wildlife, including cottontail, snowshoe hare, red fox, and coyote, should never be subjected to such inhumane treatment. By confining these animals in fenced areas, the proposal not only denies them their natural freedom but also disrupts the ecological balance and natural behaviors essential for their survival.\nFurthermore, the use of these enclosed areas to conduct hunting dog competitions, commonly known as \"trialing,\" is equally troubling. These blood sports competitions promote a disregard for the welfare of wildlife and contribute to a culture that glorifies the pursuit and capture of animals for sport. Encouraging such activities is not only morally wrong but also undermines the efforts made by conservation organizations and ethical hunters to promote responsible and sustainable wildlife management.\nI urge the Ministry of Natural Resources and Wildlife of Ontario to reconsider this blood sports proposal and instead focus on promoting humane and sustainable practices that protect the welfare of wildlife and preserve our natural heritage. We must prioritize the conservation and well-being of our wildlife, recognizing their intrinsic value and the vital roles they play in maintaining healthy ecosystems.\nI respectfully request that you take immediate action to halt any plans to establish these enclosed areas for training and trial purposes and engage in a comprehensive consultation process with relevant stakeholders, including wildlife experts, animal welfare organizations, and concerned citizens. Together, we can work towards a future that respects the rights and dignity of all living beings and ensures the preservation of our wildlife for generations to come.\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will give due consideration to these concerns and take appropriate steps to prevent the implementation of this barbaric proposal.\n",

I am firmly against the proposed use of wildlife - to be placed in captivity and used to train dogs for hunting.\n2) Since 1997, the Mike Harris PC government, aimed to phase out these train and trail areas.  I request that the current PC government, follow through with the intent of initial actions (now 25 years old) and eliminate the licenses for the remaining 24 dog train and trail pen areas - and disallow any additional dog train and trial hunting pen facilities and their use of wildlife (held captive).\n3)  Penned dog train and trail areas cause extreme stress and cruelty to wildlife, including red foxes, coyotes, and rabbits - they are used as live bait for training. To be clear, this unethical and cruel practice should be stopped, not expanded.\n4) Across most of North America, penned dog train and trail facilities are illegal.  Ontario should not go backwards and allow practices that support animal cruelty.\n5) The original phase-out period for existing facilities, has been ridiculously long (now 25 years) and the current proposal to now maintain and expand these unethical facilities, is disturbing.

How about the fact that these wild animals feel fear and pain and are extremely stressed while being trapped, transported and confined in these compounds?  How about the fact that they will likely be killed by dogs, maybe ripped apart while they are still alive for the purpose of training the dogs to do the same thing outside the compound in their natural environment?  How about the fact that their offspring may starve to death after their parent has been abducted to be taken to one of these compounds?  Do officials at MNR really have \u201cno concerns\u201d about the cruelty to animals that these compounds inflict?\nI also note that provincial legislation prohibits citizens from confining a wild animal longer than 24 hours if for ex. they are trying to heal an injured animal.  But that same ministry has \u201cno concerns\u201d with trapping and confining wild animals for the purpose of having them chased and killed by dogs because they have \u201csustainable populations\u201d.  So\u2026 its ok to confine a wild animal for the purpose of chasing and killing it so dogs are trained to do the same thing to other wild animals in their natural habitat, but it\u2019s not ok for a citizen to confine it for the purpose of healing it?  really???  What is the mandate of MNR?  I thought it was to protect wildlife and natural resources.\nThe vast majority of citizens of this province - including many hunters - find these training compounds unacceptable.  It is the duty of our government to uphold democratic values and respect the opinions of the majority rather than pandering to a few proponents of these compounds who must have successfully lobbied MNR officials for this regulatory change to be proposed at all.\n",

        "comment":"The FWCA's stated purpose is to ensure the conservation, protection, and sustainable management of fish and wildlife in Ontario. It provides the legal framework for regulating activities related to hunting, fishing, trapping, and the protection of species at risk.  Train and trial areas in Ontario are in direct conflict with the FWCA.  There are a number of concerns raised by train and trial areas which I will outline below.\nCruelty and unnecessary suffering: Training dogs to hunt wildlife can lead to unnecessary suffering and cruelty towards the targeted animals. The use of dogs can result in injuries, stress, and often death for the wildlife being pursued. This goes against the principle of minimizing harm to animals and treating them with respect.\nConservation concerns: While proponents of such areas argue that hunting can help manage wildlife populations, it's important to consider the potential negative impact on conservation efforts. Training dogs to hunt wildlife in dedicated areas might disrupt natural habitats and alter the balance of ecosystems. This can have unintended consequences, including potential declines in specific species or imbalances within local wildlife populations.\nLack of fair chase: The concept of \"fair chase\" is central to ethical hunting practices. It promotes the idea that hunting should involve a fair and reasonable pursuit, providing animals with a reasonable chance to escape. In dedicated training areas, where animals may be confined or have limited escape options, the concept of fair chase may be compromised.\nSpecies preservation: Some wildlife species may be endangered, threatened, or protected by law. Training dogs to hunt these species, even in dedicated areas, could contribute to their further decline and jeopardize efforts to protect and preserve their populations.\nAlternatives for training: With advancements in technology and training methods, there are alternative ways to train hunting dogs that do not involve live wildlife. Artificial scents, training aids, and simulated scenarios can be used instead, minimizing the harm inflicted on animals while still preparing dogs for hunting activities.\nPublic perception and reputation: The existence of dedicated training areas for hunting dogs can generate negative public perception, leading to reputational risks for hunting communities. It may reinforce negative stereotypes associated with hunting practices and make it harder to promote responsible and ethical hunting as a legitimate activity.\nFocus on non-consumptive wildlife activities: Encouraging alternatives to hunting, such as wildlife photography, birdwatching, or nature observation, can provide enjoyment and connection with nature without causing harm to animals. Promoting these non-consumptive activities aligns with the principles of wildlife conservation and animal welfare.\nIn summary, arguments against the legality and ethics of \"train and trial\" areas in Ontario for training dogs to hunt wildlife revolve around concerns of animal cruelty, conservation implications, fair chase principles, species preservation, availability of alternative training methods, public perception, and promoting non-consumptive wildlife activities as alternatives.\n",

Entrapment.\nI use to be very proud to be Canadian - to live in Ontario, be from Toronto, I was proud to let people know. I can\u2019t however support that anymore. We have some of the worst animal protection laws in the western world. Activists are putting their lives at risk and have lost their lives in order to expose cruelty and promote protection for animals. I\u2019m so sad that someone from where I live is able to sit down and say that it\u2019s OK to trap animals to have dogs tear them apart. I hate how human nature needs to inject itself and every natural resource we have. We should celebrate the fact that we have wildlife. We should celebrate the fact that we live in an environment that supports their habitat. Instead, we continue to destroy it and for those that have survived we know are going to allow them to be captured and killed in a pen.\nI think it\u2019s truly ironic, that we banned a breed of dogs (pitbull) because of this exact behavior. Even though it was a weak law and there\u2019s no real evidence to support it. But then years later, we are able to pass a law that promotes dogs, being violent towards other sentient beings.  If this passes will Ontario then pass a protective law for these trained dogs when they decide to attack other dogs that look like foxes or cats that look like raccoons. I can already see the headlines of one of these trained dogs, killing another small dog, and then we crucify  this dog based on our own actions on our own bills that we pass. I don\u2019t understand any of it.\nIt makes me sad to think that this would happen - and that Canadians above all others would promote the destruction of wildlife.\n",

        "comment":"I find this proposal very disturbing. I do not feel that holding wildlife \u201ccaptive\u201d for the purposes of training hunting dogs to be humane or an acceptable practise in 2023. Who will be monitoring each of these independent facilities to confirm that the captive wildlife will not be harmed? It\u2019s mentioned that the dogs will be kept at a safe distance from the wildlife. That seems a ludicrous statement and there is no supporting evidence to state how this will be achieved.\nAs with anything so loosely written and with the low likelihood of being able to monitor these facilities, I see plenty of room for rampant abuse. To me this means that captive wildlife, sentient beings who feel pain and fear, will be traumatized, physically harmed and will be denied the means to escape. Under the province of Ontario I thought I understood that it is an offence to cause or permit stress to an animal.\nThis proposal opens the door and makes it acceptable and much more likely that these unfortunate animals who have absolutely no say in what is happening to them, will be placed in situations causing them extreme stress both physically and mentally, as they try hopelessly to escape a fenced in environment. There is no guarantee that these animals, sentient beings, will not be physically harmed, or torn to shreds, once a pack of hunting dogs is \u201caccidentally\u201d released upon them. There is no onus on the owners of these facilities to ensure that wildlife is not maimed, and killed by trained hunting dogs.\nPlease do not allow this proposal to proceed. At some basic level those of you involved in advocating for this must know that this opens the door to abuse and inhumane and cruel outcomes. This is 2023, not 1923. This is a step backwards and is extremely disappointing to see.\n",

Training dogs how to hunt wildlife in an enclosed space is not fair to the animals that are trapped and relocated to these enclosed spaces. They will be constantly in fear and chased at all different times of the day unable to live out a natural life. The dogs that are being trained are just that, being TRAINED. Therefore, they are not skilled in their abilities and the wildlife will suffer when the dogs are killing them slowly. Shooting an unsuspecting animal dead with one shot is quick and relatively painless for the creature, while I do not agree with hunting at least it is a skilled pursuit. Having the animal chased and tormented by another living animal is cruel and unnecessary. This practice must be stopped, and the only way to do that is to lower the number of enclosed training areas, not increase them. I am asking for the members deciding the fate of this proposal to think not only about the well-being of innocent wildlife, but also the well-being and safety of hunting dogs. The dogs can get hurt while pursing a coyote or fox and this may result in psychological and bodily harm of the dog. There has been evidence of hunting dogs in threes enclosed pens being impaled by sticks while chasing down their prey. All in all, this is an inhumane, cruel, and unnecessary \u201csport\u201d to satisfy human wants and desires without any regard for the well-being of wildlife AND of the hunting dogs themselves. This is not nature or natural. This is not the circle of life. These dogs are not hunting for their survivals. This is purely for humane entertainment.

Let's permit those aging license holders to pass into history and bid them a not-so-fond adieu. Have we not moved beyond such barbaric practices? This falls squarely into all the other cruel and exploitive ways in which humans abuse both domestic animals and wildlife. \"Canned hunting,\" anyone? That humans indulge their taste for animal cruelty in countless ways is not news; that this government would facilitate expanding those ways\u2014for money\u2014should not be either.\nDO NOT expand or permit more of these licenses. This activity is positively mediaeval, the 21st-century equivalent of bear-baiting. Is this who we are?\nThe fact that your \"Proposal details\" section includes such statements as \"certain wildlife (i.e. cottontail, snowshoe hare, red fox or coyote) are kept captive for the purposes of teaching dogs hunting skills such as picking up scent trails, tracking, and pursuing game at a safe distance,\" [\"safe distance\"! Safe for whom?] or \"These species have sustainable populations and there are no concerns with limited take of small numbers\" [i.e., there are lots of rabbits, so it's perfectly O.K. if a few of them get torn apart for fun and profit?] or \"Coyote and red fox may be obtained through lawful trapping activity\" [so first they have to survive the terror and suffering of being \"lawfully trapped,\" after which they are pursued\u2014hopefully just once\u2014by hunting dogs?] says it all.\nAnd how about those \"strict regulatory standards\" that require: \"standards of care for wildlife\" [\"care\"!!] and \"minimum standards for facility size and areas of wildlife refuge.\" Again, do they see no irony in using the term \"refuge\"??? How do the managers ensure that every prey animal makes it to an \"escape unit\"? What of the animals that do, but die of the terror and stress of the chase?\nI note that there is no mention of what happens to the wildlife at the end of these competition hunts. Perhaps they are returned to their pen for another day of torture tomorrow?\nOther telling quotes: \"The proposal would support the continued operation of licensed dog train and trial areas and offer benefits to persons who use dogs to hunt or track wildlife, or who run their dogs in trialing competitions, as they would continue to have access to dedicated space for dog training and trialing to avoid conflicts with other land and resource users\" [yes, \"benefits to persons,\" indeed; this is seriously regressive thinking] and most ludicrous of all, \"provide a dedicated space for training where dogs and wildlife are contained and safe\"\u2014\"safe\"!!!\u2014reveals that this whole enterprise is just a variation on canned hunting. It subjects captured wildlife to the ultimate cruelty: being hunted down and killed for the sick enjoyment of those with no need to feed their families\u2014or even their dogs!\u2014who pay for this \"entertainment.\"\nLet's ask Marineland how that's working out for them.\nIf the 24 existing establishments don't want animal-cruelty activists camped at their gates protesting the \"trialing competitions\" and the \"off-season exercises,\" I would strongly suggest you not pass this outrageously archaic bill. Those of us who actually care for the environment and respect wildlife are watching.\nThank you.\n",

I would like to see stats to see an increase in demand. Likely the reason the number of new licenses issued before as this was seen as cruel. Should you not be creating a proposal that protects wildlife? Also, could you place a limit on the number of foxes and coyotes that can be trapped?

This section of the legislation proposes to allow an unethical, inherently inhumane practice to grow: the capture of wild foxes and coyotes and purchased rabbits to be kept captive so dogs may be trained to hunt them. This should have been stopped years ago - not a new proposal to continue and increase this practice. When dogs are killed for sport, it is frequently regarded as cruel due to the injuries and pain they sustain. Hunting with dogs destroys habitats, animal families, and endangers and kills young animals, leaving them vulnerable. This bill reinstates how disposable our wildlife is and intensifies the increase of inhumane practices and a total disregard of property owner rights in Ontario.\nWildlife should never be taken from their natural environments and held captive by hunters. Hunting pens are inhumane and unethical. The use of wild animals for bait to train hunting dogs is deplorable. Such activities and facilities also go against the doctrine of holding wildlife in trust for the public; to allow a special interest group to influence policy regarding wildlife and their use is an affront to this doctrine and reinforce the lack of  trust in this Ministry and government to act impartially, and for the benefit of all residents.\nThe Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry\u2019s proposed changes demonstrate the complete disrespect towards wild animals by catering to the requests of hunters (the ministry\u2019s notice states: \u201cOver time, the ministry has received requests for changes to allow dog train and trial areas to continue to persist, including allowing for licence transfers in response to aging licence holders, as well as new licences to be issued.\u201d) Wild animals such as foxes, coyotes, and rabbits are captured and held in captivity only to be subjected to cruelty, abuse, and suffering through the training and trialing of hunting dogs. These archaic facilities have no place in today\u2019s society. This Ministry should be charged with wildlife abuse and reinforcing inhumane treatment to our wildlife. This is not hunting - three is no good moral and prudent practices when using dogs, nor any semblance of fair chase.\nEvery year there are reports of trespassing, damage to crops, property, and livestock, and allegations of animal cruelty based on the current rules. The proposal to increase the numbers is immoral and an afront to all of the citizens in Ontario. Problems are not reported because they are not addressed through the existing legal channels - this Ministry can't even do its own research into the current issues and fix the existing problems. Its seems that property owners in Ontario with posted signs  - \"no trespassing\", \"no hunting\" are of little consequences to this Ministry and they have no rights. The province of roadside killing and lack of enforcement and fines that are meaningful.\n",

This is unacceptable in today's society and instead of allowing new applications, the province's existing 24 facilities should be closed effective immediately.\n",

All of the supporting materials I've read highlight the economic benefit of allowing these training facilities to continue and expand. As well, the inclusion of this proposal in the \"Less red tape, stronger economy act\" suggests the real purpose of this bill is to make money, with little regard to the welfare implications on the wildlife forced to participate in this antiquated practice. I strongly oppose the proposal to continue the use of training and trial areas in Ontario. The phasing out of this practice should be allowed to continue until this is no longer an activity that is condoned in the province.\n",

I strongly oppose this inhumane treatment of wildlife.\u2060\n\u2060\nThere are currently 24 enclosed spaces in Ontario, called train and trial areas, that are dedicated to training dogs to hunt species of wildlife. The victims of this practice - like timid coyotes, frightened foxes, peaceful cottontails - can be legally trapped and taken from their homes. Torn away from their families, these animals are then forced into pens to live the rest of their lives experiencing intense fear, trauma and extreme stress as they are horrifically chased down by dogs on a regular basis. \u2060\n\u2060\nIn 1997, this archaic practice was set to be phased out when the FWCA declared no new licences would be issued and that existing licences could not be transferred.\u2060\n\u2060\nBut now, under the proposed change, more train and trial areas would be allowed to open and existing ones could be transferred to new owners.

I am not a fan of hunting, but do respect that many individuals love that pursuit - and I know that many of those individuals love nature, simply in a different way than myself.\nHunting an animal in the wild at least provides a slim chance for escape by wildlife.  To be hunted - repeatedly - in a fenced in area would be an awful and sad life for these wonderful creatures, previously wild and free, who are simply trying to live their lives.  Instead they get captured, relocated to these pens and repeatedly abused.  I gather the pens are constructed with places for animals to escape, but can imagine some will get caught and injured or killed - or at best be terrified as dogs try to chase them down.\nTo think that my province is considering endorsing and encouraging this type of shameful activity is embarrassing.  As I understand it we are unique in doing this as a jurisdiction in North America.  We should try and be a leader in maintaining and respecting the environment and the wildlife that lives there.  The course of action being contemplated takes us in the opposite direction.\nPlease reconsider.\nRespectfully,\nA proud resident of Ontario who is trying to maintain pride in his province\n",

As a concerned citizen and advocate for animal welfare, I firmly believe that such practices are not only ethically unacceptable but also pose a threat to the well-being and conservation of our precious wildlife.\nThe proposal to enclose areas on private land for the purpose of training dogs in blood sport skills, such as picking up scent trails, tracking, and pursuing game, is nothing short of barbaric. The captive wildlife, including cottontail, snowshoe hare, red fox, and coyote, should never be subjected to such inhumane treatment. By confining these animals in fenced areas, the proposal not only denies them their natural freedom but also disrupts the ecological balance and natural behaviors essential for their survival.\nFurthermore, the use of these enclosed areas to conduct hunting dog competitions, commonly known as \"trialing,\" is equally troubling. These blood sports competitions promote a disregard for the welfare of wildlife and contribute to a culture that glorifies the pursuit and capture of animals for sport. Encouraging such activities is not only morally wrong but also undermines the efforts made by conservation organizations and ethical hunters to promote responsible and sustainable wildlife management.\nI urge the Ministry of Natural Resources and Wildlife of Ontario to reconsider this blood sports proposal and instead focus on promoting humane and sustainable practices that protect the welfare of wildlife and preserve our natural heritage. We must prioritize the conservation and well-being of our wildlife, recognizing their intrinsic value and the vital roles they play in maintaining healthy ecosystems.\nI respectfully request that you take immediate action to halt any plans to establish these enclosed areas for training and trial purposes and engage in a comprehensive consultation process with relevant stakeholders, including wildlife experts, animal welfare organizations, and concerned citizens. Together, we can work towards a future that respects the rights and dignity of all living beings and ensures the preservation of our wildlife for generations to come.\nThank you for your attention to this matter.

All it is is sanctioned animal cruelty.\nHunting is a recognized and accepted sport that is enjoyed by a lot of people. I'm not a hunter but I have trained dogs in obedience and agility. Dog training does not require a dog to shred another living animal to pieces, which is what this kind of \"hunting\" is. Hunters i know eat what they kill and hunt in a way that minimizes the potential for suffering, and is as humane and ethical as possible. Humane and ethical hunters don't want to cause pain and suffering. Training dogs to kill coyotes, foxes, and rabbits in this way lead to these animals being killed by being ripped apart. And it's all done for fun. What a horrible death for these poor creatures. The animal is not hunted for food. It's just ripped apart - for fun - in a cruel and painful death I wouldn't wish upon anyone or anything. How is this activity humane or ethical? It's not. If this amendment is passed, the government will, in effect, be supporting animal cruelty.\nI'm not an activist but I don't think we should be encouraging cruelty to animals. I'm in the 905 region and enjoy all of the parkland in my local area. From time to time I am lucky to see a coyote or a fox or a rabbit. These creatures don't bother me or anyone else there. They just go about their business. They are important part of our natural surroundings and deserve respect and protection. We shouldn't be trapping them in pens and training dogs to rip them apart as some barbaric \"training\" activity.\nPlease don't amend the Act in the way that is being proposed by the Ontario government. This type of \"training\" should actually be made illegal, rather than offered expanded opportunities. It provides no benefit to society and is actually just sanctioned animal cruelty. If you carry through with it, you may as well also just legalize dog fighting while you're at it - because It's the same thing.\n",

Allowing dogs to attack and kill animals in this way increases aggressiveness in dogs. We do not need more aggressive dogs.\n2. Zoonotic diseases are a reality. For example, COVID is a zoonotic disease. We've recently had cases in Canada where dogs contracted avian flu from diseased animals. How will you be sure the wild animals do not have diseases that can transfer to dogs or humans? This creates unnecessary dangers for humans, pets, and agriculture in Ontario.\n3. It is inhumane. It causes unnecessary terror and torture for the animals who are put into a cage to be torn apart for sport. We already have plenty of hunting and fishing in Ontario that is legal, regulated and does not cause undue stress or torture for the animals.\n4. Where will these animals come from? Are we going to open wild animal breeding forms? That is yet another way that disease are spread from wild animals to humans.\nCanada is a beautiful country renowned for its wildlife.  Let's keep it that way. Ontario made this kind of hunting illegal.  There is no reason to legalise it.\n",

Penned dog hunting facilities are cruel to wild animals that are subjected to various methods used to train dogs to hunt. Wildlife should never be taken from their natural environments and held captive by hunters. It\u2019s especially cruel to use rabbits, coyotes, and foxes as pawns for hunters to train dogs and hold competitions.Opening applications for train and trial spaces after 25 years is a massive step backward into the past. These facilities have no place in Ontario. As a matter of fact, the province\u2019s existing 24 facilities need to be closed immediately. The Ontario government and enforcement personnel already have their hands full, so the last thing they need is more penned hunting compounds that they don\u2019t have the ability to comprehensively monitor.

        "comment":"I am commenting to oppose this proposal on the basis of several factors after careful consideration of both perspectives. In the wild, there are divisions of predator versus prey, and yes, that can be described as the circle of life. The issue here is that in the wild, an animal is chased and preyed upon with one of two results: it is caught or not caught, and that is natural. In these proposed areas, however, the chase never ends for the prey which in my opinion, is not only unnatural, but highly unethical. Furthermore, the training\/trials are a sport-  it is killing for the sake of it, but in the wild, a predator hunts prey out of   necessity for survival. While it is understandable that those in favour of this proposal argue the fact that if not allowed or increased then people will find illegal ways to do it, the reality is, there will always be individuals who will bypass rules and legality. Those in favour of this proposal also insist that regulations are in place for the sake of the hunting dogs and the wildlife, but how much can you truly regulate such an 'arena'? How can the hunters\/trainers ensure the wildlife are eating appropriately and have a fair chance when the trials begins? Can the owners completely ensure the prevention of injury or death to their own dogs? How can one justify a regulation where a live animal is being mauled; is there some way to make being eaten alive less fear provoking and painful for prey? I would argue that such 'training' is no different than dog fighting, just in this scenario the dogs are coyotes or foxes, or smaller more vulnerable prey. It is further somewhat contradictory that those in favour state this is for purposes of training and hunting practice but in a controlled environment because such an environment is just that; it will never be the real thing, and as a result it may actually put the hunting dogs at risk as they will not know what to do should something occur (such as a run in with a well matched predator) because they will be conditioned to the controlled environment. While I do not enjoy it or practice it myself, I am not against hunting. For example, my partner is a hunter and\nis indigenous; hunting has been and will always be a part of life- people do it, and animals do it themselves. Where I feel a line should be drawn, is when it is no longer performed respectfully, with zero recognition that another living beings life is ending. It is especially unethical to take the life of an animal in a tortuous manner if such a manner can be prevented. Are dogs called off of the prey once injured? Or are they allowed to attack the prey until its final moments? While wildlife can often be seen as pests yes, with foxes getting into chicken coops, raccoons ravaging through garbages and so on, it is very much worth considering that these animals started off from babies learning how to be 'their species' same as we do. I volunteer in wildlife rehabilitation and it has been a very rewarding experience to work with orphaned, injured and ill wildlife to provide them with a second chance at life. Have you ever held a young raccoon, it's little paws clasping onto you? These babies are vulnerable, and no different in needs than that of a human baby. Have you heard the cries of a baby starving to death while it wonders where its mother has gone? How can it be ensured that wildlife captured for use in these areas are not being taken from babies that they were meant to return to? Why does being older make it more 'okay' to be subject to attack? Would you be fine with a coyote tearing apart your adult dog? If not, then why is it moral when reversed? A coyote for example, would have the same fear in its eyes as you know your beloved dog would. After all, dogs are domesticated yes, but are not that different in genetics than those of wild canids.\nOverall, there are many ways in which to look at this training\/trials, both pros and cons I am sure. I ask that further thought goes into the different aspects of this proposal and the enforcement of regulations before a final decision is made. I ask with great passion and evidence that at this time this proposal is NOT passed. Thank you.\n",

There is no way to police what is taking place and therefore abuses are likely to occur. It is a practice that has absolutely no place in a civilized society. We know this because:\nWildlife should never be taken from their natural environments and held captive by hunters.\nRabbits, coyotes, and foxes are not pawns for hunters to use to train dogs and hold competitions - they are part of the ecosystem and like all mammals they experience complex emotions.\nThey deserve to be treated with respect. This proposal is not respectful and it is in fact a form of slavery.\nNot to mention the risk of zoonotic diseases. Have we learned nothing from the pandemic and what happens when stressed animals are kept in close contact with humans and in confined spaces?\nI sincerely hope the MNR is not seriously considering allowing new licenses and the transfer of licenses. It shows a complete disregard for the knowledge we have accumulated, often painfully, about how to live in harmony with the natural world.\nAny activities that encourage a lack of empathy and compassion, such as using wild animals for \"train and trial areas\", is a step backward. Why set the clock back 25 years? Other than to keep a minority of lobbyists happy?\nInstead of opening new applications, the province\u2019s existing 24 facilities need to be closed immediately.\nSincerely,\nMelissa (not a \"city dweller\", I live in rural Ontario)\n",

This amendment seeks to permit the issuance of licenses for new dog train and trial areas, as well as the transfer of licenses. Such a change would have detrimental effects on our wildlife and natural ecosystems.\nAllowing for new dog train and trial areas would disrupt the delicate balance of our wildlife habitats. Dogs, especially when used for training and trial purposes, can have significant negative impacts on native wildlife populations. Their presence can disturb and stress wildlife, disrupt breeding patterns, damage habitats, and even lead to the spread of diseases. This amendment disregards the importance of preserving our natural environments and the species that depend on them.\nFurthermore, the transfer of licenses creates a potential for unchecked expansion and abuse. Transferring licenses could result in the proliferation of dog train and trial areas without proper oversight and consideration of the environmental consequences. This amendment fails to prioritize the well-being of our ecosystems and the protection of our wildlife.\nIn light of these concerns, I implore you to reconsider this amendment and prioritize the conservation and protection of our natural heritage. We should be focusing on preserving and restoring our wildlife habitats, not introducing measures that have the potential to harm them. Our duty is to safeguard the integrity of our ecosystems for future generations, and this amendment undermines that fundamental responsibility.\n",

Penned hunting is incredibly cruel to the coyotes, foxes, and rabbits who are used as live bait and are chased and killed by packs of dogs. The dogs forced to participate can also suffer from injuries and death. Penned hunting will also negatively contribute to trapping animals which are then sold to the penned hunt locations.\nIn addition to animal cruelty, penned hunting is a public health risk. The trade and transportation of wildlife is a major contributor to the spread of disease and parasites, including zoonotic diseases that can infect wildlife, domestic animals, and humans.\nResearch is clear: more than four out of five Canadians are against hunting animals for sport. No other Canadian province allows penned dog hunting, and the cruel practice is unlawful in most of the United States.\nPlease do the right thing for animals and public health\u2014don\u2019t undo all of the progress made to phase out penned hunting facilities. Your government should instead focus on strengthening the existing legislation, and shutting down the few remaining train and trial areas in the province.\n",

The captive wildlife, including cottontail, snowshoe hare, red fox, and coyote, should never be subjected to such inhumane treatment. By confining these animals in fenced areas, the proposal not only denies them their natural freedom but also disrupts the ecological balance and natural behaviors essential for their survival.\nFurthermore, the use of these enclosed areas to conduct hunting dog competitions, commonly known as \"trialing,\" is equally troubling. These blood sports competitions promote a disregard for the welfare of wildlife and contribute to a culture that glorifies the pursuit and capture of animals for sport. Encouraging such activities is not only morally wrong but also undermines the efforts made by conservation organizations and ethical hunters to promote responsible and sustainable wildlife management.\nI urge the Ministry of Natural Resources and Wildlife of Ontario to reconsider this blood sports proposal and instead focus on promoting humane and sustainable practices that protect the welfare of wildlife and preserve our natural heritage. We must prioritize the conservation and well-being of our wildlife, recognizing their intrinsic value and the vital roles they play in maintaining healthy ecosystems.\nI respectfully request that you take immediate action to halt any plans to establish these enclosed areas for training and trial purposes and engage in a comprehensive consultation process with relevant stakeholders, including wildlife experts, animal welfare organizations, and concerned citizens.

        "comment":"There appears to be a strong bias to this proposal. Within the proposal details, I only see what is viewed as the positive effects to opening up training facilities and does not highlight any negative effects, and it appears there are many more negative effects.\n\u201cThe anticipated economic consequences of the proposal are expected to be largely neutral to positive. The proposed legislation would enable licences to be issued to new persons who were previously unable to obtain a licence. This removes barriers and creates an opportunity for new persons to participate in the existing regulatory framework\u201d then goes on to say \u201cThere is no specific fee associated with the transfer of a licence. Persons who wish to transfer their train and trial area to a new licence holder would be required to notify the ministry about the transfer and the new owner.\u201d New licence holders only pay 100$ per year, and there is no specific fee for transferring a licence. It\u2019s not like an abundance of money will flood into the OMNRF for these facilities to occur. I don\u2019t see where this is an economic benefit because the amount of time and effort put into filing applications, going through the approval process, and paying staff to do it does not balance out. The resources used to provide licences to an outdated practice is better used elsewhere in the ministry, one that is already tight for funding and budget cuts.\nThe thought would be to reduce underground practices and promote strict policies for running these facilities. It is a known fact that Ontario is extremely understaffed for conservation officers. Many hunters and anglers carelessly do whatever they please because they know the chances of them getting caught are few and far between, and they know where to avoid the CO\u2019s. Is there a guarantee that more officers will be hired so these facilities can be monitored to ensure they are keeping up with the strict standards? Will this proposal reduce underground facilities or will be just keep doing what they are doing anyways because there\u2019s not enough enforcement to catch them in the first place?\nAfter providing these training facilities, can hunters 100% guarantee that they can control their dogs from entering private properties or harassing non-target wildlife? Can the hunters run as fast as the dogs to ensure they are not out of site and entering private lands? There is no guarantee in this. Dogs do not see boundaries, they see the job they need to complete and will continue to pursue. Therefore, caging a wild animal into an enclosed space for training that is not 100% effective does not seem to reap the benefits of these facilities.\nCompetitions for canned hunting is barbaric and outdated. This shows that this demand for more issued licences is more then just establishing controlled training opportunities, it\u2019s also turning into a sporting event no different then other illegal events that encourages animals to attack or kill one another in an enclosed area.\n\"If they are in danger, they're in the ground, And I can assure you there's not very many dogs going to go in a 10-inch culvert when there's an alligator at the other end.\" If the dogs won\u2019t go into the safe spaces for the coyotes, which they\u2019re supposed to be trained to do, then what\u2019s the point of this? They\u2019re not hunting them anyways. This is not a fair chase because dogs will learn where the dens are and loiter around them. In a natural setting the wildlife would have a fair opportunity to escape.\nDuck hunters manage to train their duck dogs without penning waterfowl. Putting live animals into a pen is inhumane and torture for the animal.\nFox and coyotes are rabies vectors. What practices will be used to ensure that a rabid animal is not captured, stored into a pen, and ensure they are not transmitting the disease? Will they be quarantined?\nIs this practice humane for the dogs? Will they get hurt? Can you guarantee hunters don\u2019t remove teeth from these caged wildlife causing further torture?\nThere are much bigger issues in this province related to fish and wildlife that this funding needs to be implemented into. More enforcement needs to happen and greater fines need to be implemented for those breaking the law. Focus on the larger issues before creating more.\n",

Wild animals should not be confined to a private area for the sake of teaching pets to hunt for wild animals.  Dogs are a choice. Dogs do not need to be taught to hunt and do not need to hunt for survival.  Wildlife have been consistently getting pushed to the back for the last decade. Why have there not been any new laws put in place in recent times to protect them? Between land development stripping away whole ecosystems,  taking rights away from conservation authorities,  and allowing private partners get what they want whatever they want, wildlife keeps being forced to submit to whatever humans want and are constantly suffering at the hands of our decisions. Why do we think it's okay to keep destroying nature? Why do we feel like our private practices are so important and superior to nature? This is diabolical.\nDo better. Be better.\n",

        "comment":"Rather than increase issuance of new licenses for train and trial facilities, I believe it would be better practice to phase-out license renewals and transfers entirely.\nWhile these facilities sound reasonable in theory, in reality the practices within some facilities are more than questionable. Although they may be claimed to be \"in-compliance\" with the Fish and Wildlife Conversation Act and Criminal Code of Canada, it is far too easy for facilities to do the minimal effort, while still contributing to an unethical practice. This is a horrific practice that has been carried over from old European Colonization unethical hunting roots.\nAccording to the general fishing regulations in accordance with the Fish and Wildlife Conversation Act, a person who is ice fishing must be within 60m of their trap. The purpose for this regulation is for the longevity of the fish, not to tire the fish to exhaustion and death, but rather give the fish a chance at life after being caught, if the person is practicing catch and release. It is baffling that this kind of care is being given to a fish but not to Ontario's large land predators and meso predators.\nWhen domestic dogs tap into their primal instincts and impulses are not kept in check, one can not stop a pack of dogs from pinning their prey, be it coyote, fox or rabbit, then killing the animal by  ripping its body apart. How is that fair or ethnical practice to an wild animal? The wild animal was live-trapped, taken from a free-roaming life, placed in a fenced facility to live in a high-stress situation of being chased with possibly of being ripped limb-from-limb if it cannot hide in time on a regular basis.  When enacting ethical hunting practices on Crown land, the animals one hunts for are more often than not given a fair chance to escape or to hide. That is not always the case in these Train and trial facilities. Dogs are intelligent and driven, it is common in these facilities for dogs to block the wild animals path from escape, pin it to the outside of a fence or building and brutally kill it. This is not fair to the dogs, nor to the wild animal involved.\nMany policies and procedures are carried over from decades of poor resource management practices. When given a chance of policy and procedure review, why should archaic practices such as Train and Trial facilities still exist in the Ontario government? What percentage of economic benefit do they bring? What can be gained by keeping old colonization habits in a world of reconciliation? In a time of global species population decline why should we continue to be so cavalier with the unethical treatment of our common species on our landscape, because how long will they be considered \"common\" for? What possible gain or benefit could an increase in Train and Trial facilities license issuance bring to the Ontario government and it's general public?\n",

Who comes up with this gruesomeness??!\nThe proposed change is inhumane. I would never have thought I would be living in a world, in the Province of Ontario, just trying to get by living in the presence of such cruelty.\nPlease do not pass this extremely harmful unethical immoral proposal.\nIt is time we abolish hunting with dogs in Ontario rather than propose new measures to support and condone absolute violence against wildlife.\nNot every law is a good law. Not every law is right. These amendments could not be further from supporting any type of economical benefit based on the gruesomeness alone of this proposal. I am sure I am not alone in my absolute rejection of this revolting proposal.\nI truly feel Ontario has taken a path in the wrong direction on many counts concerning wildlife and nature. Wildlife need to be revered and protected. Not trapped and kept confined in a pen to be murdered by someone's dog.\nShame.\n",

Wolf Awareness strongly imposes the proposal to re-open the previously phased-out trial and train licensing process.\nIn the 1990s, social opinion had already shifted so strongly in opposition to the wanton destruction and cruel treatment of animals, including wildlife, that the previous Conservative government made the decision to phase out the licensing and operation of trial and train centres where dogs are trained to harm, harass and kill coyotes, rabbits and foxes. Given this decision and its social context, as well as the ongoing public intolerance of wildlife mistreatment in such places, it is both egregious and frankly shocking that the Ontario government would propose a reversal of the phase-out and appear to be proud of this proposal in the House of Commons discussions of Bill 91.\nBoth the dogs and the wildlife raised or released into these enclosures are at risk of serious harm both in trial and train centres as well as during hunting with dogs more generally. There is no ecological reason to hunt coyotes or foxes, as it provides no benefit to the ecosystem or to hunters, people do not eat these canids, and moreover hunting coyotes and wolves could shift and\/or exacerbate livestock losses and decrease the positive benefits of canids to farmers (rodent control, for example). There is therefore no defensible reason to promote hunting of wild canids with or without dogs. There does not seem to be any ecological reason to hunt lagomorphs, with hounds or otherwise, either. Rearing, keeping and teaching dogs to kill rabbits as well as their natural predators is redundant and unnecessarily costly.\nFarmers and other rural landowners frequently complain about trespassing by hunting dogs (e.g. at the Eastern wolf recovery planning meetings), and these trial and train areas will not solve this issue, but may possibly increase these negative interactions by promoting this type of hunting widely. The Ontario Government has made no improvements to preventing trespassing by hunters, including hound hunters. Despite changes to technology (e.g. GPS trackers on hounds) trespassing seems still to be common. It is not safe or even possible for landowners to attempt to remove a pack of hounds from their land, and dealing with hunters in these circumstances often ends in conflict and feelings of insecurity on the part of the landowners, which is inappropriate. Hound hunting on public land is also the most likely form of hunting to preclude other recreation on that land; it is alarming and possibly dangerous to encounter hounds on the trail of wildlife, especially for people walking dogs or travelling with small children.  Clearly this proposal benefits a small select demographic of Ontarians, while negatively impacting the vast majority of Ontarians.\nWolf Awareness is particularly concerned about negative impacts of this proposal on the threatened Eastern wolf. Genetic testing is required to accurately differentiate eastern coyotes and eastern wolves, which would be used in unknown numbers in these trial and train areas. Harming and harassing this species at risk merely for sport is disgusting, ecologically unsound and violates the purpose of the Endangered Species Act. There is no information in this proposal to suggest that eastern wolves would not be harmed in trial and train areas where coyotes are used as the target for hounds.\nThe proposal failed to outline how Ontario has dealt with wildlife welfare issues in the past at these centres, as well. Due to the nature of these facilities, where wildlife is trapped and either placed in the enclosure and\/or bred for future training targets, and dogs are trained to harm and harass the wildlife directly, it is impossible for the government to make assurances that any stringent animal welfare standards are upheld. The interaction of hounds chasing and destroying or injuring wildlife is inherently inhumane. That this inhumane treatment is happening under only the supervision of people who believe this treatment and the killing of wild canids and rabbits is morally justified, and that the enclosures are by legal definition closed, private, fenced areas guarantees that it will be impossible for the Ontario Government to uphold animal welfare there. While some hunters justify their hatred for carnivores and dedication to killing them by their opinion that wild carnivores cause damage in their natural depredation of herbivores, these same hunters do not appear to consider the wanton damage that hounds have on wildlife, especially wildlife such as canids that are not eaten by the hunters but merely killed for sport. This double standard is perplexing and gives the broader hunting community a poor reputation in the eyes of the Ontario public.\nThere are many ways for hunters to participate in hunting activities, and to earn a living doing so. The impacts of phasing out the handful of centres that still operate, compared to allowing dozens more in our province, is insignificant within the greater hunting industry. It will cost hunters far more money overall to keep hounds, a practice which is entirely unnecessary for successful hunting, and will not benefit the hunters or the ecosystems where they hunt at all. Allowing more trial and train areas is not an appropriate way to appease the hunting demographic in our province. If the Ontario Government wants to support hunters by increasing social tolerance of hunting, it must better regulate the activity (i.e. creating closed seasons for coyotes in Southern Ontario), enforce mandatory reporting and use that data in policy-making, and concentrate on the ecological, animal welfare and property protection outcomes of hunting on public and private land. Many other jurisdictions in North America know this already, and have banned this harmful practice outright. Ontario was following suit for many decades, making this abrupt shift all the more alarming.\nWolf Awareness requests that this proposal be immediately abandoned, that trial and train centres be phased out more quickly and that hunting with hounds be prohibited across the province to better protect wildlife, reduce injuries to hunting dogs, and balance the myriad perspectives on hunting in Ontario.\nSincerely,\nHannah Barron\nConservation Director\nWolf Awareness\n",

The practice of using dogs for hunting and for sport no longer has a place in our society. I am deeply concerned about the possibility of this amendment going through as it will only cause more suffering to wildlife who already struggle to survive the ever increasing urban sprawl. Forcing wildlife into pens to be chased down by dogs regularly will cause extreme stress on the animals and in my opinion should be considered animal cruelty. Rather than allowing more train and trial spaces to open, I strongly believe that the existing 24 locations should be permanently closed or phased out, as was the original intention of the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act, 1997.\nThank you.\nZachary.\n",

These proposed changes do not benefit anyone or anything except hunters and cause pain and suffering to terrorized animals.\nTo try and justify the proposed changes with statements such as \"These species have sustainable populations and there are no concerns with limited take of small numbers for licensed train and trial areas.\" is appalling. It's  not a matter of how many cottontails, snowshoe hares, coyotes, red foxes there are it's the fact that we're confining them in an area with the plan to inhumanely kill them.\nI'm disgusted by these proposed changes and hope that the voice of reason outweighs the wants of a small group of people.\n",

Supposedly a government that is concerned for animal welfare - except for wildlife apparently. Penned hunting has been proven to cause significant distress to the penned animals and it is entirely unethical to even allow this in the first place. The proposed changes to allow new train and trial areas as well as transfer of licenses are a step in the wrong direction and demonstrate a lack of consideration for both animal welfare and the interests of the general public - beyond that of just the hunting community. It is incredibly disappointing to be represented by a government so unconcerned with animal suffering - I would really hope for more. No other Canadian province allows penned dog hunting - Ontario has an opportunity to be a leader in animal welfare rather than reverting to a cruel past. Instead of opening new applications, the province\u2019s existing 24 facilities need to be closed immediately.\nDo better. Be better than those that came before you - this is not it.\n",

This minimizes the chances of dogs pursuing the wrong species. Properly trained dogs can correctly identify the correct prey species and will concentrate on it, thereby diminishing the chance that protected species, non game species or even domestic livestock may be incorrectly pursued by poorly trained dogs.\nHaving properly trained dogs also improves the chances of a hunter retrieving harvested game with a trained dog that would otherwise be too difficult to locate.\nHunters and dog owners that take their dogs to trials and or training sites bolster local economies by spending on travel expenses like fuel, food, hotels etc. which is a benefit to local businesses.\nThere are of course health benefits to being out in the field, actively participating in the training of the dogs.  This benefits not only the handler but the dogs themselves as well as the trainers, judges etc.\nThere are strict guidelines to ensure that the prey species are treated humanely, and that they are properly cared for while in captivity.\nThey use of hunting dogs has a long bison our province and it is a big part of our hunting heritage.  Hunters and dog handlers should be able to properly train their dogs not only for their benefit, but for the benefit of non prey and protected species.\nThank you for allowing me to provide input.\n",

As a concerned citizen and advocate for animal welfare, I firmly believe that such practices are not only ethically unacceptable but also pose a threat to the well-being and conservation of our precious wildlife.\nThe proposal to enclose areas on private land for the purpose of training dogs in blood sport skills, such as picking up scent trails, tracking, and pursuing game, is nothing short of barbaric. The captive wildlife, including cottontail, snowshoe hare, red fox, and coyote, should never be subjected to such inhumane treatment. By confining these animals in fenced areas, the proposal not only denies them their natural freedom but also disrupts the ecological balance and natural behaviors essential for their survival.\nFurthermore, the use of these enclosed areas to conduct hunting dog competitions, commonly known as \"trialing,\" is equally troubling. These blood sports competitions promote a disregard for the welfare of wildlife and contribute to a culture that glorifies the pursuit and capture of animals for sport. Encouraging such activities is not only morally wrong but also undermines the efforts made by conservation organizations and ethical hunters to promote responsible and sustainable wildlife management.\nI urge the Ministry of Natural Resources and Wildlife of Ontario to reconsider this blood sports proposal and instead focus on promoting humane and sustainable practices that protect the welfare of wildlife and preserve our natural heritage. We must prioritize the conservation and well-being of our wildlife, recognizing their intrinsic value and the vital roles they play in maintaining healthy ecosystems.\nI respectfully request that you take immediate action to halt any plans to establish these enclosed areas for training and trial purposes and engage in a comprehensive consultation process with relevant stakeholders, including wildlife experts, animal welfare organizations, and concerned citizens. Together, we can work towards a future that respects the rights and dignity of all living beings and ensures the preservation of our wildlife for generations to come.\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will give due consideration to these concerns and take appropriate steps to prevent the implementation of this barbaric proposal.\n",

Keeping wild animals in pens so they are trapped before being captured by a predator (dogs) is exceptionally inhumane. There are other methods and avenues hunters can utilize before engaging in this type of animal cruelty (they have been already and making this change will do little to nothing for hunters moving forward). This just seems like a very unnecessary initiative and practice. Humane societies across the province will also be up in arms. From an image perspective, the department\/and government does not need that kind of scrutiny.\n",

Ontario has well thought out regulations for the current areas in existence.\nMy concern is that the proposal only allows for a \"one time application period\".\nI feel that the one time period doesn't take into consideration Ontario residents that may have future interest in building and maintaining one of these facilities. Though licenses may be transferable, if one isn't available it would leave a party that could meet all the requirements otherwise unable to build a facility. I worry that this limits the ability of new participants and young people to have equal opportunity that other Ontarians may have in the \"one time application\".\nRegardless of these concerns, I'm very much in favour of this proposal and hope to see it or a version of it in our regulations.\nThank-you.\n",

The victims of this terrible practice - like timid coyotes, frightened foxes, peaceful cottontails -  can be legally trapped and taken from their homes. Torn away from their families, these animals are then forced into pens to live the rest of their lives experiencing intense fear, trauma and extreme stress as they are horrifically chased down by dogs on a regular basis.\nIn 1997, this archaic practice was set to be phased out when the FWCA declared no new licences would be issued and that existing licences could not be transferred. But now, under the proposed change, more train and trial areas would be allowed to open and existing ones could be transferred to new owners. UNACCEPTABLE!  Rather than being phased out, these unspeakable areas will become more prevalent. More innocent victims will be stolen from the wild and forced into a life that no living being deserves to live.

At a time that we as a society should be trying to find ways to live more harmoniously with the planet and all the creatures that we share it with, in Ontario we are going backwards.   The capture of wild foxes and coyotes to be held captive to allow dogs to hunt them down is unethical and inhumane and pose a real threat to wildlife and humans.  Wildlife removed from public areas to then be hunted for profit is not a business model that will benefit the province in any way.  Even more concerning is the complete lack of empathy or respect for these animals and there is almost no information with respect to regulations that would protect the number of animals allowed to be hunted at one time versus the number of dogs, or how the trapped animals would be transported and housed.
